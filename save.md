This wave then has highs and lows. The coming 'deep-low' is our prediction of an economic crisis which we arrived at by observing how prices fluctuated from the 13th century up to recent times.  

## Everything is a wave and a particle is merely a slice of a wave from a different viewpoint

On the everyday level, particles and waves are easily discernable. 
- The nature of a table 'object' is different from the nature of a sound 'wave'
- The nature of water in a glass is different from the nature of the ocean moving as waves. 
  
But in the quantum level, when nature of the particle is thoroughly analyzed, the distinction between particles and waves become blurred as explained by wave-particle duality:

{{< youtube Q_h4IoPJXZw >}}

Hume explains that this defect is due to the limitations of the human mind:

{{< quote ava="hume" >}}
<p>The capacity of the mind is limited and can never attain a full and adequate conception of infinity.. In rejecting the mind’s infinite capacity, we suppose it may arrive at an end in the division of its ideas.. Therefore, the imagination may reach a minimum idea which it cannot further subdivide or reduce without annihilating it.. The same is true for the impressions of the senses and the imagination.. The minute parts of distant bodies do not convey any sensible impression.. because.. their impressions were reduced to a minimum.</p>
{{< /quote >}}


Thanks to technology, we can now perceive the smallest units of matter, only to see that they are made up of strings which have the nature of indivisible waves, just as 'love' can be both an idea or a feeling. These waves or impressions are ultimately by perceived by human feeling, which has a different nature from human intellect.

{{< quote ava="hume" >}}
<p>The impressions which enter by our five senses do not resemble the actual objects. Consequently, the idea of identity, which is supposed to be real, can never be derived from any of these senses. Therefore, the feeling is the only sense remaining that can convey the impression.<br><br>With regard to the passions, the human mind.. resembles a stringed instrument. After each stroke, the vibrations still retain some sound which gradually and insensibly decays. <!-- The imagination is extremely quick and agile. But the passions are slow and restive. This is why, when any object is presented that affords a variety of views to the one, and emotions to the other, the fancy may change its views very quickly. --></p>
<cite>Hume, Treatise of Human Nature</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

Ideas can be lost easily, but feelings take time to disappear. This is because an idea is an external particle (comes from outside) which can 'escape' the mind, while feelings are continuous as an internal wave (comes from inside) which are struck and vibrated in the mind. Also, the mind can convert a feeling into an idea just as reality can convert light waves into light particles. 

Even if a feeling is converted into an idea, its true nature still is that of a feeling (i.e. feelings cannot be traded, for example, but it can be spread like sound via sympathy). You can never 'dispose' of your love by giving it to another person. Instead, you can only make that person feel some of it through actions, and even then, it will not be exactly in the same degree as yours.

{{< img alt="Wave particle slice" cap="A particle is merely a 'slice' of a wave observed by the individual mind. The imperfect human mind sees the wave as a particle, but the perfect omniscient Mind sees it as a wave, its true form." src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/waveparticle-new-page.png" >}}

What we see as a gold coin gives our senses a small impression, which we then convert as an idea-'particle' of a gold coin. If we were omniscient, then we would not only perceive the gold coin as a coin, but also as bullion being minted, as gold ore being turned into bullion, as star dust being turned into gold ore, and as start dust being formed from the Big Bang  -- all at the same time. In short, we would know everything about that gold coin as a wave from its absolute past to its absolute future*.

> *According to Eastern Philosophy, there is no absolute past nor future, we just put it here for explanation

Our above explanation, if applied in physics, can help explain the strange and spooky things in quantum mechanics. In fact, by extending Hume's maxims, the universe's true principles can be discovered, which can then allow instant travel through space* (i.e. teleportation) and time (i.e. time travel) without needed huge amounts of stored energy.

> *We call this [the theory of gravitational signatures](/material/fallacies/general-relativity/)

## The Ideas of Capitalism and Profit Maximization are Blocking The natural Wave

The Marginal Revolution overturned Classical Economics (which we are advancing) and introduced ideas that led to the following corrupted concepts:

- [Profit Maximization](/social/economics/fallacies/profit-maximization-is-absurd) and [Equity Trading](/social/economics/capitalism) in Microeconomics
- [Liquidity Preference](/research/keynes/general-theory/chapter-02) in Macroeconomics

These ideas then created policies that were imposed on all, resulting to problems for all:

Policy or Solution | Bad Effect or New Problem
--- | ---
Deficit spending | Public Debt as increased taxation and reduced governments
Interest rate setting | Money markets (Financial Crises) and Quantitative easing
Corporate law | Mergers and Too-big-to-fail
Stock trading and stock markets | Stock crashes
Institutions such as Bretton Woods | Debt Crises


<!-- to spread themselves via a wave of collective human selfishness that has always existed, as proven by past crises such as the 1772 credit crunch, Mississippi Scheme, South Sea Bubble, etc. -->

<!-- Even if you had a great idea and desire to create a new product or service, you will still have to get money from someone. Ordinarily, that someone will just think whether he will get his money back, maybe with some interest. But nowadays, people think whether it will be profitable to lend or invest. The idea of return on investment ROI blocks the natural tendency to invest and circulate money which then hinders work from being mobilized and things being developed. 

Unfortunately for the world, Smith and Hume (and even Marx in a way) said that profits naturally fall with economic development, and so keeping the idea of profit maximization at a time of low profits (or developed world) will just lead to [secular stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_stagnation).

<p>An extensive commerce produces large stocks which reduces both interest and profits. It is always assisted, in its diminution of the one, by the proportional sinking of the other. Low profits arise from the encrease of commerce and industry, they serve in their turn to its farther encrease, by rendering the commodities cheaper, encouraging the consumption, and heightening the industry. And thus, if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects, interest is the barometer of the state, and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing condition of a people. Those who have asserted, that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest, seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause.</p>
<cite>Hume, Essays</cite>
</div>

## So how do we get rid of the bad ideas from Economics?

Since waves are continuous, they cannot be removed, but only 'toned down'. Ideas on the other hand can be dislodged. Since particles are dislodged by other particles, then the bad ideas of profit maximization and outside equity can be dislodged by more sustainable ideas that are in Superphysics such as:

- [A model of supply and demand](/social/economics/fallacies/supply-demand) to replace the law of supply and demand
- [Dharma](/social/economics/principles/invisible-hand) and [the effort theory of value ](/social/economics/principles/effort-theory-of-value) instead of Utility, marginal utility, and profit maximization
- [Wealth preference](/social/economics/why-qe-failed) and the DCIT model instead of Liquidity preference and the IS-LM curve 
- [Purchasing Power](/social/economics/solutions/gdp) instead of GDP
- Debt and Limited Partnerships instead of [Equity and corporations](/social/economics/capitalism)


These then convert an economy from being a static system for creating treasure-particles, into a dynamic one where there is a constant creation and flow of value-waves. Since laws have sanctified profits, equity, and nominal value, and has entrenched them fully in human minds, only a very urgent and serious need, such as that arising from a new economic crisis, will be able to start the process of dislodging those ideas. Hopefully, that future crisis would be so severe as to be able to even dislodge Economics, as a compound idea-particle, too.

{{< q a="smith" c="The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 5, Chapter 2" >}}
The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.

American culture teaches everyone to proft from everyone. Superphysics: That is the necessary effect of liberalism.

Translate to Spanish: How can we stop Covid-19? What is the solution to terrorism? Can poverty and inequality be solved? How do we prevent global warming? What is gravity? What came before the 'big bang'? Where does life come from? Does God exist? All these questions remain unanswered by Science because it is limited to the five senses. We need a new framework of knowledge that goes beyond the obvious and into the root causes of phenomena so that we can answer questions conclusively. That's why we created Superphysics. Superphysics is a new paradigm that combines science and metaphysics in order to answer the unanswered, and solve the unsolved. It unifies the scientific knowledge of the West and the intuitional traditions of the East so that we can view the world from a fresh, new perspective. Don't be stuck at mysteries. Find answers through Superphysics.

It debunks the big bang because the findings did not match the prediction. 

Big Bang clearly predicts a linear sequence of bang then hot gas then small galaxy then large galaxy. 

If it is bang then large galaxy then the Big Bang is not in force.

The Big Bang is a result of Newtonian Physics. 

Before Newtonian Physics, there was Descartes Physics which did not believe in a Big Bang. 

Instead, the universe was created by aether then light then matter, as space, then large galaxy. This matches the findings of James Webb of bang then large galaxy.

So they need to bring back Descartes' Physics and let it absorb Newtonian Physics.

33 degrees 
steel for ajna chakra


What was the supposed minimum height and width of the device? 33 degrees seems very flat. If so, then it would require a larger size, something that cannot be put on one's chest (heart chakra).

Documented evidence:

Medicine: 
1. Chinese medicine
2. Ayurveda

Gravitation:
1. Pyramids of Egypt
2. Walls of Jericho falling
3. Levitating Monks
4. UFO sightings by US Navy

Probability:
1. Winning in games of chance
2. Prophecy
3. Quantum tunneling (the aether increases probability)

The root cause of the problem is they use Newtonian Physics to measure the expansion of a non-Newtonian universe. 

The proper answer is 74 km and not the 67 km which is derived from the CMB using 'dark matter' which doesn't exist. 

The Refsdal paper tries to solve this by using gravitational lensing and also falls in the Newtonian-Einsteim trap of 67 km.

That trap is the belief that gravity comes from matter. In reality, gravity comes from the aether. This is measured by doppler effect which is the correct way. 



Quantum and subatoms are still based on quantitative measurements. The aether is not countable because it is one big thing that is beyond space and time. 

Its properties are detected through large amounts of space and time. 

In my example, it is in the long time from the 18th century and the 1980s when the speed of light was formalized. 

Another example is the large space covered by LIGO. 

This is why only old civilizations such as the Egyptians, Indians, and Chinese had aether technology. The Roman civilization ended too early to discover it.

So thinking about the aether in quantum or particle terms is a dead end. Otherwise, the LHC would have reveled the aether by now. They only revealed the Higgs boson which is part of the Earth-Aether and not of the pure Aether. 

Rather, its parts has different qualities, largely as Pritvi, Tejas, and Akasha.

We never say that the 'quantum' result of the elections is Biden. Nor do we say that Biden was the emergent pre-determined property of the Elections. 


But the speed of light is not important in the aether and spacetime technologies. It is only important to makers of electromagnetic equipment such as LIGO and Radio Astronomy. Detecting Nature is different from Harnessing Nature.



Replace Einsten's relativity (which only has light-based material time), with Poincare's relativity where there is both material time and mental time. 

Wrap Lorentz' transformations t' = γ(t - vx/c^2) with Mental Time T to get a "aethereal Cartesian  plane" which is different from the physical Cartesian plane which has the Lorentz transformations.  

When applied to the speed of light, the center point of the aethereal Cartesian plane shows to be 299,792.458, a point where there is no more aether wind (i.e. the aether has stabilized).

When applied to LIGO, it just shows the low-level aether wind, as gravitational waves, on a physical Cartesian plane since physical aether is less dynamic. Here, the aethereal Cartesian plane has no use. 

A more common proof of the high-level aether being 'above' spacetime is you getting an intuition of the winning raffle number now before the raffle was drawn. 

This means that future aethereal information teleported to you earlier ahead of its own material reality. 

This teleportation does not happen 100% of the time. We say that it is probabilistic. This is in line with the aether being subject to probability. 

This probability increases with the amount of high-level aether that you have, just as a heavy boulder on a table will have more probability of crushing the table than a lighter rock.

So it means that you will be able to get the future information of the winning raffle numbers the more aether you have. This can be tested by having a control that gambles without aether and another one that has aether through many repetitions. Here, the aethereal Cartesian plane is useful in determining the impact of the aether.

We use such a system to prove that we can make a 1 kg mass lighter through the aether, without any contact forces. This would then lead to levitation and teleportation. 

However, we found that it is probabilistic (i.e. hit or miss) since the aether in small scales is dynamic, but less dynamic in large scales such as in LIGO. Sometimes it works, most of the times it doesn't.

We are software developers and not physicists and so we do not have equipment to isolate the mass to increase the probability. Our best hope is to use IoT and machine learning for it to increase the probability by continuous trial and error.

## Particle-based Math

An example of a 'particle-based' equation is Newton's second law:


``` elixir
F = ma
```

An example of a 'wave-based' equation is that of Maxwell:

``` elixir
∮B→⋅dℓ→=μ0(I+ddt(ε0∫E→⋅dA→))
```

Such equations are common in linear algebra which might be too complicated for most people. <!-- For example, it wouldn't be so easy for most people to understand the video below: {{< youtube >}} --> The problem is that pure math is quantitative in nature and not qualitative. Because of this, everything has to be defined beforehand. <!-- For example, in the video, Maxwell’s equation is given as: --> It's easy to know what is meant by `F` `m` `a`, but it's harder to know what `dℓ ∮B μ0 I ddt ε0∫E dA` mean.

The problem is that the processes such as `dℓ` must accommodate numerical variables* such as `dA` in order to come up with a result, as a number. This requires all of the processes to be known. If one is wrong, then the answer is automatically wrong. 

> *The variables represent shortcuts which then come from a quality of convenience which come from the laziness or staticity of mind. 


It would be like requiring a house-builder to know a house’s entire blueprint before the house is built. This limits the number of house-builders to a few, reducing the number of new houses. Now think that those people are spaceship-builders and navigators instead of house-builders, and you will see an extreme shortage that will increase the cost of space-travel accordingly.

No, the aether is the medium for spacetime. Spacetime is the medium for electromagnetism (light and c). 

The speed of light limited to c by spacetime which is limited by the aether to a single universe among infinite multiverses.

Therefore the speed of light is not constant. Nor is our universe a constant single universe.

The drag is seen in the differences in the speed of light taken from 1729 to 1983 (the time factor in spacetime which limits c) If there were no aether drag then all measurements of light would be 301,000 km/s (the early Bradley measurement). 

In Cartesian physics, the Michelson-Morley experiment was really a speed of light measurement, one of many measurements done by human beings through time in the same space (Earth). It shows that the drag is decreasing, which is consistent with the accelerated expansion of spacectime measured by the Hubble and James Web Telescope.

E=mc2 is only true for things that interact with electromagnetism. It does not apply to those that are beyond electromagnetism, such as gravitation, spacetime, and the aether. 

1. It is only true for electromagnetic types of energy, up to those that manifest as contact forces
2. Mass is the effect of Electromagnetically-detectable potential energy. Newton determined the mass of Jupiter by seeing photons bounce off it onto his telescope. 
3. The speed of light is determined by spacetime and not by mass. I.e. the whole equation is inside spacetime

Vegetables which require direct sunlight should not be planted with creeping tubers because the creepers will cover the other plants. 

For example, cauliflower needs direct sunlight, so it should not be planted with creepers.

**All tuber crops should be harvested only after the stalk dries up.** 

If the stalks of tubers are allowed to grow freely, the plants will bear flowers and seeds, but the tubers may disappear. 

The stalks of onion tubers should be twisted down before harvesting.

**Rotten vegetables are the best manure for green vegetables**

mustard cakes are fertilizer and pest repellant

The land between banana plants must not remain vacant. The following crops can be planted:

1. Áśáŕha to Kárttika – turmeric and black gram.
2. Agraháyańa to Mágha – sweet potato or sweet juice potato and winter chilli or winter brinjal. 

The seedlings should be quite big.

3. Phálguna to Jyaeśt́ha – peanut or ginger under the ground and sesame or soybean above the ground.

If human perfection is a 100% score The educated humans think that humanity is around 80% and perfection is near. 

In reality, humans are only at 35%. The re-discovery and initial use of the aether will be the marker for the 50% mark. This is similar to the discovery of electromagnetism as electricity being the entry to the 30% score. The discovery of and manipulation of spacetime, as action at a distance and the teleportation and levitation of masses will be the 40% mark. The total mastery of all of these would be 100% mark. At that point, humans will transition into another species that is no longer purely material in nature, but one that can switch from matter to light and light to matter. This latter is similar to human street performers who act as statues (material non-living objects) at public areas. We can act like rocks and stay immobile all day -- but it doesn't make sense. Similarly, light-beings can downgrade themselves into physical beings, but it won't make sense. Accordingly, it rarely happens and such occurences really expose problems with such light-beings just as we would call a man who acted like a statue as weird.

<div class="panel">
<small>* Truth is the equivalence of a metaphysical idea with its physical reality or perception. Both the idea of unicorns and of God, as a giant man in the sky, have no equivalent physical existence. Yet most religions believe in such a giant floating God because such an idea serves to <i>awe</i> humans and <b>puts their relatively small ego in check</b>. This then fulfills the goal of private morality as mentioned in the previous chapter, something that a belief in unicorns cannot achieve. Instead of using truth as what the Indians did, or of using the idea of an all-powerful Allah as what the Prophet Mohammad did, Confucius chose to check human ego through rigid rituals and by saving face.</small>

Prout 9 12 13 15 18 10 Bangladesh 



The failure of Prout to be established from the 1990s to the 2010s manifests as the world having no solution to the current stagflation.

Its principles decree "maximum utilization", "rational distribution", and "proper adjustment", but do not explain how they will actually be done in reality. 

This is because its founder thought like a deity who could materialize things by will. Yes, the principles are sound, but those are only true at the end phase where everything has been perfected. 

It would be like an 17th century inventor having a vision for a motorcycle and then starting work immediately a motorcycle when the combustion engine hasn't even been invented yet. The project would be guaranteed to fail.  

The correct way is to start with a bicycle and then to perfect it step by step until it becomes a perfected motorcycle. 

This is how Soichiro Honda started with making metal-spoked wheels in 1928 to replace wooden spokes. He then made bicycles, and then bicycle motors, which then evolved to become motorcycles. 

Similarly, the principles of Prout require a barter system which starts off as an exchange platform that will let people get services. 

This will then evolve into an employment system that matches the Buddhist system of 'right livelihood' that is in line with one's dharma. This matches Prout Principle 3.

This will then lead to Buddhist Economics which prioritizes the well-being of all entities, matching the principle of minimum requirements and Prout Principle 2.

This will lead to reduced consumption, less waste, and less energy use, matching Prout Principles 4 and 5

These will then lead to less exploitation whether of humans or plants and animals, matching Prout Principle 1

The base or starting point of Prout is therefore the barter system, just as the starting point of Honda's motorcycles were metal-spoked wheels. 

Ask any Proutist how they will implement and scale a barter system globally, they will reply with a blank stare. This is why Prout is currently nowhere.  

We solve this through a scalable barter system that can work online or offline and package it as non-dogmatic Buddhist Economics. 

https://superphysics.org/research/schumacher/buddhist-economics/part-2



The flaw of Prout is that it starts off with the end goal or intended result. 


1. No individual can accumulate any physical wealth without the clear approval of the collective body.
2. There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of all mundane, supramundane and spiritual potentialities of the universe.
3. There should be maximum utilization of physical, metaphysical and spiritual potentialities of unit and collective bodies of human society.
4. There should be a proper adjustment amongst these physical, metaphysical, mundane, supramundane and spiritual utilizations.
5. The method of utilization should vary in accordance with changes in time, space and person, and the utilization should be of progressive nature.

The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.

<!-- This instinct of self-preservation in turn is based on Nature's law of having diversity and **protecting** that diversity through metaphysical and physical means. This is easily seen in a rainforest where diversity is at its highest.
- The richness of a forest allows a lot of plants which allows a lot of animals.
- These animals allow "predator" species which limit the expansion of the animals in order to protect the plants. 

Having no predators will allow the animals to overrun the plants and make the area barren, like in pastures overrun by herds of deer and cattle.

A person who is ignorant of this Law of Nature will see predators as evil and dangerous. With this corrupted moral sense, he will try to kill all predators so that all prey can be free. The prey will then create an imbalance and overrun the lower lifeforms supporting the ecosystem, causing a decline for all.  

On the other hand, a person who prefers predation will encourage their growth by making prey easier to kill. For example, he could funnel their migration routes into ambush zones through wire-fences. This would create a boom in predator population which will then fight each other for the few remaining prey, leading to a similar decline for all.     


### The Four Dominant Mentalities

Thus, the ecosystem of human society has predators or alpha males that keep the people in check for the sake of a sustainable social order. There are four alpha male types as dominant mentalities:

Superphysics Name | Socratic Name | Hindu Name
--- | --- | ---
Populist | Democrat | Shudra
Militant | Tyrant | Ksattriya
Philosopher | Aristocrat "The Best" | Brahmin
Merchant | Oligarch "Rule by Possessions" | Vaeshya  


Two of these band together to defeat the other two. This bi-party tendency seems to be a quirk of the human species and is seen in:
- pros vs cons
- benefit vs cost
- Republican vs Demcrat
- Capitalist vs Communist

A more advanced species would be able to think of a third perspective so that a middle ground would also exist:
- pros vs compromise vs cons
- benefit vs need vs cost
- Republican vs Bipartisan vs Demcrat
- Capitalist vs Non-aligned vs Communist -->

The [previous post](/maharlika/economics/dutertenomics) explained the problem with the Keynesian Dutertenomics, which is embodied in the neoliberal economic plan called "Ambisyon 2040" by Arsenio Balisacan.


## Society Subsidizing the Rich

The main flaw of that plan was that it catered to the merchant class of society and neglected [the other 3 classes](/social/supersociology/principles/part-1/chapter-05/). That class is made up of business and monied interests.


Class | Socratic Name | Hindu Name | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
Traders | Oligarchs "The Few" | Vaesya | Businessmen, Banks, Traders
Workers | Democrats "The Many" | Shudra | Workers, Employees, General labor (Farm labor, fishermen, maids, etc)
Warriors | Tyrants | Ksattriya | Government, Military, Police
Thinkers | Aristocrats "The Best" | Brahmin | Universities, Researchers, Inventors, Religions 


A society needs all 4 classes to be in good shape just as a human body needs all its organs working properly. A weakness in one organ leads to disease or even death. 

With the 3 classes weakened, the Philippine economy easily collapsed after pandemic struck. To get back on its feet, it had to incur a huge Php 12 trillion debt.

The debt is in money which is the expertise of the monied interests. **Thus, the solution to the problem created by the merchant class is also facilitated by that same merchant class.** 

It would be like getting thieves to be in charge of security in your estate. They would allow expert burglaries which can only be solved by themselves to keep themselves employed and relevant while gaining commissions from those burglars. This leads to a double revenue stream to help keep them in power for a very long time until someone can connect the dots and expose their scam.   

Such a genius scheme in macroeconomics really began in the 1970s after the Nixon shock. Billionaire investor Jeremy Grantham explains:

{{< youtube hIKG2YpFoFQ >}}



The profit maximization doctrine of the merchant class stops growth. And so the merchant class lobbies for public debt, as Keynesian "deficit spending". This is really paid for by the entire society. 

Thus, the public subsidizes the lavish lifestyle of the overgrown merchant class.

The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.

{{< q a="smith" >}}
In her present condition, Great Britain resembles an unwholesome body with some overgrown vital parts. Her blood vessel was artificially swelled beyond natural by the industry and commerce forced to circulate in it. A small stop in that great blood-vessel will bring the most dangerous disorders on the whole political body.
<cite>The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 4, Chapter 7</cite>
{{< /q >}}



Debt transfers the present huge burden and spreads it to the future in smaller chunks. Instead of one huge oppression now, the oppression is imposed gradually and with increasing weight.


{{< q a="smith" >}}
This practice puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period to an indefinite period, never likely to come.

However, it raises more money than the old practice of anticipation.
<br><br>
When men became familiar with funding, it became universally preferred to anticipation during great state exigencies.

Relieving the present exigency is always the object of government. The future liberation of the public revenue they leave to the care of posterity.
<cite>The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 5, Chapter 3</cite>

Here, we explain the proper solution as **Maharlika 2050** which puts the merchant class back in line with the other classes, specifically by:
- overhauling Filipino Catholic-Islamic mentality into Maharlikan Science-Math thinking
- repealing dual citizenship in order to raise revenues
- banning crypto and NFT to reduce inflation and global warming
- hybrid PPP to create green energy and food sovereignty
- traditional barter trade to insulate against financial and debt crises


## The Invisible Colonial Curse

The main problem of the country is poverty and inequality brought by years of colonial and neocolonial rule.
- The **colonial rule** was done through Spain and its military and Church<!-- , through its weapons and tactics -->. This is the dominance of the militant class (Spanish navy) and the philosopher class (Spanish Catholic Church)
- The **neocolonial rule** was done through the US and its mercant-class financial system (debt and equity-globalization)

These 2 phenomena stifle the natives (populist class) who end up as:
- overseas slaves called OFWs (overseas Filipino workers)
- lowly call center agents

This is very different from advanced countries which are the employers of those OFWs and call center agents.

## The Maharlikan Plan 

<!--  and Maharlikan Constitutional Virtues -->

To convert a nation of slaves and employees into a respectable one of productive pioneers and innovators (and [be relevant on the world stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=589s6x9pjhU), we change the identity of the Philippines into [Maharlika](/maharlikanism). 

The very first step is to establish a moral system based on [constitutional virtues](/social/supersociology/solutions/constitutional-virtues) chosen by the people. We suggest 8 virtues:

1. Katotohanan (Truth)
2. Puso (Heart)
3. Pagtitimpi (Self-control)
4. Paggalang (Respect)
5. Talino at Kakayahan (Intellect and Skill)
6. Sipag at Pagkukusa (Hard work and Initiative)
7. Bayanihan (Cooperation)
8. Paggalang sa Kalikasan (Environmentalism)


These define what a Maharlikan is. These are not hard-coded, but can be changed every few years. 

France has its own version of constitutional virtues as:
- Liberty
- Equality
- Fraternity

With this new identity, the people stop being Filipinos or subjects or employees of King Philip, and become Maharlikan, an independent people with their own mind.  

{{<img src="/photos/medieval/lapu.jpg" alt="Lapu Lapu" cap="Lapu Lapu is the first Western-recorded person to exhibit Maharlikan virtues. Datu Puti and the Negrito king who welcomes him are also pre-colonial examples." >}}

These virtues can lead to a new culture and rules that can replace the morals of Spanish Catholicism and American liberalism. They will be the template for policy-changes that can be implemented until the 2050's when our model predicts a big social change to happen. 




### 1. Open Religious Policy (Truth)

The main obstacle to identity is the Catholic and Islamic religions that were created in Europe and Arabia, respectively. **Those countries are not tropical, not archipelagos, nor have many natural disasters** like Maharlika. 

Moreover, those religions had a political agenda that serves the interests of Europe and Arabia. For example:
- **Christianity depicts God as a white male in the sky**. This makes Christian Filipinos subconsciously think that whites are superior. This does not afflict the Muslim Filipinos who can criticize Western ideas and policies
- **Islam requires Muslims to make a pilgrimage to Mecca**. This makes Muslim Filipinos spend for that trip which is a clear benefit to Saudi Arabia's economy, and a loss to the Philippine economy because the Saudis are not obligated to visit the Philippines in return.

An open religious policy can:
- stop overpopulation by allowing abortion and contraception
- stop domestic violence by allowing divorce
- reduce the incidence of terrorism like the Marawi seige
- when combined with policy-change #6, spur critical thinking and raise the people's intellectual level by increasing the variety of abstract cognitive experiences
- increase productivity by replacing formal prayer (with its overhead) with informal ideation 


{{< q a="smith">}}
The religious teachers' interested zeal can be dangerous when only one sect is tolerated or when the society is divided into two or three great sects.
<cite>Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter 1</cite>

### 2. Single Citizenship and Leasehold (Heart)

Dual citizenship allows a person to have a safety and revenue from another country while spending it in Maharlika where prices are lower. This builds his ego over the single-citizens who have no such safety nor overseas revenue.

A clear example is how the owner of ABS-CBN disobeyed constitutional rules against foreign ownership of media<!--  in order to act as a kingmaker -->. 

Removing dual citizenship thus gives the government power over its own citizens. It also prevents dual citizens from owning land and other assets which inflate those prices for single citizens. 

Those ex-dual citizens will then be treated as foreign permanent residents who will have to sell their assets and pay for visa renewal and other restrictions.  **These will lower asset prices while giving more revenue to government to pay for the huge 12 trillion peso debt.** This policy thus **makes the rich pay for the debt**, in line with Adam Smith's taxation maxim quoted earlier. 

{{< q >}}
Dual allegiance of citizens is inimical to the national interest and shall be dealt with by law.
<cite>1987 Constitution</cite>
{{< /q >}}


This policy also leads to leasehold and freehold system which is different from the private property system inherited from the US. This is important in calculating a 'just compensation" which will not be disadvantageous to the government. 

{{< q >}}
No Filipino shall establish laws on primogeniture, nor institutions restrictive of property rights.. without the consent of the Government

{{< /q >}}


### 3. Federalism (Self-control)

The Philippines currently has a unitary form of government because it followed administrative system established by the Spanish. The problem is that Maharlika was originally a confederation and without a single ruler. This is because **it is made up of many small islands and not a single land mass**.  

{{< q >}}
The Visayan settlements are along the coast are not connected by common jurisdiction. They are all independent.
<cite>Chau Ju Kua, Chun Fan Chi Simplified</cite>
{{< /q >}}

<!--  [12th century Pre-colonial Philippines] -->

A unitary government on such a land will lead to feudalism wherein the local governments act like vassals of imperial Manila (the capital of Maharlika). An example is how warlords were [allowed by the president to keep private armies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11139653). 

{{< q >}}
In 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private "armies" being kept by families like the Ampatuans.. legitimising their use as a means of local control.
<cite>BBC News</cite>
{{< /q >}}



This contributes to rent-seeking and low productivity since the people are under a leader that owes his rule to Manila instead of the locals.

Maharlikanism suggests a [federation of 27 states](/maharlika/governance/federalism) that will spur and maximize the productivity of the people. 

The federal government will then be in charge of semi-state owned corporations that will build dams, power generation, and transportation infrastructure for the states. This is because large inftrastructure often crosses state lines.  
- For example, each province should have its own powerplant run by the federal government with 10-90 to 30-70 equity split, with the larger belonging to investors who will provide the equipment and expertise. This will replace the centralized baseload configuration of the energy sector into a more diversified and independent one that can use solar, wind, geothermal, or hydro.   
- In this way, only excess capacity will be routed to the centralized Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM). In effect, this will reduce the impact of EPIRA and the influence of market forces (money) on the basic right to electricity.
<!-- - Households and businesses can use their own solar power in the daytime and switch to the grid at night. This will remove the need for local batteries. -->


###  4. Bicameral Parliament (Respect)

The current political system has the president and vice president elected by popular vote. Such a system favors popular people instead of skilled ones.

To solve this, we propose a [modified parliamentary system](/research/hume/essays/part-2/16) where:
- the people elect local representatives
- those representatives elect 27 senators, as well as parliamentarians for the National Assembly
- those senators choose a president and a vice president from among themselves

In this way, the representatives and senators can choose from themselves who would have the actual skills to lead the country.

{{< q a="hume" >}}
The  representatives will have all the legislative power. The votes on legislation will be decided by the majority. If these are equal, the senate will vote on it.
<cite>David Hume, Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth</cite>
{{< /q >}}



### 5. Barter Trade (Cooperation-Bayanihan)

<!-- The Chinese traders respected the barter economy of Maharlika for its fidelity.    -->

The federalized system will be ideal for our proposed bayanihan barter economy which is based on [points as a store of value](/social/economics/solutions/bur/).

A point is pegged to 1 kilogram of NFA rice. This will implement Adam Smith's [grain-based valuation](/social/economics/principles/effort-theory-of-value). This is superior to cryptocurrency and which is pegged to nothing. In fact, the chronic inflation from 2020 is caused by crypto*.


> *Instead of people putting their money in the bank which the bank can lend to producers, they put their money into crypto which produces nothing and even wastes electricity. This waste and lack of production contributes to inflation. 



A grain-based system will make the economy secure from inflation and financial crises, which we predict to happen in a few years. This system give importance to agriculture and will be the basis of the Maharlikan cooperative system.

<!-- This makes it a kind of delayed barter system that is based on morals instead of money, specifically pakikipagkapwa. This would make entrepreneurship cheaper since morals (trust, integrity, honesty) are free yet very expensive. --> 

According to [historian Chau Ju Kua](/research/chau-ju-kua/chun-fan-chi), barter was the natural commercial system in Maharlika. So far, barter is only legal in Sulu through the Mindanao Barter Council. 

{{< q >}}
The native traders will bring those goods to other islands for barter. It will take 8-9 months for them to return. They then repay the foreign merchants with what they had obtained for the goods.
<cite>Chau Ju Kua [12th century Pre-colonial Philippines]</cite>
{{< /q >}}


This federal barter system can then be extended to foreign trade. Unknown to many, the British economist EF Schumacher proposed a similar international barter system called [multilateral clearing](https://centerforneweconomics.org/publications/multilateral-clearing/) wherein all countries act as one entity in a 'pool'. His system was his alternative to:
- the currency union of the EU
- the world trade system which uses the US Dollar as an international reserve currency.

In Schumacher's system, the exports of Country A to Country B is paid for by the fund of Country A. This fund is replenished or paid back by exports to Country A. In this way, foreign trade becomes local trade, making trade wars obsolete. It will also help countries in the pool to industrialize or 'agriculturalize' faster. 



{{< q a="EF-Schumacher" >}}
Compared to free international convertibility of currencies, Pool Clearing offers one outstanding advantage: its inner mechanism overcomes temporary disequilibrium situations in international exchange by expansion instead of restriction.

The Philippines can implement multilateral clearing **to export its way to pay the Covid-19 debts** through the export of bananas, coconuts, and services. This will allow the government to free up its budget so that it can have money to incubate industry and continue the industrialization policies of Magsaysay and Garcia.

### 6. Open Education Policy (Intellect)

<!--  Science and Math -->

<!-- Because of a mental staticity, Filipinos easily get into debt.
- On a national level, this is seen as the huge debts of the Marcos and Duterte administrations
- On a common level, this is seen in farmers getting into debt from loansharks 

The debt is an effect of the lack of algebra ability. 

People get tempted by having instant money now that is paid in small amounts over a long period. So they take the loan without making any fundamental changes to their circumstances due to a weak knowledge of the sciences. This leads to a loss which they have to pay with another debt, causing debt slavery.

The West, Chinese, and Indians, on the other hand, have a culture of math. This allows them to be creditors. and feed off  the ignorance of people. This eventually leads On a national scale, this leads to debt traps where poor countries sell their lands and resources to foreign creditors. -->

<!-- Advanced foreign cultures  can only be pushed by inviiting foregn educational system to establish themselves in Maharlika.  
Removing the constitution -->


The real advancement of the US, Europe, and Singapore comes from the multicultural, harmonious nature of their society. This diversity gives their people a wide range of cognitive experiences which builds diverse pathways in their brain, allowing them a wider range of ideas and mental processes. 

This is embodied by the Romans who learned of different technologies from the tribes that they conquered. Likewise, the Meiji Japanese learned by sending their intellectuals to the West to learn modern ways.

This is very different from Philippine mentality where students only want to graduate just to get it over with. 

This Maharlikan policy calls for a repeal of Article 14 Section 4 Item 2 which is biased towards schools owned by religions. This repeal is consistent with the Open Religious Policy by adding schools, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Islamic, and Hindu, that are not based on Western religion or culture.

{{< q >}}
Educational institutions, other than those established by religious groups and mission boards, shall be owned solely by citizens of the Philippines or corporations or associations at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by such citizens.
<cite>1987 Constitution</cite>
{{< /q >}}


**The purpose is for the growth of intellect, culture, and employment.**

For example, a Japanese school might set up a Philippine branch to bring elementary Japanese education to Filipinos who can eventually work in Japan armed with the proper language and cultural skills. The same is true for those who want to work in the Middle East, Hongkong, Singapore, etc.

Such schools can be subsidized by their governments. In this way, **those countries share in the burden of educating the less-educated**. This leads to mutual benefit by raising the quality of OFWs. 

Moreover, those students can add foreign ideas and skills to enrich the Maharlikan pool of talent. This will spur innovation which will then invite foreign capital naturally. This will also lead to hybrid cultures, food, music, arts, which can be used for tourism. 

At the moment, the Philippines only has Western ideas and systems as a consequence of Spanish and American colonization. 

<!-- A mad push for Science and Math is therefore essential to stop the loss of both economic and territorial sovereignty. Science can even be enshrined as its own religion: -->

<!-- - Hierarchy is detremined by the number of degrees, Masters or Doctorates, as is done in the West, China, and Korea -->
<!-- - Math Olympics and Quiz Bees would be given the same importance as the Olympics and Asian Games
- The goal would not be just to graduate from university, but to graduate with the highest honors
- "Smart-shaming" would be replaced by "Stupid-shaming" -->
<!-- - The language of communication is made up of mathematical equation. 
- It discriminates against stupidity, superstition, and myths -->
<!-- , just as bigot Christians discriminate against Muslims and other religions -->

<!-- This goes hand in hand with the open religious policy.  -->

{{< q a="smith">}}
The state should make the study of science and philosophy universal
<cite>Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter 1</cite>
{{< /q >}}


### 7. No Minimum Wage and Contractualization (Hard work)

Contractualization is the effect of minimum wage. 

To meet the high minimum wages, businesses reduce the benefits, leading to contractualization. This is because **there is not much productivity in the economy** to pay for both wages and benefits.

This low productivity is in turn is caused by overpopulation:
- Instead of one child getting money for tuition in a good school, having many children splits up the tuition as to afford only inferior schools, or even no education for the other children 
- Instead of 100,000 workers using a train meant for 100,000 passengers to get to their workplace on time, a population of 400,000 will cause a congestion in transportation, causing a delay for all of them, reducing their productivity.  

This overpopulation is caused by the Roman Catholic system*. The Philippine ban on population control leads to an oversupply of Filipinos which lowers productivity and makes them cheap. This causes them to move overseas as cheap labor, called Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). 


{{< q a="mont" >}}

### 8.  Tree-Planting Employment (Environmentalism)

Lastly, the environment should be enshrined because it is the most cost effective protection against global warming and natural disasters. 

Currently, Western countries advocate massive spending on green energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such a solution really favors the finaciers and engineering companies who will prosper at the expense of taxpayers. 

A more sustainable solution is to [use trees themselves to reduce greenhouse gases](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/planting-trees-helps-fight-climate-change-but-we-need-billions-more-seedlings). Trees work for free and can maintain themselves after some time. 

The government can barter food and other non-monetary items in exchange for the labor for tree-planting and maintenance (such as mangroves in coastal areas). This will:
- drive employment while providing welfare, as an alternative to ayuda and univesal basic income 
- enrich the soil naturally
- prevent erosion and floods
- raise land values


{{< q a="hume" >}}
Strabo says that the northern parts of Spain are ill inhabited because of the great cold. This means that Europe is become warmer than before.

Our northern colonies in America become more temperate as the woods are felled.

## How It Can Be Implemeted in 5 Phases

The plan can be implemented in phases, just like what we suggested for [Afghanistan](/social/cycles/afghanistan) 


Phase: Year | Policy 
--- | ---
Phase 1: 2022-2027 | Dual-citizenship is abolished to get revenue to capitalize semi-state-run utilities. Open religion, math-science advocacy, tree-planting are begun
Phase 2: 2028-2033 | Constitution is changed to Maharlika, Parliamentary, and Federalism. Minimum Wage and Contractualization are abolished. Barter trade and barter taxation are legalized in a few places. Foreign investment in education can begin
Phase 3: 2034-2039 | Barter taxation is expanded between states and used to reforest far flung areas
Phase 4: 2040-2045 | The multicultural education system starts to drive innovation. Barter is expanded overseas. Manila becomes the headquarters of a World Barter Organization
Phase 5: 2046-2051 | Advanced industries like space travel can commence


By 2052, the problems of the Philippines will be finished and Maharlika will have arrived as an industrialized country or at least be closer to such a goal.


---------------

DUTERTENOMICS

During his presidential campaign Duterte promised to give a comfortable life to the poor. However, the unstoppable rising prices* from 2020 directly contradict this promise since it makes life less comfortable.

> *This inflation can be most easily reduced by a global ban on cryptocurreny mining and NFTs as explained [here](/social/economics/solutions/2020-inflation) 



To see where the contradiction occurs, let's dissect Dutertenomics. Its most prominent parts are:

- Build Build Build
- TRAIN Law (This is higher taxation used to pay for Build Build Build)
- Ease of business
- Land Distribution
- Continuation of *Pantawid Pamilya* of Noynoy Aquino

These policies are consistent with the Keynesian doctrine, except for "Pantawid Pamilya" which is Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), a modified version of Universal Basic Income (UBI) implemented by former President Noynoy Aquino.

CCT is a neoliberal policy* that [helps development banks](/social/economics/solutions/how-to-solve-inequality) such as the World Bank by giving employment to the bank's consultants and its money. 

> *The non-neoliberal, non-liberal financial way of poverty alleviation is called microfinance. The conservative way is welfare either by the state via social security or by religion via thites or forced donations.


Likewise, tech startups lobby for UBI to give employment to themselves via blockchain and other fancy new technologies, even if there might be no added benefit for the poor.  


<!-- *. This is proven by his original 10-point plan, as Dutertenomics. 

> *Hugo Chavez also implemented pro-poor policies which slowly drained away Venezuela's wealth until everyone became poor. For the Philippines, the huge 11 trillion peso debt certainly look like the first steps towards a similar destiny 
 -->
<!-- - allowing overseas Filipino workers to return in 2020 during the pandemic
  - This increased the Covid outbreak which crashed the economy. In contrast, Vietnam banned its own citizens from returning and was able to be Covid free in 2020
- the other policies of NEDA -->

<!-- Thus, Pantawid Pamilya is the first sign of policy inconsistency. Brazil's version is *Bolsa Familia* which was discontinued after it was proven that it had little effect on alleviating poverty.  -->

The original Dutertenomics itself is quite limited, so it also absorbed the NEDA* plan called **Ambisyon Natin 2040**. It was created by Arsenio Balisacan of the neoliberal Philippine Competition Commission during Noynoy Aquino's administration.

> *NEDA is the economic planning agency of the Philippine government. Ambisyon Natin 2040 is split into chunks called Philippine Development Plans, similar to Communist Five-Year Plans. The first plan is for 2017-2022. The next one is for 2023-2028.



## [Ambisyon Natin 2040](https://2040.neda.gov.ph/about-ambisyon-natin-2040): Neoliberalism Under the Guise of Socialism

This policy was formulated by interviewing 10,000 people around the nation, asking them what they and the country should achieve by 2040. Since the country is poor, then of course we can expect that the answers will reflect the shallow desires of poor people:
- 79% want a comfortable life
- 17% want a an affluent life

<!-- 'Comfortable life' is then defined as having:
- a medium-sized home (61%)
- a car (59%)
- college education (73%)
- local vacation (84%)
-->

It revealed that the uneducated wanted to study: <!-- An alarming trend is the national preference of subjects to study, with --> 
- teaching*
- business administration
- tourism
- law

> *Venezuela also spent a lot on teaching and social welfare through their Bolivarian programs, but is now dirt-poor. This is because we blindly expect teachers to teach the right things, not thinking that they could also teach the wrong things as well. 

<!-- This teaching of wrong things probably helped Maduro retain power, since governance and subordination are all based on opinion.  -->

Unfortunately, these subjects also lead to low-value services and employment (in red). Few people want to study the difficult subjects that lead to high value employment (in green).

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/neda2.jpg" alt="NEDA" >}}


Also alarming is the preference for cars over public transport such as buses and trains.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/nedatrain.jpg" alt="NEDA Train" >}}



NEDA then built policies around this data:

- It added more road projects under the Build, Build, Build program instead of creating a proper state-owned bus system (NEDA, as a neoliberal agency, might never allow anything state-owned)
- It emphasized tourism and hospitality
<!-- - shortened business registration -->
- It ignored support for medical training and beefing up the healthcare system. Instead, it focused on the financial aspect of healthcare as health insurance through the Universal Healthcare Law<!--  which will drain the budget of 257 billion pesos --> <!-- which will need to be borrowed (utang) --><!-- this is probably from the 2010 nursing problem -->
- It focused on rice tariffication to allow imports <!-- while building up rice production --> in the guise of lowering food prices to benefit the poor. This is classic neoliberalism

As expected, these **backfired** when the unexpected pandemic hit:

- The lockdowns prevented people from travelling and from using the new roads from Build Build Build
- Tourism collapsed<!-- , rendering the public investment in it useless -->
<!-- - a lot of businesses closed down -->
- The lack of support for medical training led to a shortage of nurses, which made universal healthcare act irrelevant
- Rice tariffication led to agircultural imports that did not reduce rice prices, but instead destroyed local agriculture <!-- which created anomalies in rice supply -->
<!-- - , leading to the current high food prices -->


## The NEDA Flaw: A Reverse Kind of Survivorship Bias

The glaring error with the NEDA plan was that **it created economic policy from interviews with the people**. The problem is that a poor country like the Philippines will likely be full of poor people. **If you ask poor people what they want, then they will give answers that will propagate the same poverty**.

NEDA's mistake is a kind of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)*.


{{< img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Survivorship-bias.svg/220px-Survivorship-bias.svg.png" >}}


> *Researchers in the UK in World War 2 observed that the returning British bombers had parts of their wings missing. The Americans wrongly advised that armor should be added to those parts. But Hungarian mathematician Abraham Wald argued the opposite, that armor should be added to the non-missing wing parts. The Americans were looking at the effect, while Wald was looking at the cause. 


An easy proof of this bias is the national preference for subjects like teaching, lawyering, tourism, and business administration that lead to low value jobs. Are Germany, Japan, South Korea known for their teachers, lawyers, tourism, or accountants? No. They're known for their advanced manfuacturing as Siemens, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi.

> *Tito Sotto is correct in saying that the country already has too many lawyers. Yet, public policy does nothing to discourage law schools or to make the bar exam more selective and restrictive <!--  the NEDA interview says that more people want to be lawyers than nurses. This is because nursing is hard work and low pay, while lawyering is easier. --> 


Another proof is the preference for cars over public transport. Did Japan, France, and Singapore solve their public transportation by allowing cars as a public policy? No. In fact, they had the opposite policy which oppressed car owners with high taxes and built subways and *shinkansen* instead of freeways. 

**By implementing policies that are OPPOSITE of what poor people want, the Japanese, Singaporeans, French, and Germans are actually able to have a more COMFORTABLE life.** 

**By implementing policies the poor people want, Venezuela and Brazil put themselves into POVERTY.** 


## More Proof of Ignorance of Policymakers

NEDA policy builds a lot of roads to address the demand for cars. They never think that if their policy succeeds then more people will actually own cars. **These cars will then flood the new roads to create new traffic jams!** 

<!-- and there will be traffic again -- all the huge debt for Build Build Build would have been for little gain --><!--  led to the same problem.  -->

If policymakers just let people have their way, then the nation will degenerate quickly with everyone buying cars, flocking to easy jobs, and no one* doing the difficult or low-paying ones. 

> *This is seen in the lack of local vaccine manufacturing, simply because only a few people ever wanted to study virology <!-- and have been brained drained -->
<!-- no one  -->

 <!-- Build Build Build construction projects being done by Chinese contractors instead of local ones, simply because few locals took the time and effort to learn new construction techniques, or have been brain-drained away -->

If everyone wants to be a singer, boxer, or online seller, then who will plant crops, build the power plants, do the medical services, or create vaccines?

If few people plant crops, build power plants, hospitals, and vaccines, then those goods and services will have a shortage.

If there is a shortage then their prices rise and there will be more Pharmally-style importation<!--  like  wherein foreigners use taxpayer money to buy Lamborghinis -->. 

If their prices rise then life would not be comfortable, violating the very goal of the policy.


Thus, **Ambisyon Natin 2040 naturally goes against itself**


Proof of this is **the collapse of the economy in 2020** which NEDA says is expected to recover only after 10 long years. They blame the pandemic instead of themselves. This is absurd since the economy of other countries are not so badly affected. Even poor Cuba, heavily embargoed by the US, is able to make Covid vaccines simply because the government encouraged more people to study difficult subjects.  

<!-- The only solution of NEDA and the Department of Finance is to borrow money -- **the same measure that Marcos took to fix the flawed policies of Virata and Ongpin**! -->

Ambisyon 2040 is still consistent with our earlier observation that [local policymakers, whether liberal 'dilawan' or nationalist 'loyalista', are ignorant of cause and effect](/maharlika/history/golden-years-marcos). This ignorance seemed to begin in the early 1960s after the presidency of Magsaysay* and Garcia who still had the right policies. 

> *Magsaysay for example fought against the pro-American Bell Trade act,  whereas Macapagal blindly accepted the pro-American decontrol policy of 1962. The decontrol destroyed local industrialization and allowed the country to get in debt with the IMF -- a practice carried to perfection by Marcos and Latin American dictators 

<!-- , even among the educated Virata, Ongpin, Purisima, Dominguez, Pernia, and Chua then lead to the wrong policies which then cause the country to stay largely poor from 1974 to 2021. -->

<!-- Just ask anyone if they are comfortable -->



## Evil Rice Tariffication

The Rice Tariffication Law is the single biggest mistake of the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 of Ambisyon Natin. It began with the rice crisis of September 2018 as the rapid increase in the prices of rice. But this was a natural consequence of the increased taxes from the TRAIN tax reform which was supported by NEDA itself.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/farmer.jpg" alt="A farmer" >}}



Instead of strengthening NFA* to deal with the crisis, the Senate and Lower House actually destroyed it through the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) in order to allow rice importation. 

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/wtf.png" alt="nfa wtf" >}}

> *NFA is the National Food Authority which is the government agency that buys and stores rice 

The Masterminds of RTL were familiar names: 
- Cynthia Villar
- Grace Poe
- Joel Villanueva
- Jose Panganiban
- Kiko Pangilinan
- Leila de Lima
- Ralph Recto
- Risa Hontiveros
- Sharon Garin 
- Win Gatchalian
- [Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/economy/685184/arroyo-welcomes-signing-of-rice-tariffication-law/story/)
<!-- - Tomas Villarin
- Horacio Suansing Jr
- Estrellita Suansing -->

<!-- Had Duterte dropped Duque during the pandemic, his approval ratings would not have dipped in 2020 and 2021. Duterte's unnecessary reliance on Arroyo is proof of her genius
 -->


The lawmakers thought, that by removing quotas and imposing a tiny 35% tariff that went to local farmers, local rice production would increase as to reduce the price of rice. 

In reality, the warehouses didn't bother buying from scattered local producers* and instead bought in bulk from a single importer, gaining from economies of scale. Without buyers for local rice, the local farmers had a glut of unsold rice. <!-- were already full of foreign rice and so the local rice could not be sold.  -->This is similar to local carrots not finding a market because the market was already occupied by Chinese carrots which could be bought by warehouses easily in bulk.


> *The error of the proponent of RTL was to apply [equilibrium theory (1.5 mb pdf)](https://www.phcc.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Issues-Paper-Rice-030819-cover-1.pdf) on a basic seasonal necessity such as rice. This is the same error that liberalized California's power industry as the energy spot-market, that led to their energy crisis. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo imported this scheme to create EPIRA that regularly brings power outages and price spikes.



Didn't the lawmakers know that the secret to rice and agricultural self-sufficiency is for the government to control all parts of the chain from production, transportation, milling, warehousing, wholesaling, and even exporting? 

Didn't they know that this is what Vietnam does with state-owned Vinafood which allows them to export rice cheaply to the world?

<!-- Didn't they know that the Philippines is among the largest rice importers in the world, and is Vietnam's biggest customer?  -->

Didn't they know that Marcos replicated this with the NFA (milling), Food Terminal Inc as FTI (storage), and Kadiwa stores (retail) which allowed the country to export rice in the past?


## The Problem with Neoliberal Keynesianism

These problems are really rooted in the flawed assumptions of Keynesianism which spread after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Because of the doctrine of profit maximization, the burden of driving growth fell to the government which had to build huge projects, get debt, then raise taxes to pay for that debt. 

In the case of Dutertenomics, TRAIN and food importation (Rice Tarrification) was used to pay for Build Build Build. It oppresses consumers and farmers to support the construction industry. It is not a growth that is inclusive nor balanced.


Our social cycles model predicts that the pandemic will last a long time, yet NEDA and lawmakers are still acting like the old normal. They have not scrapped their old neoliberal ways and still think that market forces will somehow relieve the people of their suffering.

Market forces cannot solve the current economic problems of the Philippines because such forces are based on **selfish-interest**, while the alleviation of the suffering of others is a **selfless-interest**. *A person, policy, or system cannot be selfish and selfless at the same time!*

Pharmally was able to buy Lamborghinis simply because it used the market forces of supply, demand, and financing to its private advantage, at the expense of a huge public debt which has to be paid by future generations. 

In fact, the pandemic has proven that nationalized basics* via semi-state-owned corporations are the way of the future, as proven by China and Singapore**. 

> *Healthcare, Power, Water, Telecoms, Public transportation

> **Singapore has the best healthcare in the world, with 80% of its people using government-owned hospitals, and the rest using private hospitals like Raffles Medical

Only the close coordination of various essential services can create a society strong enough to weather the shocks from global warming caused by the selfish <!-- winner-take-all --> behavior of market forces. This close coordination can only be done by the government which is supposed to have the public interest.

Our next post will explain how to implement this solution and overhaul Ambisyon 2040 into Maharlika 2050.   

<!-- Didn't they know that expensive infrastructure projects are only justified if  -->



<!-- Why did Duterte not veto this bill? Could it be because it was actually supported by his own NEDA which is infested with neoliberals?  -->

<!-- Why didn't he just use his military to arrest the smugglers and cartels citing economic sabotage? --> 

<!-- Could it be because he was ignorant of food policy in the same way that he was ignorant about Covid response and so he had to rely on 'health experts' such as the IATF which had flip-flopping policies*? -->

<!-- > *Miriam Defensor-Santiago filed Senate Bill 1573 "Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepareness Act" on September 5, 2013 but was ignored by the same despicable senate that made the Rice Tariffication Law -->



<!-- ## The Pandemic Will Make Neoliberalism Obsolete Eventually

The people **should avoid voting for those people who created the Rice Tariffication Law**. A quick workaround would be to:
- raise the tariffs to 700% like what Japan does, instead of the current 35% or 100%. Adam smith would call this 'taxation to the point of prohibition'
- use the tax revenue to rebuild NFA, FTI, and Kadiwa into a state-owned corporation directly under the executive or as an independent consitutional body
- remove neoliberals from policymaking that involves basic essentials. This would be more realistic if the NFA were a separate constitional body like the Comelec -->

<!-- Duterte won by landslide in 2016 thanks to his anti-drug and anti-corruption campaign. He promised to get rid of drugs and corruption in a few months, not knowing that [the country's metaphysics](/articles/metaphysics) actually caused those problems naturally.

His solution was to:
- weed out corrupt government officials by firing them, and
- eliminate the drug trade by killing the drug dealers and drug lords. 

These are shallow solutions that focus on the effect instead of the cause. Duterte never thought that:
- the corruption was created by the morals of American materialism which ascribed goodness to riches
- the drug trade was created by the desire for drugs which was encouraged by American liberalism

Proof is that during the Spanish times, the problem was only corruption, through the friars, (from the Spanish and the Church) and not drugs. This is because the Spanish imposed Catholic morals which empowered the Church, but went against drugs. South America was colonized by both Spain and America (Bay of Pigs, Nicaraguan Contras) and also have a corruption and drug problem much worse than the Philippines.

### Police Empowerment Without a Parallel Enforcement of Morality

Policies that only deal with effects, and not the cause, will require constant work by law enforcement. It would be like a boat with a leaky hull that is solved by scooping out the water instead of plugging the leaks. This explains why Duterte has to raise the salaries of the police and military to keep them working on the drug problem. 

The Roman Empire also did the same thing by raising the salaries of centurions and the Pretorian guards. This led to constant coups whenever the emperors couldn't raise them any longer. In fact, Rome had a year where they switched between five emperors! 

Liberals properly fear this and is why they are going against the anti-terror bill, as well as the empowerment given to the police and military. This fear is justified by the abuses of the police who kill people arbitrarily, such as the one who shot and killed a mother and her son on video in broad daylight. 

The only solution of Duterte is to blame those erring policemen as 'defects' of the Police Academy. At the moment, it is only Duterte's iron will that keeps the military and police from going back to their old corrupt ways*.

> *Crime and abuse are ultimately moral issues, to which our solution is a set of Constitutional Virtues. Britain also had a similar case wherein a police officer raped and killed a woman. This is proof that such a moral problem exists in rich and poor countries alike. 

After Duterte is gone, who will check an empowered military and police elite? -->

Symptoms: Caya mahahalata nang tauo na malapit na siyang magcasaquit, cun hindi siya malicsi, o masipag na para nang dati, cun nananabang nang pagcain: cun masaquit saquit ang sicmora, cun maraling mapagod, o cun mabigat ang caniyang olo…

(If a person feels that he will get sick, or if he becomes weak or loses enthusiasm, or if he loses appetite: if he gets a stomach ache, fatigue, or gets a heavy feeling in the head…)

Remedy: Capag ganoon ang damdam, ang gagauin niya’y houag titiquim siya nang carne, sabao, o itlog, o alac. Houag siyang magsasaquit gumaua: inomin niya ang bilin sa numero 1, o, 2, ga dalaua o tatlong botella carami maghapon; Cun aayao siya doo’y uminong nang tubig na malacoco na hohologan nang caonting suca. Cun walang suca, ang dalawang botellang tubig na malacoco ay doonan nang caonting asin at yaon ay inomin. Cun baga may roong polot ay mabuting laguian ang tubig nang tatlo o apat na cuchara noon.

Passages: Sulu, An Introduction

(If a person feels any of the symptoms, he must abstain from consuming meat, soup, egg, or alcohol. He must refrain from work. He must drink one or two bottles throughout the afternoon. If he does not like that, he must drink hot water [malacoco] mixed with little vinegar. If there is no vinegar, he must drink two bottles of hot water with a little salt. If honey is available, add three or four spoons of honey into the mix.)

Symptoms: Cun minsan namamaga yaong dalauang galandulas o bocol na naroon sa piling nang tayinga’t sibang, cun minsan yaong dalaua naming hinihipo sa ilalim nang gitna nang sihang, na galandulas din yaon.

(If the two lumps below the ears become swollen or inflamed)

Remedy: Itong saquit na ito ay nauauala pagca pinahiran nang tayom na tinunao sa caunting suca.

(This ailment disappears if you dissolve sea urchin in vinegar and apply it on the sore areas.) 

3|  Ang gagaouin sa manga quinagat nang asong olol cun walang mercurio o asogue
(What to do when a person is bitten by a rabid dog and there is no mercury available)


PHOTO BY MARIO ALVARO LIMOS.
Remedy: Datapoa cun walang mercurio at maliuag naming magpacoha ca sa Maynila, ang gagauin sa quinagat nang asong bang-ao ay gay-on. Pagcaraca huhugasa’t lilinisan ang sugat nang may-saquit nang tubig na malacoco na dinoonan nang asin, nang macoha ang lauay nang asong naca cagat. Saca painomin toloy ang may-saquit nang lana o langis sa castila o langis ng niyog na mabaho man, ga calahating taza carami hanggang siya’y sumuca. Itong pag-inom nang langis, hindi sucat pabayaan, ay siya ang caonaonahang gamut dito.

Saca cun ibig at pumapayag ang may-saquit, ang sugat ay pasoin nang caonting bulac o nang laman ng bonga nang boboy.

(If there is no mercury and it is impractical to procure one from Manila, this is what you should do to a person bitten by a rabid dog. Wash and clean the wound with hot water mixed with salt in order to expel the dog’s saliva from the wound. Make the patient drink half a cup of coconut oil, even though it has a strong aroma until he vomits.

If the patient permits, apply hot cotton on the wound or apply bee sting on the wound. If the patient does not like those treatments, another remedy is cutting the wound with a blade to let it bleed. After it bleeds, apply a deer’s burnt antlers on the wound and don’t remove until it falls off.)

4|  Gamot sa quinagat nang Poquiotan, Laiwan, Potacti, Amboboyog, Lamoc, o Langao na may camandag
(Remedy for bites coming from bees, wasps, mosquitos, and venomous flies)

Cun mayroong quinagat na tauo niyong manga hayop na yaon, ang gagauin ay gayon.

Ang lana o langis ng niog o langis sa castila, cun ilahir agad sa lugar nang quinagatan nang hayop ay nacacauala nang pamamaga, pati nang pagsaquit. Datapoa, cun minsan, hindi cailangan gumaua nang anoman doon sa quinagat niyong manga hayop na yaon, at ang saquit siyang cusang nauauala.

Cun baga maraming hayop ang nacacagat, ay sangralan, o conan nang dugo ang may catauan.

(If a person is stung by any of these insects, this is what you should do. Remove the stinger using a needle. Apply a damp towel on the affected area. The towel may be soaked in a solution of boiled flowers from the alagao plant. You may also put bread that is soaked in milk and honey. Wash the patient with warm water up to the knees and don’t feed him so much at night. Let him drink the boiled water from the alagao plant.

You may apply coconut oil on the affected area to prevent inflammation and ease pain. Sometimes, a person bitten by these insects may not need medical attention at all. But if he is bitten by a lot of insects, perform bloodletting.)
