Chap 1: Works on Natural Jurisprudence
Jurisprudence is the science that inquires into the general principles of the laws of all nations.
Hugo Grotius
Hugo Grotius was the first to give the world a regular system of natural jurisprudence.
His On the Laws of War and Peace, with all its imperfections, is perhaps the most complete work on jurisprudence to this day.
It is a sort of casuistical book for sovereigns and states.
It determines in what cases:
war may justly be made, and
how far war may be carried on.
States have no common sovereign.
They are with respect to one another in a state of nature [Hume, Book 3, Treatise].
War is their only method of redressing injuries.
He determines war to be lawful when the state receives an injury which would be redressed by an equitable civil magistrate.
This naturally led him to inquire into:
the constitution of states and the principles of civil laws,
the rights of sovereigns and subjects,
the nature of crimes, contracts, property, and
whatever else was the object of law.
Books 1 & 2 of Grotius' treatise are a complete system of jurisprudence.
Mr. Hobbes was the next writer of note after Grotius.
He hated the Church.
The bigotry of his times led him to think that the Church's dominance on men's consciences caused the dissensions and civil wars in England during the times of Charles I and Cromwell.
He tried to establish a moral system:
where men's consciences would be subjected to the civil power, and
which represented the magistrate's will as the only proper rule of conduct.
He says that before society's establishment, mankind was in a state of war.
To avoid the ills of a natural state, men entered into contract to obey one common sovereign who should determine all disputes.
Obedience to his will constituted civil government.
Without obedience, there could be no virtue.
Consequently it too was the foundation and essence of virtue.
The divines thought themselves obliged to oppose this pernicious doctrine concerning virtue.
They attacked it by showing that a state of nature was not a state of war, but that society might subsist without civil institutions, though not so harmoniously.
They tried to show that man in this state has certain rights such as:
a right to his body
the fruits of his labour, and
the fulfillment of contracts.
Samuel von Puffendorf
Samuel von Puffendorf wrote his large treatise with this design.
The sole intention of its first part is to confute Hobbes.
Though in reality it only treats of the laws in a state of nature, or by what means succession to property was carried on, as there is no such state existing.
The next who wrote on this subject was the Baron de Cocceii, a Prussian.
His works have five volumes.
Many of them are very ingenious and distinct, especially those about laws.
In the last volume, he gives an account of some German systems.
Besides these, there are no other notable systems on jurisprudence.


Chap. 2: the Division of the Subject
Jurisprudence is the theory of the general principles of law and government.
The four great objects of law are:
justice
police
revenue, and
arms.
The object of justice is the security from injury.
It is the foundation of civil government.
The objects of police are:
the cheapness of commodities,
public security and
cleanliness, if the two last were not too minute for a lecture of this kind.
Under this head we will consider the opulence of a state.
The magistrate who spends his time and labour in the state's business should be compensated for it.
Some fund must be raised for defraying government expenses.
Hence the origin of revenue.
The levying of revenue, [4] which must come from the people by taxes, duties, etc.
In general, the most insensible way of raising of revenue from the people should be preferred.




The best police cannot give security unless the government can defend themselves from foreign injuries and attacks.
This is the fourth thing appointed by law.
Under this are:
the different kinds of arms with their advantages and disadvantages
the constitution of standing armies, militias, etc.




After these will be considered the laws of nations, under which are comprehended:
the demands which one independent society may have upon another,
the privileges of aliens, and
proper grounds for making war.
