Through the intervention of Tsz-Lu, Tsz-kau was being appointed governor of Pi. 

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
You are spoiling a good man's son
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
But he will have the people and their superiors to gain experience from, and there will be the altars; what need to read books? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
He can become a student afterwards. This is why I hate glib-tongued people 
{{< /l >}}

Tsz-Lu, Tsang Sin, Yen Yu, and Kung-si Hwa were sitting near him. He said to them:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Though I may be a day older than you, do not (for the moment) regard me as such. While you are living this unoccupied life you are saying, 'We do not become known.' Now suppose some one got to know you, what then?"
{{< /l >}}

Tsz-Lu was first to speak:

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
If a state were large, had many armaments, hemmed in and hampered by other larger States causing a dearth, I could take charge of that state and turn it into a brave and respected country in 3 years.
<!-- - had a population augmented by armies and regiments, causing a dearth in it of food of all kinds -->
{{< /r >}}


The Master smiled at him, then asked the same question to Yen.

{{< r a="Yen-Yu" >}}
I can make such a country, with an area of 60 li square, prosperous in 3 years. As regards their knowledge of ceremonial or music, I should wait for superior men to teach them that.
{{< /r >}}

He then asked Kung-si.

{{< r a="Kung-Si" >}}
I have nothing to say about my capabilities for such matters. My wish is to learn.  

I would like to be a junior assistant, in dark robe and cap, at the services of the ancestral temple, and at the Grand Receptions of the Princes by the Sovereign.
{{< /r >}}

He then asked Tsang Sin who was strumming on his harpsichord, but now the twanging ceased, he turned from the instrument, rose to his feet, and answered:

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
Something different from the choice of these 3.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
I want each one of you to tell me what his heart is set upon.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
Well then, give me in the latter part of spring dressed in full spring-tide attire�in company with five or six young fellows of 20*, or six or seven lads under that age, to do the ablutions in the I stream, enjoy a breeze in the rain-dance**,  and finish up with songs on the road home.
{{< /r >}}

> *Lit., capped ones. At 20 they underwent the ceremony of capping, and were considered men.

> **I.e., before the altars, where offerings were placed with prayer for rain. A religious dance.] 


The Master sighed and exclaimed, "Ah, I take with you!"

The 3 other disciples went out, leaving Tsang Sin behind

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
What think you of the answers of those three?" 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Well, each told me what was uppermost in his mind. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
Why did you smile at Tsz-Lu, sir?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Leading a State requires due regard to the Rules of Propriety. His words showed a lack of modesty.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
But Yen, then he had a State in view, had he not?" 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
I should like to be shown a territory such as he described which does not amount to a State.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsang-Sin" >}}
But had not Kung-si also a State in view?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
What are ancestral temples and Grand Receptions, but for the feudal lords to take part in? If Kung-si were to become an unimportant assistant at these functions, who could become an important one?" 
{{< /l >}}
