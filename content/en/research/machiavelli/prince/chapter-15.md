<!-- ## Chapter 15= Things For Which Men, And Especially Princes Are Praised Or Blamed -->

How should a prince deal with his subjects and friends?

<!-- And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered too bold in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall not follow the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write something which shall be useful to him who reads it, it appears to me more appropriate
to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it.  -->

<!-- Many have imagined republics and principalities which have never been seen. How one actually lives is far distant from how one ought to live.  -->


Anyone who neglects to do what should be done sooner brings about his ruin rather than his preservation. 

A man who wishes to act entirely virtuously might soon be destroyed in an evil world. <!--  among so much that is evil in the world. -->

Hence a prince who wishes to survive must know, according to necessity, how to do or not do wrong. 

<!-- Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise. -->

The chiefly princes are known for real qualities. 

Thus:
- one has the reputation of being liberal, another mean. 
- one is generous, another greedy
- one cruel, one kind
- one disloyal another faithful
- one weak and cowardly, another bold and brave
- one friendly, another proud
- one pleasure loving, another restrained
- one sincere, another not truthful
- one hard, another easy
- one serious, another foolish
- one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. <!-- nd I know that everyone will confess that it would be most worthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good. --> 


<!-- But, because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed in any one person, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to  -->

A prince:
- should be careful so that he can avoid the criticism which would lose him his state. 
<!-- - avoid bad behaviour which would not lose him his state, but, if this is not possible, he may with less hesitation do it.  -->
- should not feel uneasy about being criticised for that bad behaviour which is necessary to maintain the state. 

<!-- , because if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that  -->

Sometimes:
- virtue would lead to his ruin
- vice may bring him security and wealth.
