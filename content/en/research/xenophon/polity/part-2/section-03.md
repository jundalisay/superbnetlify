Coming to the critical period at which a boy ceases to be a boy and becomes a youth, (1) we find that it is just then that the rest of the world proceed to emancipate their children from the private tutor and the schoolmaster, and, without substituting any further ruler, are content to launch them into absolute independence.

<!--  (1) {eis to meirakiousthai}, "with reference to hobbledehoy-hood."
    Cobet erases the phrase as post-Xenophontine. -->


Here, again, Lycurgus took an entirely opposite view of the matter. 

This, if observation might be trusted, was the season when the tide of animal spirits flows fast, and the froth of insolence rises to the surface; when, too, the most violent appetites for divers pleasures, in serried ranks, invade (2) the mind. 

This, then, was the right moment at which to impose tenfold labours upon the growing youth, and to devise for him a subtle system of absorbing occupation. 

And by a crowning enactment, which said that "he who shrank from the duties imposed on him would forfeit henceforth all claim to the glorious honours of the state," he caused, not only the public authorities, but those personally interested (3) in the several companies of youths to take serious pains so that no single individual of them should by an act of craven cowardice find himself utterly rejected and reprobate within the body politic.

<!--  (2) Lit. "range themselves." For the idea, see "Mem." I. ii. 23;
    Swinburne, "Songs before Sunrise": Prelude, "Past youth where
    shoreward shallows are."

 (3) Or, "the friends and connections." -->

In his desire to implant in their youthful souls a root of modesty he imposed upon these bigger boys a special rule. 

In the very streets they were to keep their two hands (4) within the folds of the cloak; they were to walk in silence and without turning their heads to gaze, now here, now there, but rather to keep their eyes fixed upon the ground before them. And hereby it would seem to be proved conclusively that, even in the matter of quiet bearing and sobriety, (5) the masculine type may claim greater strength than that which we attribute to the nature of women. 

At any rate, you might sooner expect a stone image to find voice than one of those Spartan youths; to divert the eyes of some bronze stature were less difficult. And as to quiet bearing, no bride ever stepped in bridal bower (6) with more natural modesty. Note them when they have reached the public table. (7) The plainest answer to the question asked—that is all you need expect to hear from their lips.


<!--  (6) Longinus, {peri ups}, iv. 4, reading {ophthalmois} for     {thalamois}, says: "Yet why speak of Timaeus, when even men like     Xenophon and Plato, the very demigods of literature, though they
    had sat at the feet of Socrates, sometimes forget themselves in
    the pursuit of such pretty conceits? The former in his account of
    the Spartan Polity has these words: 'Their voice you would no more
    hear, than if they were of marble, their gaze is as immovable as
    if they were cast in bronze. You would deem them more modest than
    the very maidens in their eyes.' To speak of the pupils of the
    eyes as modest maidens was a piece of absurdity becoming
    Amphicrates rather than Xenophon; and then what a strange notion
    to suppose that modesty is always without exception, expressed in
    the eye!"—H. L. Howell, "Longinus," p. 8. See "Spectator," No.
    354.
