Word | Definition 
--- | ---
abundance | The ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it. (Money is merely one of innumerable ways to express & experience abundance.)
anxiety | The energy of excitement, but filtered through a belief in something undesirable or unpreferred.  ("Anxiety" is "Excitement" with a negative judgement.   Remove the negative judgment, and you have "Excitement". )
discernment | Discernment is selecting and acting on your preference from the available options
judgment | is going a step-further and invalidating what you do NOT prefer. The recommendation is to act according to preference, without invalidating what you do not prefer.
doubt | Doubt is not a lack of trust. It is a TOTAL TRUST in an undesirable or unpreferred reality.  You do not need to "develop" trust, since you are always 100% TOTALLY TRUSTING in SOMETHING. You only need to FOCUS your trust on a preferred reality, rather than an unpreferred one.
ego | Ego is that part of our consciousness whose job is to keep us FOCUSED on this physical incarnation. Just like binoculars allow you to see things in the distance with much more vivid detail, likewise, the ego allows you to FOCUS more clearly on what's happening in your physical incarnation. That is its ONLY job. If you give it more tasks to do (like being in control), then it gets resentment, and you end up with the negative ego.
excitement | The energy that occurs when one is in resonance with their own Higher Self.    This is a "signal" from your Higher Self (which always honors your free will) to encourage you to act or move in a particular direction. "Excitement" can therefore be used as a "compass heading" to move & act in the direction that your Higher Self hopes you will move - for your highest joy.   If you "follow your excitement" consistently, you will end up fulfilling your Life's Purpose.
failure | Giving up on achieving your Goal. As long as you do not give up on your Intention, failure has not occurred.
fear | the emotional reaction to believing in a reality (likely outcome) that you strongly do not prefer. You can use fear to your advantage, by=  1. Fully "owning" it and acknowledging that you have it. #2. Asking yourself     "What must I be believing to have this fear?" #3. Once you discover that belief, you can ACKNOWLEDGE that you have it. #4. And then REPLACE it with the opposite belief, at which point the fear quickly dissipates.
forgiveness | Forgiveness is not an "action". It is the cessation or stopping of the continuous action of continuously blaming someone for something.  Since blaming requires energy, and forgiveness is the stopping of this action of blaming, it actually is easier to forgive, than to continuously be blaming another.    So be lazy!   Forgive!
happiness | Happiness is the result of internally DECIDING to be happy - regardless of external events (as opposed to happiness being the result of desireable external events). "Happiness" also comes from following & acting on your Excitement.
hope | implies doubt. It suggests you are holding a belief that there is a significant possibility of NOT achieving your desired goal or outcome.
integrity | comes from "integer" which originates from "one". When a person realizes that "everything" is really just ONE thing, and that they are an integral part of this ONE thing, then they instinctively & automatically & spontaneously treat everyone & everything with the care, respect, love, and consideration, which which they would like to be treated.  This is "integrity".
Discernment | selecting and acting on your preference from the available options.
"Judgment | going a step-further and invalidating what you do NOT prefer. The recommendation is to select & act according to preference, without invalidating what you do not prefer. negative 	That which separates, segregates, or polarizes. (as opposed to "positive", which unifies & integrates)
positive | That which unifies, and integrates, and creates oneness. (as opposed to "negative", which creates separation)
sex | The alignment & grounding of all levels of one's being - allowing for communication with the higher levels. It is like a lightning strike that grounds & alligns all the levels, and thus allows for a clear communication to the higher levels of one's being.
synchronicity |	The manner in which the Oneness of Creation expresses {within the constraints of any time/space matrix/hologram) that=  everything is connected to everything
trust | Trust is the same as "what you believe". You are always totally trusting in something. There is never a lack of trust. So the only relevant issue is=   WHERE are you placing your trust? Accordingly, "doubt" is not a lack of trust, but a TOTAL trust in something you do not prefer.
try | "Try" implies you are keeping the back-door open for failure. The word "try" presumes you are believing there is a large possibility of NOT achieving your goal. "Trying to do" something is totally different than "doing" that something.
unconditional love | Unconditional Love is the granting of validity,  for all beings and everything to exist - just as they are.
worthiness |	The mere fact that you EXIST makes you worthy of anything you want. Your EXISTENCE and WORTHINESS are more fundamental than any beliefs you may have about them.   (They exist prior to any beliefs about them.)
