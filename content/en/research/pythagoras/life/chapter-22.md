<!-- Another mode also of erudition is transmitted to us, which was effected through Pythagoric precepts, and sentences which extended to human life and human opinions; a few of which out of many I shall narrate.  -->

Pythagoras also exhorted to <!-- Another Pythagoric erudition is an exhortation to --> remove contention and strife from true friendship, and especially from all friendship, if possible. 

But if this is not possible, at least expel it from:
- paternal friendship, and 
- universally from the friendship with elders and benefactors. 

Contending with your friends because of anger <!--  pervicaciously with such as these, anger --> or some other similar passion <!-- intervening, is not to preserve, [but --> destroys the existing friendship. 

But the smallest lacerations and ulcerations should happen in friendships. This will happen if both friends know how to yield and subdue their anger, and especially the younger of the two belonging to some one of the above-mentioned orders. 

The Pythagoreans likewise thought it necessary that:
- the corrections and admonitions which they called pædartases, and which the elder employed towards the younger, should be made with much suavity of manners and great caution
- much solicitude and appropriation should be exhibited in admonitions. In this way, the admonition will become decorous and beneficial. 

They likewise say that faith should never be separated from friendship, neither seriously nor in jest. 

For it is no longer easy for the existing friendship to remain in a sane condition, when falsehood once insinuates itself into the manners of those who assert themselves to be friends. And again they say, that friendship is not to be rejected on account of misfortune, or any other imbecility which happens to human life; but that the only laudable rejection of a friend and of friendship, is that which takes place through great and incurable vice. 

Such therefore was the form of correction with the Pythagoreans through sentences, and which extended to all the virtues, and to the whole of life.


## Chapter 23= The Pythagorean Symbols

Pythagoras saw the use of symbols in teaching as most necessary. This form of erudition was cultivated by nearly all the Greeks, as being most ancient. 

But it was transcendently honored by the Egyptians, and adopted by them in the most diversified way. 

Pythagoras conformably paid great attention to it. 

Anyone who clearly unfolds the meanings and arcane conceptions of the Pythagoric symbols will develop the great rectitude and truth they contain. <!-- , and liberate them from their enigmatic form.  -->

They are adapted according to a simple and uniform doctrine, to the great geniuses of these philosophers, and deify in a manner which surpasses human conception. 

All those who came from Pythagoras' school adopted this mode of teaching, in their discourses with each other, and in their commentaries and annotations. 

<!-- For those who , and especially the most ancient Pythagoreans, and also those young men who were the disciples of Pythagoras when he was an old man, viz. Philolaus and Eurytus, Charondas and Zaleucus, and Brysson, the elder Archytas also, and Aristæus, Lysis and Empedocles, Zanolxis and Epimenides, Milo and Leucippus, Alcmæon, Hippasus and Thymaridas, and all of that age, consisting of a multitude of learned men, and who were above measure excellent -->

Their writings and books were not composed in a popular and vulgar diction, and in a manner usual with all other writers, so as to be immediately understood, but in such a way as not to be easily apprehended by those that read them.

This is because they adopted that taciturnity which was instituted by Pythagoras as a law, in concealing after an arcane mode, divine mysteries from the uninitiated, and obscuring their writings and conferences with each other.

Hence he who selecting these symbols does not unfold their meaning by an apposite exposition, will cause those who may happen to meet with them to consider them as ridiculous and inane, and as full of nugacity and garrulity. 

When, however, they are unfolded in a way conformable to these symbols, and become obvious and clear even to the multitude, instead of being obscure and dark, then they will be found to be analogous to prophetic sayings, and to the oracles of the Pythian Apollo. 

They will then also exhibit an admirable meaning, and will produce a divine afflatus in those who unite intellect with erudition. 

Nor will it be improper to mention a few of them, in order that this mode of discipline may become more perspicuous= Enter not into a temple negligently, nor in short adore carelessly, not even though you should stand at the very doors themselves. Sacrifice and adore unshod. 

Declining from the public ways, walk in unfrequented paths. Speak not about Pythagoric concerns without light. And such are the outlines of the mode adopted by Pythagoras of teaching through symbols.
