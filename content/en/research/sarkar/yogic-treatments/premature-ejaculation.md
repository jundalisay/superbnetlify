## Causes

- Lack of proper sexual knowledge in adolescence or early youth
- Loss of semen through unnatural means
- Lack of restraint in married life
- Eating non-vegetarian food
- Using intoxicants from an early age
- Too little physical work and too much mental work
- Failing to follow the rules for fasting, bathing, taking water and sun-bathing 


## Treatment

Treatment, diet, and dos and don’ts are the same as for impotence. 

Low thinking, bad company, intoxicants and non-vegetarian food should be completely given up. Seeing pornographic pictures or films, reading pornographic literature, etc. are also to be forsaken.


## Remedies

1. One inch of basil (Ocimum sanctum Linn.) root, if eaten after chewing very well along with a betel (Piper betle Linn.) leaf daily for about two weeks, will give excellent results.
2. Well-developed roots of the shimúla tree should be dried in the shade and ground into fine powder. 1/4 tola of this powder should be taken along with milk every morning.
