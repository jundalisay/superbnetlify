## Symptoms

When undigested food builds up offensive internal gas puts a severe strain on the intestine which gets dislodged from its normal position. It opens a hold in the abdominal wall, and protrudes through it.

“Inguinal hernia” is the dislodged intestine coming out through an opening left in the canal to the scrotum.  

“Femoral hernia” happens if it pushes out through the hole in the canal of nerve fibres and the muscular network controlling the legs. 

“Umbilical hernia” happens if it pushes out through the navel opening of children. 

As long as it is possible to push the protruded intestine back inside or to pull it back into position temporarily through suction, this condition, through painful, does not become fatal. 

But if the protruded intestine becomes hard like a rope and obstructs then normal functioning of the lower anatomy, then the disease can be said to have reached the critical stage. When the protruded intestine becomes trapped in the opening, causing severe suffering to the patient, then it is called a “strangulated hernia”.

## Causes 

Food enters the stomach and there gets partially digested. It then passes into the duodenum (upper intestine) for complete digestion. Too much non-vegetarian and  fatty food aggravates the acidity of the blood. As a result, different hormone-secreting glands become weak, and the partially-digested food starts decaying inside the body, creating a foul and poisonous gas which, in turn, puts pressure and strain on the stool-filled intestine and forces its dislodgement. Therefore failure of the liver to digest all the food properly is the main cause of hernia.

## Diet

Hernia originates from intemperate food habits. Special care should be taken about food – especially regarding non-vegetarian food and food which may cause constipation.
Hernia patients must never completely fill the stomach, in order to prevent pressure on the stomach. One should take a small quantity of food a greater number of times, rather than to eat a large amount at one time. 

Drinking a small amount of water or lemon-water many times a day is also advisable. A hernia patient should also remember to maintain a slight but continuous feeling of hunger. Hernia patients should get out of the habit of straining while defecating.


## Dos and don’ts

Do not bend forward to lift heavy articles, jumping about excessively, over-eating out of greed and indulging in sex are all very harmful.
