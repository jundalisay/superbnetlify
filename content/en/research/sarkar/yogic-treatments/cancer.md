## Symptoms 

Tearing pain in the diseased region, a very intolerant temperament, hyper-sensitivity to touch, weakness and nausea, etc., are the main symptoms of this disease. In the preliminary stage of the disease the patient does not suffer from much pain, so in the beginning the disease is generally overlooked.

## Causes

Cancer is a disease of the whole body as well as a Tridośaja disease (i.e. involving disturbances of váyu, pitta and kapha). 

This disease is a combined effect of many different factors. It is ordinarily observed that persons who suffer from constipation as a result of violating the health rules, and who likewise are lazy, lack self-restraint, sleep during the day and keep late nights, are most likely to be attacked by cancer.

When due to constipation, the blood and the muscle-fibre become worn out by the contaminated digestive fluids of the body and the contaminated air produced by them, cancer sets in. Parts of the internal organs of people who are extremely self-indulgent become weak. 

As a result of the attrition of shukra, their body loses its vitality. When such people eat too large a quantity of non-vegetarian food, their blood turns acidic and the disease gradually breaks out in the weaker parts of their bodies.

With those people who shun physical labour but take acidic food, chillies, or intoxicants and especially tobacco and similar things – there is every possibility that the disease will attack.

<!-- Treatment= The appropriate ásanas and mudrás will have to be prescribed after ascertaining the reasons why the patient is suffering from the disease. Constipation is generally one cause of this disease, so special attention must be paid to regular clearance of the bowels.
Morning – Utkśepa Mudrá, Násápána, Diirgha Prańáma, Yogamudrá, Bhújauṋgásana and Karkat́a Práńáyáma.
Noon – Same as in the morning except Utkśepa Mudrá and Násápána.
Evening – Matsyendrásana, Padahastásana, Utkat́a Vajrásana and Karmásana.
 -->
If the patient is unable to perform the above four evening ásanas, he/she should practice Sarváuṋgásana, Matsyamudrá, Naokásana and Pashcimottánásana. If he or she is also unable to perform these, then he/she should do the same ásanas as at noon.

Taking Vyápaka Snána every day is a must. If health permits it can be taken both at noon and in the evening.

## Diet

In order to reduce the acidity of the blood and make the liver function normally, patients will have to eat alkaline foods as much as possible -- all kinds of fruits and roots, vegetable soups, etc.

Depending on the condition of the liver, sufficient milk will also have to be consumed.

If the liver is bad, the patient should drink, instead of cow’s milk:
- coconut milk
- peanut milk
- curd-water

The evening meal should be finished before 8 P.M. 

The patient should let the breath flow through the right nostril for about 1 hour after each main meal.

The patient should drink about 2.5 seers of water every day but never more than 1/8 seer at a time. 

The following are both food and medicine:
- pineapple
- jám
- banana
- all kinds of citrus fruits
- tomato


## Dos and don’ts

Cancer patients should take sun-baths at sunrise:
- between 9 and 10-11 a.m. in the summer
- between 9 a.m. and 12 noon in the winter.

After the sun-bath, the whole body of the patient should be wiped with a wet towel.

Excellent results can be obtained if the patient applies river mud all over the body every day and afterwards bathes in the river. 


Strictly avoided are:
- sleeping during the day
- staying awake at night
- chillies
- non-vegetarian food
- sexual relations

Patients should go to bed every night by 8:30 or 9 PM so that they may get up very early the next morning.


Necessary are: 
- walking in open places as the strength allows
- physical labour for those who are lazy

Eating a piece of myrobalan after a meal is always helpful to clear the bowels.
