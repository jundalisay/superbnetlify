Passage: Burdwan is an ancient city of Bengal. It is a district headquarters and university city. It is on the River Damodara. There is a road-bridge over the river named Krśak Setu (কৃষক সেতু). (Krśaka [farmer] is grammatically incorrect. It should be karśaka, কর্ষক)

There are five sub-divisions in Burdwan District. Many great persons were born in this district.

General Knowledge: Burdwan comes from the Sanskrit word Vardhamána (বর্ধমান). It is a prehistoric town, in fact, the oldest town in the world, and at the same time the capital of the oldest land of civilization – Ráŕh.

Capital: Capital means "concerning the capita, or head". Burdwan is as important as the head for the land of Ráŕh.

Ráŕh: The land was known as Ráŕh (রাঢ়) because of its laterite, or red, soil.2

Burdwan: Burdwan is a city, as its population is more than one hundred thousand. Its original name was Ástikanagar (আস্তিকনগর), which means "a town that pays respect to God and credence to Providence". Later on the name became Atthinagara in the Prákrta language. Vardhamána Maháviira, the propounder of the Jainistic cult, came to Burdwan and preached his gospels for a period of seven years. Thereafter the name of the city was changed to Vardhamána.

The land of Ráŕh is a part of Bengal. "Bengal" is also a time-honoured name.

Burdwan is a district [as well as a city within the district]. In the pre-Pathan period, a district was known as a bhukti (a bhukti is just like a county in Britain). In the Pathan and Mughal periods, the word zilla was substituted for the word bhukti. In the British period, a zilla became known in English as a "district". There are five sub-divisions in Burdwan District.3

Burdwan is situated on the north bank of the River Damodara. The Damodara is the biggest river in Ráŕh. It comes from the Ramgarh Hills, and its confluence with the Ganga [Ganges] is on the border between Howrah and 24 Parganas Districts. (Dáma (দাম) means "fire". Udara (উদর) means "belly". Dámodara means "where fire is burning in belly"). The bed of the Damodara is rich in coal deposits. That is why such a name has been given to the river.

Krśaka: The word krśaka is grammatically incorrect because, if the suffix -ńak (ণক্) or the suffix -kan (কন্) is added to the root verb krś (কৃষ্), the derivatory word should be karśaka, as in ákarśaka (আকর্ষক), vikarśaka (বিকর্ষক), saḿkarśaka (সংকর্ষক), etc.

As the land is an ancient one, many great personalities were born there. The names of some of those personalities are given below:
