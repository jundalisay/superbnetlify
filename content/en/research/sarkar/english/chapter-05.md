Principal verbs have no plural forms.

<!-- (1) For instance, I meditate, we meditate. He/she sang three songs, they sang three songs. -->

Auxiliary verbs, with the exception of the verbs be and have no plural forms.

SINGULAR | PLURAL
am (I am going.) | are (We are going.)
is (He is doing.) | are (They are doing.)
