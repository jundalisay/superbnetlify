Lord Shiva Never Did It 


"You must treat him very well. Give him solace whenever possible, serve 
him in sickness. Whatever he needs, give it to him. Beyond that, the only 
remedy is meditation." 

Long range words 

The treatment that Baba gave to Keshava from Germany was peculiar. 
After the General Secretary took Keshava through a typical set of questions & 
answers about 16 Points, Baba proceeded to speak to him in Sanskrit. Keshava 
didn't mind; he understands very little English anyhow. Some of the Indian 
workers who could understand Sanskrit said that Baba was speaking about the 
law of action and reaction. At the end of the session, Baba took Keshava's head 
in His hands, and, rubbing it affectionately, said in English, "My poor boy ... 
my poor boy 

No one could understand the meaning of this, including Keshava. 
Nevertheless, Keshava was so inspired he decided to go for acharya training. 

[Author's note: Keshava became an acharya, and then an avadhuta with the 
name Gunaragananda. In 1991, I spoke again to Gunaraga-nandaji about his 
dharma samiksha. His bewilderment about the meaning of Baba's words "my 
poor boy" was apparently resolved when he had a serious car accident while in 
the Sweden acharya training center. He nearly died in the accident, and needed 
many months to recover. Severe scars remained. I say "apparently resolved" 
because a few years later, as an acharya, he had another accident in a car in 
Venezuela, in which the car flipped over several times, killing the driver. 
Gunaraganandaji was thrown a few meters away from the vehicle, even though 
he had been sitting in the back of the two-door car. Again it took months for 
him to get back on his feet. Hardly had he recovered when there was another 
incident. This time it was in Ananda Nagar, where he wandered into the jungle 
far away from our central quarters, fell asleep after doing meditation, and was 
attacked by tribal people. They stabbed him repeatedly and stole the little 
money he had. 

He told me, "Baba's words in dharma samiksha helped me to keep going 
ahead even during these worst experiences. I accepted the suffering as a part of 
my spiritual path. I believe that during dharma samik

sha Baba foresaw my death, and changed it into a series of accidents, which 
allowed me to go on working for the mission."] 

Not your fault 

Brother G from the United States stood in front of Baba. After some 
personal talk, Baba said, "Your mind is unnecessarily disturbed about the past. 
You made some mistakes of a sexual nature." 

G's face suddenly became very red. 

"Yeah ... yes, Baba," he mumbled. 

"When you were younger you had some misunderstanding about the 
relationship between men and women." 

He stared at the floor, saying, "Yes, Baba." 

"But it was not your fault. As a little boy you were simply influenced by 
your environment." 

G looked up at Baba. He sighed deeply, smiled slightly and said, "Thank 
you, Baba." 

"No need of thanks," Baba said. "I merely convey to you the unadulterated 
facts. You were unaware. Unaware." 

G approached me after the session, wanting to get something off his chest. 

"I never told anyone, Dada," he said, "but since you were present today, I 
want to tell you that... that before joining Ananda Marga, I had ... improper 
sexual relations." 

He watched for my reaction. Seeing none, he continued, "Even though I've 
been doing meditation for a number of years, it's always bothered me; I've 
always felt guilty. But now Baba's freed my mind. When He said it wasn't my 
fault, something let go inside me. I feel so light now; I wouldn't be surprised if 
I started to fly!" 

Another episode from dharma samiksha: 

BABA: Throughout your life you have had one obsession, one greatest 
fear. What is it? 

MARGI: Ah ... (apparently confused and unable to reply) 

BABA: In your previous life you were a priest of common status. His duty 
kept him fixed at one temple. He often thought, "How can the idol I worship be 
God? God cannot be limited to a statue. So how 



Lord Shiva Never Did It 


266 


can I find God?" He studied and searched for the answer. But one morning, 
before he could come to a clear understanding, a snake bit him as he was 
picking flowers to offer to the goddess. Lying in the grass, in great pain, he 
thought, "If there is a God He must save me. Or at least He must properly guide 
me in my next life." Thinking that, he died. That is why you are here today. 
And that is why you feared snakes so much that you even imagined snakes 
where they were not. But from today, that fear will no longer trouble you. 
Now, my boy, are you satisfied? 

MARGI (smiling): Yes, Baba. Very very much. 

My dharma samiksha 

I stood before Baba for my own dharma samiksha. After passing through 
the normal preliminaries. Baba commented, "He has some sincerity, but it was 
better before." I was mystified by this statement. 

While analyzing my physical condition. He said, "There is weakness in 
your Vishuddha Chakra. 73 " The asanas He prescribed were almost completely 
different from what I had expected. This was because I gave little importance a 
minor operation I had on my knees when I was sixteen years old, and to some 
weakness in my waistâ€”but it seems Baba considered these defects to be 
critical. 

The most beautiful element of my session, however, was something I am 
unable to adequately describe. It was how He looked at me and how He 
touched me. His eyes penetrated far into my soul. From that moment until even 
now as I record this memory, I have been feeling an extraordinary sort of 
ecstasy. Toward the end, He embraced me in such a way that every cell in my 
body burned with excitement. I lost consciousness of everything except Baba 
Himself. I was so happy that my mind stopped functioning except for the 
thought Baba, Baba, Baba. I'm not sure how long I had been sitting in His lap, 
when I suddenly became aware of someone pulling me off of Baba, saying, 
"Come on, others are waiting, you know." I fell into prostration in front of 
Him, and then had a hard time struggling to stand up because my mind was 
almost out of touch with my body. 

73 The fifth chakra, located in the center of throat

Travels with the Mystic Master 


[Author's note: Years later I add two comments in retrospect. First, I still 
cannot understand what He meant by my being "better before." Did He mean 
my meditation, my dynamism, my devotion, my work, all these things, or 
something else? I don't know. In any case the effect of His words is that I 
always feel like I do not express my full potentiality, no matter how much I try 
and no matter what I do. And yet I don't feel any inferiority complex because 
Baba did not compare me with anyone else, only with my previous self. Thus 
His comment has never stopped pushing me. 

Second, though I had no recognizable trouble with my throat before my 
dharma samiksha, I have often had problems with it ever since. J 

Important to us, unimportant to Him 

Dada A, born in the Philippines, received dharma samiksha. When Baba 
referred to A's secret weakness, he became so agitated that he soiled himself. 
All of the Dadas in the room saw a little bit of his diarrhea drip onto the floor. I 
suppose he had stomach trouble, and could not control himself. 

Baba's personal assistant, Dada Ramananda, said quietly in Bengali, "Baba, 
the boy soiled himself." 

But Baba seemed not to hear. He went on dealing with Dada A. 

After a minute, the General Secretary said something similar to Baba. 
Again Baba paid no attention. Some of us whispered between ourselves. But 
Baba continued, unruffled. 

When at last He took Dada A upon His lap and lovingly hugged him to His 
breast, Ramanandaji spoke again in Bengali to Baba about the feces. Baba lost 
His smile, and replied in Bengali, "What? Why didn't you tell me before? 
Immediately clean up the floor! He must not stay here another moment! Nasty, 
nasty!" 

Two Dadas pulled Dada A out of the room, though he didn't care-not only 
because he hadn't understood the Bengali, but also because Baba had finished 
the dharma samiksha, and blessed Dada A with His embrace. Rather Dada A 
was so ecstatic, he must have been unaware of his own dirtiness. 

We all laughed into our hands. I loved Him even more for pretending not 
to hear until the session was finished.

You win 

Madhusudan, who was my guide in Mokamo during my field training in 
1972, stood in front of Baba for dharma samiksha. 

BABA: If you are following 16 Points you should step to the right side. If 
you are not strictly following, step to the left. (Madhu begins moving right.) 
Wait. Do you have a shaoca manjusa? (A small bottle containing water, which 
is used for cleaning oneself after passing urine.) 

MADHU: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: But do you use it regularly? 

MADHU: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: No, it is not true. You have not been regular in usage. MADHU (in a 
strong firm voice): Yes I was! (He again starts stepping right.) 

BABA (to other workers): Do not allow him to move right! MADHU: But 
I'm following 16 Points! 

BABA: Two days ago you were in Patna at Dag Bangla Charaha Crossing 
at 9:30 in the morning. You passed urine but did not use your shaoca manjusa. 
Is it not? 

MADHU (laughing loudly): You win, Baba. (He steps left.) 

BABA (smiling): Just see, just see. 

A secret revealed leads to freedom 
Brother M stood before Baba. 

BABA: Before becoming a Margi, were you a worker for the Communist 
party? M: Yes, Baba. 

BABA (chuckles, then says): How was the character of your fellow 
workers? 

M: Very bad. Baba. 

BABA (a little indignant): And what about your character, my boy? 

M: My character was good, Baba. 

BABA (a little angry): Tell the truth. 

M: I've made no such mistake. Baba. 

BABA: You are lying. 

M: No, I'm not lying, Baba! 

BABA: Come forward for atonement. (As M slowly begins stepping to the 
front, Baba leans forward with His stick.) 



Lord Shiva Never Did It

M (slightly stepping backward): No, Baba! I did nothing! BABA (in a strict 
tone): Turn around, and look to your rear. M (Turns his face around. He sees 
something which we do not see): Oh, Baba! 

BABA (in a threatening tone): Need I say anything more about hat happened on 
1st April? M: No, Baba! (He throws himself in prostration at Baba's feet.) 
BABA: That will not suffice. Come to your feet. (M stands up. Baba beats him 
several times.) 

Afterward, when M was asked what he saw, he said. "Didn't you all See 
her? When I turned around, I saw my lady friend dressed in a black sari. She 
was a secret, burning in my heart." Then he smiled, saying. "But now I'm free." 

Beyond criticism 

Sister Aruna from northern Sweden stood before Baba. After going through 
the formalities of her name, duty, and so on, the General Secretary began 
asking her about 16 Points. 

Baba interrupted, saying, "There's no need to question her about her 
conduct. She is trying her best." 

We were all astonished. This was the first case of any Margi being declared 
uncriticizable. 

I looked at Arana's face. Instead of noticing the expansion of ego that such 
a comment would have caused in almost anyone else, she looked 
unselfconsciousâ€”her eyes glistened with tears. She was lost in the ecstasy of 
being with her Baba. 

The flow of dharma samiksha has been different from Personal Contact. 
Over the past few years I saw many reactions to Personal Contact. My own 
Personal Contact was a case in point. But every dharma samiksha without 
exception resulted in unparalleled inspiration. Baba's remarks were so 
individualized, both in rebuke and in praise, that each Margi was fully satisfied. 
The majority of us could confirm that He knows our most closely kept secrets, 
and knows every wave of our mind and body. I am sure that each and every 
Margi thought something like, "He cares for me. He loves me."

In the last weeks. Baba gradually became sick. Today, August 24, the strain 
of altering our mental and physical condition reached the limit. He announced 
that the dharma samiksha program is now finished. 

Conflict with a dancer of darkness 

Lucknow. After the flood of feelings generated by dharma samiksha, 
today's experience served as an ideal epilogue. But first something about 
yesterday. 

Yesterday I left Calcutta by train for Delhi. Shortly before Delhi, a bridge 
collapsed; how, I never came to know. From that point on, the train moved 
backward to access a different route. But the speed was so pathetic that a 
distance which ought to have taken one hour took over twenty. At one rural 
station, while having a brief walk on the platform, I heard a sudden mixture of 
shouts and screams. Rocks flew through the air. The women and children ran to 
get back into the train. Not having the vaguest idea of the cause, I joined the 
ladies in retreat. As I jumped inside, I looked back in time to see a rock strike a 
man in the forehead. The scene was dotted with tiny pools of red blood. 

As the ladies madly pulled down the iron shutters on the windows, I asked, 
"What's happening?" 

One of them replied, "The passengers are protesting that the train is taking 
so long." 

India: everything is hereâ€”from the crudest vulgarisms to the subtlest 
sublimities. This leads me into describing today's episode, the cherry on my 
dharma samiksha cake. 

Tonight was the third night of the new moon. I was busy the first two 
nights and this was the last possible night for doing my kapalika meditation. I 
had no choice but to break my journey here. 

This was my first time in Lucknow and I had no idea where I could find the 
cremation grounds â€” the place for burning the dead, which is always located 
on a river shore. My questions raised a few eyebrows, but ultimately led me to 
a quiet corner of the city where I met the servant of a rich businessman. His 
master was out of town, so he invited me to rest in his humble quarters. He said 
he would show me the cremation ground at midnight. 

In the meantime, this illiterate man became intrigued by my talk of 
meditation. I initiated him. We meditated together, and had a simple 



271 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


supper. Later, in the dead of the night, he led me toward the river. As we came 
closer and closer, however, his legs seemed to drag. 

"Sir, that's it... there," he said, pointing a shaking finger at the darkness at 
the end of the road. 

"Very good," I said. "But don't call me Sir." 

After walking some steps, I noticed he was lagging behind. "Come along," 
I said. "What's the matter?" 

"Sir ... ah, Dada, don't no go, Sir. Bad ... verry bad ..." 

"Nonsense. There's nothing to be afraid of." I continued walking. I heard 
him start panting. 

I arrived at the gate. He hung back about ten feet, shaking. 

"Pie pie pleazzze. Sir ... no, no!" 

"If you don't want to come in with me. it's no problem. You can go back to 
your house, and I'll go in alone." "Really, Sir?" "Yes, sure. Why not?" 

Saying, "Okay! Okay!", he spun around and took to his heels, sprinting 
back down the road so fast that he reminded me of a character in a Charlie 
Chaplin film. 

I turned back to face the gate. I noticed the total absence of sound. Even the 
leaves were silent. It was, somehow, artificialâ€”too sudden. This may be 
interesting, I thought. 

I passed through the gate and began walking down the grass-covered steps 
in the pitch darkness. I could only feel my way forward. Slowly, slowly... 

A yell came from below! I halted to listen. A man's voice, harsh, 
threatening. I knew enough Hindi to understand his unmistakable warning: 
"Don't dare to enter! Get out of here!" 

An Avidya Tantric, I thought. A lover of the dark force. A personal-power 
seeker. A black magician. 

Yes this will really be interesting, I thought, smiling. 

I stepped down: one step, two, three... 

Again he shouted, with a guttural force I had never encountered before. "I'll 
kill you, you madman! Begone! Begone!" He swore at me, using very dirty 
language. 

My mind was calm. I was a bit surprised how I was taking it. This was to 
be a challenge arranged by Baba's grace. I went on thinking of Him, confident 
that no power could be greater than His. 



Lord Shiva Never Did It

I walked further, and at last was the bottom of the stairway. 

"I'll murder you!" he screamed so loudly that I was momentarily stunned. 
Then I think he added, "And drink your blood! And eat your flesh! And 
swallow your bones!" 

I had heard that some Avidya Tantrics can consume an entire human body 
in one sitting. It is one of their systems for extracting power from other 
Tantrics. 

To hell with you, I thought clearly. I felt he could hear my thoughts. And 
perhaps it was so. For, as I continued on, he made no further sound. 

His voice had come from the darkest comer of the place. In that direction, 
nothing was visible. In other directions though I could perceive vague shapes, I 
was unable to recognize anything. Then I saw a faint red light. It was the dying 
remains of a fire, a few embers. I walked toward it, feeling my way forward 
with my sandaled feet. 

What was that? A movement near the fire ... what? ... a pair of ... yes ... a 
pair of eyes. I walked nearer. What? Not two eyes, four. No, more.... Many 
many eyes. Fantastic! I went on walking, thinking of Baba with each step. 

Then I made out a form: a dog. No, there were many dogs. Scores of them. 
Maybe thirty or forty. As I drew closer, I could see their eyes gleaming with 
excitement. They were eating the last remains of a dead body. Their teeth 
glistened. They growled menacingly, facing me. I felt I could hear their 
thoughts: Don't come forward anymore! 

To hell with you too, I thought in reply. I continued moving toward them 
now that I could make out a path which passed near the fire. If I moved in any 
other direction God knows what I might have fallen into. 

They growled louder. Though my body moved on, my thoughts stood still, 
contemplating Guru. I passed in front of the dogs. They snarled and bared their 
teeth but let me pass. 

As I walked on further, I heard the bubbling of a river. I walked up to it, 
and put my materials on the sand. This was my spot. After preparing for the 
meditation, I started dancing Shiva's Tandava to increase my courage. 
Immediately the man yelled and the dogs barked. With each step, I leapt high in 
the air, laughing in transcendental pleasure. 

Then I sat. At last, undisturbed by any sound, I easily slipped into deep 
meditation. 



273 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


When I finished, I walked back toward the fire. The dogs were still there. 

But this time something was different. They looked mad. Their mouths 
hung open, saliva dripped from their teeth. They growled loudlyâ€”very loudly. 
Perhaps they were angry that I had succeeded in thwarting their efforts to stop 
me. 

Seeing no alternative way, I continued walking toward them. They began 
moving here and there, and... what? They assumed an ominous shape. In the 
front was one dog, then two dogs, then three or four, then moreâ€”it looked like 
a triangle or a wedge pointed at me. Suddenly, they charged, growling 
furiously. Though I was still thinking of Baba, He put another idea in my brain: 
I 'll kill the first dog, I thought. 

In the very next moment after that thought, even before my hand could 
reach toward the knife which was in my pocket, the lead dog jumped into the 
air and let out a human-like scream. He somersaulted backward, smashing into 
the other dogs. Some of them screamed, others barked in low voices, as they 
fell apart from each other, confused, hurt, scattered. 

I watched it all, from a point deep inside, not from my normal waking 
consciousness. The dogs looked away from me, whimpering, crying, and lost. 

I walked on, came to the stairs and climbed out of this bizarre world. The 
man and the dogs had fallen into silence. Coming up onto the road, I didn't 
bother to look back. 

Delhi. I mentioned yesterday's episode to an old Dada here. He said, "Yes, 
those dogs were real dogs. But they were controlled by the mental power of the 
Avidya Tantric. It's a common phenomenon. He uses them for many purposes, 
including both protection and attack. When you thought to kill the first dog, the 
man surely caught your thought, and was terrorized. If you had killed that dog, 
who was moving on the thought currents of the man, it would have caused him 
great harm. It might even have killed him. That's why there was such a reacÂ¬ 
tion. Anyway it's Baba's play. He arranges such experiences for those who need 
them. If we surrender to Him. we pass the test. Of course the tests never stop. 
But. then, neither does His grace."

People's movement 

Manerbio, Italy. 1982. The Margis have uncovered a major case of graft 
and corruption, and have organized a movement to try to stop it â€”Prout in 
action! 74 In a few months the local government plans to close the Manerbio 
hospital and shift its facilities to another town. The only reason for the move is 
the financial benefit it will bring to the host of companies involved in the 
construction of the new hospital. The losers will be the people of Manerbio, 
who will lose their hospital. 

Sister Damayanti is the leader of this fledgling movement, along with her 
husband Jiivananda and two other Margis. Over the last few weeks many 
volunteers have helped them to distribute leaflets and collect petition 
signatures. Today they held their first demonstration. It was a grand success. 
Over 4000 people came and joined in the march. 

Two months later. By now, the "Save Our Hospital" movement has had 
four demonstrations, with up to 8000 participants apiece. A few days ago an 
incident occurred which showed how much the local people have come to trust 
the Margis: During a village meeting held in a market place, speakers 
expressed their opinions about city conditions. At one point, a well-known 
priest said, "We have to encourage more 


74 At this point in time, Prout people's movements outside of India were still a novelty, i.e, such 
work had only just begun. Though M argis were the leaders of these actions, the participants 
were primarily non-M argis. The actions were of two main typesâ€”positive constructive 
programs and anti-exploitation drives. For example, I had recently participated in initiating a 
mass-housing action in Holland, and an anti-pornography drive in Norway. In India, Prout 
people's movements had already begun many years before. Some had the support of hundreds 
of thousands of people.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


the involvement by the young people of our city. Just see what good work is 
being done by those leading the Save Our H ospitat movement." 

From the crowd one women yelled back, "Si, noi crediamo piu in quei 
giovani che in te/â€”Yes, we believe more in those young people than in you!" 
Another yelled, â€œPerche voi preti non avete fatto niente per salvare il nostro 
hospetale tanto tempo fa?â€” Why didn't you priests do anything to save our 
hospital long ago?" Someone else added, "Te giusto Stai saltando sul populare 
vagone della bandalâ€” You're just jumping on a popular band-wagon!" 

An incident happened today which also demonstrates the movement's 
strength, but in a shocking manner. After a morning meeting in one section of 
the city, the Margis drove to another meeting in a different part of town. 
Damayanti was so inspired she sang Baba Nam Kevalam the entire way, about 
thirty minutes, over the loud-speaker system mounted on the car's rooftop. At 
the foot of a hill leading up to the meeting site, the car's engine died. After the 
Margis got out of the car, a man opened the hood to check on the cause of the 
failure. He discovered a bomb lodged there! Because Damayanti had been 
using the amplifier throughout the whole drive, the weak electrical system was 
sufficiently over-taxed to cause the engine to die, leaving an insufficient charge 
for the bomb to explode. 

Though the lives of the Margis were obviously saved by the grace of Baba, 
this experience shook them up. They had not understood the extent of the 
danger they faced from opponents of their movement. 

Two weeks later. Today the local government announced its decision not 
to shift the hospital. A big party will be held by the public honoring Damayanti 
and the other leaders of the Save our H ospital movement. 

Over the last weeks Damayanti and Jiivananda's meditation became 
irregular. They gave more importance to their social work than to their spiritual 
practices. As a result, their behavior became more aggressive and egoistic. 
Fortunately, through discussion with acharyas a few days ago, they recognized 
this loss of balance â€” and they re-started their spiritual discipline. 

It is surprising but true that those who work more also need to meditate 


more.

A desperate attack 

Luxembourg. 1 May. There is news from Calcutta. It is so outrageous, so 
abominable, so heinous that I find it difficult to write. 

Yesterday morning at 6:30, our workers were attacked while coming by 
taxis to our Calcutta headquarters. Seventeen Dadas and Didis were killed in an 
atrocious manner. The same vicious tactic was used in each case. The attackers 
stopped the taxis at railroad crossings, pulled our workers out onto the street 
and first beat them with iron rods to make them helpless. They then blinded 
them by throwing acid in their eyes, gouged out their eyes with knives, stabbed 
them repeatedly, and finally doused their bodies with petrol and burned them. 

Over the last few weeks, the Communists prepared the public for this 
attack by holding small street demonstrations and claiming that our orphanages 
and schools are full of children we stole from their parents. In response, we 
approached both politicians and newspapers to show the documentation of all 
the orphans under our care. We challenged the demonstrators to produce even a 
single parent with a complaint against us. Instead of responding to our 
documentation, the Communists tried to drum up further hostility by repeatedly 
shouting over loud-speakers "Beware of the Ananda Margi child-lifters!" 

Only when the attacks occurred did anyone recognize that the demÂ¬ 
onstrations were part of a strategy to protect the true villains. At yesterday 
morning's press conference. Communist politicians claimed that the violence 
was the spontaneous result of mob psychology, and that the attackers were 
parents and local people. 

From the first, however, the public and the media unanimously rejected this 
explanation. The claim that it was a spontaneous uprising was patently absurd. 
How could a spontaneous uprising happen simultaneously in three separate 
locations, using identical methods? The local police were also responsible. For 
one hour after the attacks they refused to initiate an investigation, even though 
their station was within 200 meters of the incidents. 

The attackers' true intentions become clear once you add the fact that our 
Central workers come to the office by taxi at just this hour every day. Only 
because Baba requested a special meeting the previous night was their schedule 
different yesterday. The mobsters planned 



277 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


to kill the Central workers, but instead the victims were all school teachers 
coming for a teachers' meeting. 75 

It may seem strange, but the Communists fear our moral integrity and low- 
budget social work. In comparison they know that their government looks 
corrupt and ideologically backward. Our legal section has filed cases but the 
attackers have already absconded through police complicity. Since we well 
know that the West Bengal government will never make any investigation, we 
are demanding an inquiry by the federal government. Considering that Ananda 
Margis have never engaged in violence, and that we have been victims of 
numerous personal and property attacks by the Communists, one would think at 
least the federal government will cooperate. But I do not expect cooperation, 
because the federal government is as corrupt as the state body. 

In the face of these assaults, and without hope of government or police 
assistance, should we give up our social work and our social movements, and 
join the under-the-table diplomacy which rules the country? 

Or should we gain strength and inspiration from the understanding that the 
corrupt are bound to attempt to destroy those who are non-compromisingly 
striving toward goodness? The answer is obvious. 

Necessary insight and intuition 

Calcutta. Several court cases are going on, most of them initiated by 
Ananda Marga to protest oppression by local communists or other politicians. 
While informing Baba of the progress of these cases, one worker asked Baba 
for guidance. 

Baba replied: "Ours is a missionary work. You are all working for long and 
have sufficient experience. Must I give suggestions on each and every petty 
matter? It gives me much pain. If you all are simply 


75 Since apparently Baba knew the attack would occur, the question may arise why He allowed 
the school teachers to fall into the trap. Why does Baba (or for that matter God) allow anyone in 
the world to suffer or die? I believe that suffering can often be a positive force in the path of 
spiritual awakening. We are born in order to realize life's lessons. Suffering and death are vital 
for that realization. Why Baba freed some people from certain suffering, and did not free 
others, isa far too complicated matter for me. Thedeep psycho-spiritual needsof both 
individuals and the society are involved. Surely He had His plan, and followed it.

sincere with your meditation and 16 Points, you will get the necessary insight 
and intuition. This applies to all workers." 

He requested this statement to be made known to all workers. 

Just words 

Ananda Nagar. During afternoon reporting, one-by-one we stood in front of 
Baba, undergoing His scrutiny. When it was my turn. He exposed some of the 
defects of my work, and then began beating me with His stick. 

The General Secretary said to me, "Give some explanation." 

Usually workers reply by saying something like, "I will do my work better, 
.Baba," or "I tried my best. Baba, but couldn't get the public's response," or 
"Baba, Baba, Baba!" or some other unimpressive statement. Generally He 
continues the beating for some time. 

But I said spontaneously, "I am lazy and selfish!" 

His whopping became softer. 

"I am stupid and insincere!" 

The beating stopped. "What do you say, my boy?" Baba said. "I will change my 
ways and not waste a single solitary moment!" I said decidedly. 

"Yesss. Very good." 

Afterward, one Dada said to me, "Those replies to Baba were very clever." 
"But I meant it," I said. 

During the night reporting that same Dada came under Baba's stick. 
Immediately he said. "I'm worthless and slothful!" Beat beat beat. 

"I'm egoistic and not industrious!" Beat 
beat beat. 

"Yes, yes. We know that," said Baba. 

Beat beat beat. 

"But I'll become a perfect worker, Baba!" Beat beat 
beat. 

"Just words. Just words," said Baba. Beat 
beat beat. 

The Dada looked at me. I shrugged my shoulders.

"Baba, Baba, Baba!" he said. 

The beating went on about double the normal time for him. 

Penniless in the Arctic 

Nuuk, Greenland. 1983. I was the first worker to visit this Arctic colony, 
the biggest island in the world. Previously I worked in the southern part, but 
this is my first time in Nuuk, the capital city. I have no contacts here and no 
return ticket. Back in Denmark I purchased a round-trip ticket from 
Copenhagen to Sundre Stromford. For a bit of fun I only brought enough 
money for a one-way ticket from there to Nuuk. I'm scheduled to be here for 
ten days. In the meantime Baba, you'll have to create enough Margis to pay for 
my missing plane fare, and my daily expenses. To add some spice to this brew, 
one of the Danes I met today said, "Good luck to you. It's a rare Eskimo who's 
mind is not lost in booze, dancing and motorcycles." 

The winter is harsh here. Half the flights usually get canceled due to bad 
weather. As I walk through the streets, I sometimes have to grab onto a tree to 
stop myself from being blown over. It once took me forty-five minutes to walk 
a distance which should have taken fifteen minutes. Coming back, I needed 
only five minutes â€” I was almost flying. Even the women wear pants here, so I 
am doubly unique in my orange lungi, which billows in the wind like a full 
skirt. I don't know why I remain warm even while trudging through deep snow. 

Nuuk is called "the big city", though its population is a mere 10,000. In 
total, Greenland has a population of about 50,000, of which 80% are Eskimos 
and 20% are Danes. By World War II the majority of Eskimos had converted 
from nomad-life to town-life, though not out of preference. The shift was 
primarily to assist doctors who were facing difficulties trying to protect the 
people from diseases caused by "civilization". 

Since it is my policy not to stay in hotels while teaching meditation. Baba 
kindly arranged for me to "accidentally" meet a man who invited me to stay in 
his house. (One way or another, no matter where I am. He always provides a 
house for my stay.) I began setting up lectures immediately. 

Next day. While walking in the snowy streets, I was surrounded by a group 
of about twenty teenage boys. They were a rowdy bunch, itch

mg for a fight. When they began pushing one another, it became clear that their 
real intention was to get around to pushing me. They were keen to test this 
strange man with a turban. 

Later I came to know that it's considered comical in Greenland whenever 
anyone falls down in the snow, especially if one gets hurt. 

When they were just about to fling themselves into me, I had an inspiration. 
"I say! Do any of you know a good song to sing?" 

A few of them knew enough English to understand me, and they fell into a 
parley. Seconds later they burst into an Eskimo tune, complete with 
gesticulations. That completed, I requested another song, and they complied 
with increasing enthusiasm. 

Then they demanded a song from me so I regaled them with my latest 
frozen version of Baba Nam Kevalam. I made them sing it together with me, 
and soon we became fast friends. 

By evening, word had gone around about that fine Dada fellow. 

Coldest cold 

Last night I had to perform my kapalika meditation. The only graveyard is 
dead-center in the middle of the town, flooded by electric light, so I opted 
instead for a tiny dark peninsula where long ago the people used to bring sick 
babies who would be left in the cold for some hours. If they survived, they were 
considered strong enough to deserve care. If they died, that proved they were 
better off dead. 

Before beginning meditation I already felt chilled to the bone due to the 
freezing breeze. The wind was so strong that it tore off my lungi, which I had to 
dive to catch. Before I could grab it, the sea almost claimed it, and in the 
process I slipped on the ice just on the edge of the water, a dark mass of 
heaving waves. In the last moment, my foot caught on a jutting piece of ice, 
stopping my fall. I slowly edged my way backward a few feet, and arranged for 
my meditation without benefit of cover or blanket. 

After a minute or two I no longer noticed the intense cold. Indifference to 
temperature is a common experience for those practicing kapalika meditation. 
Thirty minutes later, when I had finished, I again became aware of my body, 
which began shivering so strongly that I could not hold my equipment. Hardly 
able to stand, I dragged myself toward a nearby house especially arranged for 
my stay on this night. 



281 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


After crossing the threshold, I laid thawing out on the floor about ten minutes, 
before moving toward my room. 

The next morning I was fine. No matter what difficulties I face during 
meditation, I never seem to fall sick. 

We had group meditation this evening. Because no one moved even 
slightly, and because there was heavy snow around the house, we experienced 
complete soundlessness. Impressive, especially considering it was their first 
such meeting. 

Nothing unlikely 

During my previous visit to southern Greenland a good number of people 
learned meditation. I didn't think to contact any of them, however, because the 
only way to travel between cities in winter is by plane. 

Yesterday, my first initiate down there had a strong thought of me and 
Baba. On the strength of that feeling alone, she flew here hoping to find me. 

When she saw me today, she was just as surprised as anyone else that her 
intuition had been correct. 

They say for the devotee nothing is impossible, or even unlikely. 

Faith and fortune 

A unit committee was formed tonight, selected from among the forty 
Margis who have learned meditation in the nine days since I've been here. The 
prediction about Eskimos lacking interest in meditation was wrong. About 80% 
of these new Margis are Eskimos, exactly reflecting their proportion in society. 

I spoke to the most inspired sister, "I don't have money for my return fare to 
Sundre Stromford. And I have to leave tomorrow evening." 

"Dada!" she said. "What are you going to do?" 

"No, no," I laughed. "That's my question to you." 

"But I'm just a student..." 

"Can I see your tongue?" 

She stuck it out. 

"It looks like a healthy tongue. Perhaps it will be of some use in asking the 
other Margis for help. But don't press them. They should only give according to 
their feelings." 

She flashed a big smile and immediately left the room.

Next day. That sister ran up to me late this morning, saying. "Dada, look! 
We collected half of your ticket money! Here, please take it." 

"Thanks. Just see how Baba helps." 

"Yes.... Now what are you going to do to get the rest?" 

I laughed and said, "Again, that's my question to you." 

"But... I already asked everyone for money." 

"Well, how about going back to them, and asking for ideas how to get the 
rest?" 

"But the airlines office closes in just four hours." 

"If you do your best, Baba will arrange everything. And remember, no 
pressure!" I said. 

When at last she proudly presented the necessary amount for my ticket, we 
only had time to run to the airline office and slip in the door as it was about to 
be locked. 

Who's depending on whom? 

Oslo. Today was the second and closing day of a skiing weekend that I had 
organized here in the Norwegian Alps as part of my regular sports and 
adventures program. 76 This was only the second time I'd been skiing. The 
first time was earlier this winter when I conducted a one-week outing in the 
Swiss Alps. Norwegians are a people said to be bom with skis on their feet. We 
held racing competitions. To allow me to participate, they gave me a liberal 
handicap of one minute on each run. 

Toward the end of the day. in an effort to see how fast 1 could go, I ordered 
my feet not to turn inward, i.e. I would not allow myself to slow my downhill 
speed. I was soon moving faster than anyone else on the mountain. It was 
exhilarating. The only problem was that I had not yet mastered sharp turning. 
Because I could not turn around each of the skiers I was passing, I had to yell at 
those in front of me, "Look out! Look out!" Once they saw me they jumped out 
of the way. A neat, albeit, self-centered system. 


76 At this time I was working as sectorial secretary of the Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures 
Club, Two or three times a month we conduct weekend outings in different regions of the sector 
These programs ranged from mountain climbing, horseback riding, boating, forest hikes, and 
sports matches on up to full scale training camps teaching relief skills, first-aid, self-defense, 
survival ski I Is and higher philosophy.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


At last I came to the final turn, sure that I had cut at least two minutes from 
my previous best time. As I rounded the comer I had a shock. Directly in front 
of me was a group of about thirty students, surrounding their teacher, who was 
lecturing them on some subtle point which demanded their full attention. When 
I yelled "Look out! Look out!" none of them heard. Within a moment I was on 
them. At the last moment they noticed me and scrambled out of the way. One of 
them, however, was not quite quick enough. My skis latched onto his; my head 
continued forward while he was thrown down; and then my feet, still wearing 
the skis, flipped over my head as I flew through the air over a fence. 

While most of the route is open, fences are erected only where the fall is 
precipatedly steep. Thus, as I merrily winged my way over that fence, thinking 
of Baba, I was blissfully unaware that I was courting sweet death. What trouble 
some of us children make for our Father. He was compelled to save me by 
arranging my head-down-feet-up fall in a tree in such a way that my skis 
caught in the branches; I finished my route hanging upside-down with the top of 
my skull a few centimeters from the ground. 

Throughout the weekend a fourteen year-old lad had taken a special interest 
in me; we usually skied together. This time, however, I had left him far behind 
in my flakes. Now, as he caught up, he saw me dangling from the tree, and 
shouted, "Wow, Dada! How'd you do that?" 

"I'd prefer to tell you a little later," I said. "Now how's about lending me a 
hand, brother?" 

It was nearly as dangerous getting me down as it had been getting there, but 
after a few minutes of nerve-racking efforts, my young friend had me back on 
my feet. Unbeknownst to me, the entire escapade, including my brief flight, had 
happened in plain view of the 200 or so skiers who were waiting for the ski-lift. 
I was met by loud applause while finally skiing down to the bottom. 

The only explanation I can think of why He bothers to save such zany 
people like me time and again, is because normal conservative people are 
unwilling to lead this sort of Tantric lifestyle in which one never knows what 
will happen next. Baba simply has no alternative. 

Entertainment at government expense 

Paris. Last night, while traveling in a train and sleeping alone in a six-seat 
compartment, I was woken in an unprecedented manner. A

strong flash of light hit me directly in the face. Immediately I opened my eyes, 
sat up, and saw a man still holding a camera. Without even donating a few 
francs for the privilege of taking my portrait, and without offering a smile, he 
turned on his heels and high-tailed it out of the compartment. And I, without 
any idea as to what I was after, jumped up, and ran in pursuit. As I James- 
Bonded my way down the corridor, I passed a man walking in the opposite 
direction. Arriving at the link between two cars, I suddenly thought. What a 
dope I am! That was the camera-man, throwing me off his scent by acting 
opposite my expectations. I swung around, and raced back, just in time to see 
him disappear through the door leading to the next car. I rushed forward and 
turned the door handle, but he had locked the door behind him. 

Well, I'm not so easily deterred, I thought, and dashed back to my room, 
opened my bag, and took out the key used for the doors between cars. (Because 
I spend so much time on trains, it is convenient to have this key.) Hurrying 
back to the locked door, I opened it. and entered the next car. 

Though I looked at everyone in that car, I could hardly guess which of the 
apparently sleeping suspects was the real spy. Full of wonder, but not 
downcast, I returned to my cabin. Id given it a good try. but once again those 
fellows had gotten the upper hand. I laughed at what expense and trouble they 
were going to in building up their files on such a carefree, harmless guy. They 
consider me a dangerous radical, not realizing the true nature of the spiritual 
revolution for which I am struggling.

Calcutta. Today, during reporting, Baba divided the Dadas into two 
groupsâ€”ERAWS (Education, relief and welfare section) and TRIO (a 
conglomerate of the three other major trades). I took my place with the rest of 
the Trio group. 

Baba instructed each group to condemn the members of the other group for 
insufficient speed in our work. Since criticism is a natural lower tendency, 
everyone passionately threw themselves into the allotted task. 

I stood directly in front of Baba, two feet away from Him. The other Dadas, 
all Indian, yelled accusations back and forth in Hindi and Bengali. Since these 
languages are not my forte, I remained silent, preferring to feast my eyes only 
on Baba. For about ten minutes I did 



285 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


nothing but stare at Him, entering into a higher and higher state of mind 
Meanwhile the room was filled with emotion-laden vocabulary. Baba's 
expressions varied throughout, shifting from frowns to smiles to head-nodding 
to "Here here!" and so on. 

All of a sudden He looked straight at me, then pointed and said, "And you! 
What are you looking at?" 

I laughed loudly, then said, "I'm looking at my favorite person." 

"Eh, what do you say?" 

"I'm looking at You, Baba." 

"No, no, no. You also have to play the game. You are not exempt." 

Immediately, without waiting for any further prodding. I turned away from 
Him, and, looking at the ERAWS workers, I said loudly, "You are all just like 
a bunch of dirty ants, not using a drop of your potentiality; you only swim in 
the muds of staticity, becoming more and more grimy with each passing day, 
enjoying your useless existence, and speaking highly of how you moved a few 
twigs and leaves here and there; and then jumping on the nearest sugar cubes 
and licking and licking until you become sick and have to fast ('well it's fasting 
day, and we had to fast anyway,' you say), and proud that you move from place 
to place, diligently making a mess everywhere you go!" 

While I was speaking, everyone was laughing, and Baba said, "Just see ... 
Just see ..." 

"In short," I said, "the pigs who roll in filth are better than you, because in 
the end at least they provide a bit of protein to the meat-eaters." 

I swung back around to Baba. He stuck out His chin and pursed His lips, 
saying, "Yesss. Rightly said." He waved His hand at the others, and again they 
started up. I was left to return to my silence, and dived even more deeply into 
my contemplation of Anandamurtiji. 

This reminds me of a story of a brother who visited Baba in the jail some 
years ago. 

He was an Indian named Rajesh, who was by nature mild and quiet. After 
Rajesh was with Baba in His cell for five minutes, the guard said. "Time's up. 
You'll have to leave now." 

"Rajesh," Baba whispered, "the rule permits you ten minutes. Tell them 
strongly not to disturb us." 

Looking at the guards, Rajesh said softly, "Please don't disturb us."

The guards laughed. Then one of them said roughly, "Now get up and get 
out, young man." 

"Rajesh, you have to shout at them," Baba said. 

"Please don't disturb us!" Rajesh said in a louder voice. 

The guards didn't look pleased. The leader said stiffly, "You have to follow 
what I say. Now leave!" 

"I told you to shout," Baba said. "You've got to do it much louder." 

"You have no right to stop me now!" Rajesh yelled. "You are violating the 
rules, and you are infringing on morality!" Later he said that in all his life, he 
had never raised his voice so loud. 

"You cannot criticize us!" said the guard. "Get out now, or we will take 
physical action against you." 

"Rajesh, you'll have to use all your force and all your anger," said Baba. 

Rajesh stood tall, pointed his finger at the guards, and with burning eyes, 
and a blasting voice shouted, "Get away, you animals!! Or else you'll have to 
suffer forever!!" 

Without another word, the guards all lowered their heads, turned and 
slipped away, tripping over each other, leaving Rajesh and Baba alone. 

"Well done, my boy, well done," Baba said. 

Intervention 

Toronto, Canada. I've been assisting another worker here who is struggling 
to receive political asylum. I had some doubt if our approach was correct or 
not, so I called Calcutta two weeks ago. I asked Dada Rama-nanda to explain 
our strategy to Baba and to let me know His response. 

When I called back a week ago, Ramanandaji said. "I'm sorry. Baba has 
been too busy, and there was no scope to ask. Call me again in a few days." 

Three days ago I again called Ramanandaji and he said, "There's still been 
no chance. Please call later." His tone told me that he didn't want to speak to 
Baba about it. I was desperate, and thought, "Baba, please help..." 

Today I called Dada Ramananda, and he said, excitedly, "A funny thing. 
Honestly, I was hesitating to ask Baba. But just after your last call. Baba came 
out of His room and asked. Who was that on the phone just now?' In all these 
years. He has never once inquired about phone calls. I told Him your name, and 
before I could begin to explain your question. Baba said, 'Yes, I know what 
they are trying to do there. It is good. Tell them to continue their efforts.'"

It's certainly impressive that Baba knew what we were doing without 
having any objective information, but I give more importance to the fact that if 
He had not personally intervened we would never have received a reply. 

Bathroom power 

Oulu, Finland. I am staying in the home of a man to whom I taught 
meditation only yesterday. This morning, after he took his shower, he 
approached me and said, "Dada, I felt an extraordinary vibration in the 
bathroom just now. Did you cause it? Did you practice any special bathroom- 
meditation?" 

"Did you hear anything while I was in the bathroom?" I asked. 

"No. Should I have heard something?" 

"I mean did you hear any sound coming from the bathroom then?" 

"No. I was in my bedroom while you were bathing. It's too far away from 
the bathroom for me to hear anything." 

"Then I'm surprised. Yes, 1 always chant a special mantra when I finish my 
shower. But I never expected someone else might notice the after-effects on the 
bathroom itself." 

"It must be a powerful mantra! What is it? Please teach me!" 

Though I usually only teach this mantra to people who've been meditating 
for a good while, here was a man who was thirsty for experience, even in the 
bathroom. So I explained, "Whenever we take a shower, it's like a fresh start. 
Incantation of the bath mantra inaugurates our coming day, immerses it in God. 
1 love the feeling. While still wet, we face the sun or any other source of light 
and chant this mantra together with some special hand gestures ." Then I taught 
him the bath mantra. 77 

77 The bath mantra itself goes like this: Pitri purushe byo 
ndma/ia, rishi devebyo namaha 

I pay my respect to the ancestors, I pay my respect to the pioneers and wise people B rahmarpandm, 
Brahma havi 

The offering is Brahma (Infinite Consciousness), the object offered is B rahma Brahmagnao 
Brahmanahutam 

The One to whom the offering is made is Brahma, the person who is offering is B rahma 

Brahmaeva tena gantavyam 

The goal of the offering is Brahma 

Brahma karma samadhina. 

When the work of Brahma is done, s amadhi (self-realization) will result.

CHAPTER 17 


Forgetting and Remembering 

Not an ordinary body 

Calcutta. 1984. Whenever Baba walks downstairs for field walk. He always 
passes by a door behind which I often stand. I keep that door open a crack so 
that I can see Him. He usually stands there for some time, talking with two or 
three workers. I feel He does it just to please those of us looking through the 
crack. 

Today, however, He passed the crack without stopping. I saw Him for only 
a few seconds. Immediately after He left my field of vision, I closed my eyes 
and sat for meditation. A surge of energy rose in my body, halting only at the 
crown of my head, where it continued pulsating throughout a half hour of 
meditation. When I opened my eyes, the powerful vibration ceased. 

One week later. Over these last days I have been grabbing any opportunity 
to see Baba, even for a brief moment. Immediately after seeing Him, I do 
meditation. The throbbing experience invariably returns. This is my own 
personal proof that Baba's body is not like those of other people. Merely seeing 
His body induces a spiritual change in me. Now I understand the true value of 
both physically seeing Gum, and mentally imagining Gum. 

Yes, I understand. But how useful is it to explain this to others? 


When I mentioned my realization to Dada Amalvikashananda, he 
remembered an experience which he had in front of the same door. A very 
different sort of experience. 



289 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"A few weeks ago," he said, "Baba smashed my ego just beyond this door. 
I was standing there and talking with Him. He shouted at me about my poor 
work. I was so embarrassed, thinking that everyone was hearing. So very softly, 
I said to Him, Baba, excuse me, but maybe it's better you rebuke me inside the 
house; the neighbors are listening, and they may get the wrong idea.' 

"Baba raised His eyebrows and said sharply in English, 'Prestige, huh? 
Prestige...' 

"He let His words sink into my brain. Then without going inside. He went 
on shouting at me, with only one difference-His voice tripled in volume." 

New cultures: adapt or clash out 

Tokyo, Japan. After eight years working in Europe, I've been posted to the 
Far East Asia sector as the Public Relations Secretary, with additional duties as 
Medical Secretary and Publications Secretary. 78 Though our head office is in 
Tokyo, our greatest number of Margis are in Taiwan. 

This posting is interesting for me from a cultural perspective. It may also 
have a radical psychological effect on me because Oriental human relations are 
completely different from what I'm used to. Until now I could get away with 
being individualistic, forcefully determined, even blunt and ambitious. Not so 
here. These qualities are generally unacceptable among Japanese, Chinese and 
Koreans. 

[Author's note: Such changes in myself did not come as easily as I hoped. 
Though it did not take long for me to properly alter my external behavior, the 
more important development was a mental one. Orientals rarely directly say 
what they intend to communicate; most of them are more sensitive on the 
feeling level. So the mental change I had to undergo to live and work with them 
related to becoming more silent and attuning my intuition. It was such a deep 
process that, even now years later, I don't feel I have completed it.] 


8 The Far East Asia sector consists of J apan, Taiwan, South K orea, Hong K ong, M acao, 

M ainland China, Tibet, M ongolia, North K orea, Asiatic Russia, and thefiveAsian countries of 
theprevious Soviet Union. Because the last ten countries occupy 90% of the geographical area 
of the sector, yet were, at this time, under oppressive communist regimes, we were only able to 
work openly in ten percent of the sector.

Three months later. Public Home Concert program held for the public in 
the yoga center this evening. The program included mime, Indian sitar music, 
and modem dance. 79 

Bad stimulates good 

Train from Delhi to Calcutta. A song inspired by yesterday's train journey 
in an over-crowded second-class wagon: 

Riding on an Indian train, people sleeping brain to 
brain. Heads and feet in touch all the night, their 
minds adjusting more or less right. 

It's terrible to see men packed like sardines, sharing 
their chapatiis and beans. It's terrible to see men 
resting in filth, only to enrich those with the wealth. 

Refrain: 

Lovers of life reject the status-quo. Those who 
accept don't want to grow. Just now there's no 
room to doubt: we've to open to the flow of 
Prout. 

Those stinky lousy capitalistsâ€” in their faces they 
deserve flying fists to save them from the path of 
min, or else mankind will be destroyed soon. 

But don't you worry, Jimmy or Joe, 
there's purpose in this painful show. 


79 This was the first of our Home Concert series, which continued on a monthly basis for seven 
years. Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA) became well known to much of 
Tokyo's progressive community because of these special programs. I say special because in all of 
J apan, R A WA's concerts were the only informal affairs at which there was no smoking or 
drinking, at which the performers knew they would be watched with full attention, and after 
which fine vegetarian meals were served during which peoplehad an opportunity to socialize.

Realization comes out of clash. So pity the 
man with excessive cash. 

Refrain 

Bad is made to stimulate good, without which wed not 
know what we should. Without black there's no thing as 
white. Without love who could notice man's fright. 

To answer to the eternal call we've to polarize almost ail- 
so mediocrity becomes far less, and purpose comes from 
our unending stress. 

Prout, Prout: 

to get rid of all the doubt. Shout 
for Prout, and spout for Prout, bout

Do you like It, my boy? 

Ananda Nagar. 1985. Dada Yatishvarananda told me a story from his days 
as a regional secretary in India. Baba was making a tour of south India, and 
Dada was accompanying Him. Many local Margis came to meet Baba at an 
airport where His flight was in transit. In an informal mood. Baba asked one 
mother to pass her young son to Him. Baba took the boy in His lap. Dada was 
standing behind Baba, and was very curious because he had never seen Baba 
treat a child in this way. Baba smiled, then gently grasped the boy's lips, and 
sweetly said, "Yes, yes, my boy." The child became excited and shouted, 
"Baba! Baba!" Immediately the mother and most of the other Margis began 
softly crying. Dada said that he thoroughly enjoyed the scene, though he had no 
idea what caused their tears. 

Shortly after, Baba and Dada were called for their flight. Baba's security 
guard delayed slightly and then met them inside the plane. When he sat down, 
he said to Dada, "Do you know what really happened back there?" 



Forgetting and Remembering 


292 


Dada said, "No. Tell me." 

The guard said, "Afterward, I asked the mother and other Margis, who 
were all completely thrilled. They told me that even though that boy was four 
years old, he had never uttered a single sound. They believed he was 
completely mute. Though it seemed Baba made no special effort, He made the 
child speak." 

At this moment Baba turned His face toward Dada, and said, "Do you like 
it, my boy?" 

Fighting samskara 

Tokyo. Virendra from America is here. He is one of only ten non-Koreans 
in the world who have the top black belt of a Korean martial art called K ok Sul 
1/1 /on, the traditional self-defense method used by guards of the Korean royal 
family. Before becoming a Margi, Virendra had a job as a bouncer in a 
California bar. He had to deal daily with tough rowdy drunks. 

When I worked for Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures Club in Europe I 
often arranged self-defense training at our weekend camps. Over the years I 
experimented with different martial art systems. I searched for an instructor 
who could teach enough in a few days to be of practical use for our students, 
but I was unsuccessful in that search. 

I put the problem to Virendra, and he worked out a series of movements 
covering the most common situations which arise during confrontations on the 
streets of our violent world. Of course I asked him to teach me the course. This 
is the first time I've been able to really learn self-defense. 

One month later. I have been practicing Virendra's defense techniques. As 
a consequence, I've been itching for a situation to test my new skill. But I 
thought it unlikely; I've had no need to physically fight anyone for many years. 
Today, while passing through Shibuya, I ran into a Margi who sells paintings 
on the street. He had to go somewhere so he asked me to watch the paintings. 

Soon after he left, another street-seller appeared. He was a French fellow, 
and a head taller than me. 

"Get your stuff out of heere," he said. "This is my place." 

"They're not mine," I said. "I'm just guarding them for a friend. He'll be 
back soon."

"I don giive a damn! Move iit, or I'll destroy all these paintings." My heart start 
beating faster. Would I get a chance to use my new Skill? 

"I'm not moving, brother," I said, staring him in the face. "And you're also not 
going to touch the paintings." "You wanna fight, huh?" 

"No, I don't want to fight," I fibbed. "But if you'd like to fight. I'm ready." 

He rolled up his sleeves, flexing his muscles. I stood motionless, and 
centered myself as Virendra had taught me. Suddenly he rushed at me. He 
lifted his hands to grab my shirt-front and throw me on the ground. But as he 
did so, I raised my arms in between his, caught his wrists, stepped to the side, 
and pulled him forward in the same direction as his momentum. He fell in a 
heap on the ground, skinning his hands and knees. Fantastic! It was so easy! 

He jumped up, clearly shocked that such a small guy could trip him like 
that. 

"So! You reeally wanna fight, don't you?" he shouted. 

A crowd began to gather around. 

"I told you," I said evenly. "I'm not interested in fighting. It's up to you." 

His eyes shifted nervously as he said, "Are these paintings really not 
yours?" 

"Of course not. My friend will come back soon." 

"Okay," he said softly. "Let us wait for him." 

The crowd dispersed. I offered him a seat. 

The Margi took a long time to come back, so the Frenchman and I got to 
know each other. He had many personal problems, and ended up by asking me 
to teach him meditation. 

I admit I shouldn't have desired this sort of confrontation. But sometimes 
the wild child inside me gets the upper hand. I was lucky this time that Baba 
didn't punish me for my foolishness. 80 

80 The physical world directly reflects the needs of one's mind. A seasoned spiritual aspirant 
usually remains busy in dealing with responsesto very old needs. When such a person createsa 
fresh strong desire for anything, that desire is bound to get fulfilled. Usually it happens sooner 
rather than later. Conscious desire is dangerous, however, because it is contrary to the path of 
selflessness.

Non-stoppable devotees 

Calcutta. Among the different gifts I brought for Baba this time was a 
bottle of chocolate Horlicks powdered-malt mix. 81 Today I was happy to see 
Dada Keshavananda prepare a big glass of the Horlicks for Him. 

A few minutes later, Dada came out of Baba's room. He put the half-empty 
glass on a table. "Did Baba enjoy it?" I asked. "Of course." 

"Did you mention my name?" "Of 
course." 

"Thank you. Now, how about a little prasad (spiritually vibrated food)?" 

* 

"What?" he said. "Don't be silly. You know wholetimers can't take 
chocolate." 

"C'mon, Dada. It's prasad. No problem." "Noway." 

Starting to advance toward the glass, I said, "Please, Dadaji." "No. You're 
not permitted." 

"Well, I'm just going to take it," I said, moving closer to the glass. "No. 
Don't touch it." "I'm taking it." 

"No! It will... what are you doing?" "Drinking 
it of course!" "You drank it!" "Of course." 

Even in the case of Dadas, boys will be boys. 

[Author's note: This reminds me of an incident that occurred when Baba 
was in Germany. At 10:00 a.m. on a fasting day. Dada Karuna 


81 Dadas and Didis are not permitted to eat mildly stimulating food I ike chocolate, non-herbal 
tea, coffee and Coca Cola, Baba, however, did not follow such a restriction because He wished 
to provide a living example not only for renunciatesbut also for family people (who are 
permitted to eat such thingsin moderation). For the same reason. Healso shaved. However, He 
fasted four times a month like a renunciate, and of course completely refrained from 
consuming such foods as meat, fish, eggs, onion, garlic, mushroom, alcohol and narcotics.

nanda and I were waiting for Baba in His house. We were alone when we 
noticed four glasses, each with a small amount of orange juice. Obviously this 
was the remains of a pre-dawn drink Baba had taken in preparation for fasting. 
We grinned at each other, and, without exchanging a word, each picked up a 
glass and bottomed-up. Then, laughing with glee, we proceeded to the third and 
fourth glassesâ€”merrily breaking our fasts. Actually, I didn't really feel as if I 
had broken my fast, since the orange juice was pure prasadâ€” not food. I didn't 
feel the slightest twinge of conscience. To the contrary, even now looking back 
so many years, I still derive a certain pleasure from the simple devotion that 
guided us. ] 

Real life drama 

During our global reporting sessions, Baba has a fixed order in which He 
calls the representatives from the different sectors of the world. At present I am 
representing Hong Kong sector, which is always the first sector to be called. (In 
Ananda Marga, the Far East Asia sector is called 'Hong Kong sector'.) 

The session began: 

BABA: How many district in-charges came from the ladies' section of 
Hong Kong Sector? 

GLOBAL HEAD OF WOMENâ€™S WELFARE DEPARTMENT: Ah... ah... 

BABA: Speak up. 

GLOBAL HEAD WOMENâ€™S DEPARTMENT: Ah... none. Baba... 

BABA: Haat! What nonsense? Let the lady representative of Hong Kong 
Sector step forward. (Silence. No one moves.) What is this? Is there no 
representative even? 

GLOBAL HEAD WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT: I ... I'm sorry. Baba. She 
did not arrive yet. (In fact, all the Didis of all sectors except Hong Kong are 
present. There is no question of "yet".) 

BABA: What a sorry scene. Stupid, nonsense. Then let the male 
representative of Hong Kong Sector step forward. (I move to the front.) What is 
the excuse? (I remain mum.) How can you justify such nefarious behavior? 
(Though; I am silent, and nothing could be more awkward, nevertheless I'm 
enjoying His attention. Any attention is better than none.) And how many 
district in-charges are present from the male side of Hong Kong Sector? 



296 


Forgetting and Remembering 

ME (unhesitating, with a clear voice, head unbent): Zero, Baba. (An abrupt 
silence rolls over the room. Everyone holds their breath, expecting an onslaught 
from Baba. Sure enough...) 

BABA (shouting at such a volume it can be heard well beyond the closed 
door): What?! You foolish idiot! Scoundrel rascal! Then what was your purpose 
in coming here?! Have you come just to enjoy yourself?! Just to kill our time?! 
You have no right to be here! (Pointing His finger toward the door, He shouts at 
ear-splitting volume:) Get out!! Get out!! Get out just now!!! 

ME (speaking quickly): But, Baba, district in-charges are on their way from 
Taiwanâ€”they will surely be here any moment. (Though this is a possibility, it 
sounds like a common, lame excuse. Everyone in the room remains super tense.) 

BABA (turning His head from side to side, squinting His eyes, pushing His 
lower lip out, and speaking in a radically opposite voice, that is, softly and 
slowly): But... don't they know? ... Don't they know that they are to arrive here 
by the 30th?... GS Dada? (Confusion reigns in the room due to Baba's sudden 
mood change.) 

GENERAL SECRETARY: Yes, Baba, they must know. (Silence as Baba 
turns His head again and again.) 

BABA (in a low, almost inaudible voice): Alright... and ... Manila Sector ... 
what is your status? 

After receiving Baba's spiritual force, my mind was so blown that I could not 
think what to do next. Several Central workers motioned me to fall back into 
line. The session continued on a low key. 

A few minutes later. Baba signaled the end of reporting. After the Didis and 
sisters left the room, we performed M adhur Sadhana in front of Baba. 82 Then He 
left the room. Immediately, four or five Central workers came to me and asked, 
"What happened? Just when we were sure you would be out on your ear, and all 
of us would have to step forward to give explanation for your indiscipline; just 
when we thought there would be a thick drama complete with punishment; just 
then. Baba changed His mood and let you go. He saved you. Dharmaveda- 
nanda." 

82 Madhur Sadhana is a special spiritual practice which includes kiirtan. It is done only by 
acharyas. Didisand Dadasperform it separately.

"I don't have any idea," I said. "My district in-charges really are coming, 
you know." 

"Sure, sure!" they all laughed, not believing me. 

Two overseas workers then walked up to me. Expressing surprise, they 
said, "Hey, what? You're still here? But Baba told you to get out, didn't He?" 

Now I laughed. The tension and impact created by Baba's shouting had 
been so much that these two workers had not even perceived the exchange 
afterward between Baba and me about the Taiwan district in-charges. These 
two must have been in shock. 

I was about to leave the room when Baba's personal assistant, 
Keshavanandaji, re-entered. "Dharmavedananda, Baba just asked me to collect 
any further information on the Taiwan district in-charges." 

"I don't know," I said uneasily. "They were... supposed to come by now." 

"Baba mentioned that they may now be somewhere between Nepal and 
India." 

"It could be," I said. "I don't know." "And He 

wants an investigation made." 

I laughed nervously. What was this all coming to? Was He planning to 
catch me on another day about my so-called missing Margis? I sighed, thinking, 
H e will do whatever H e likes. A rid whatH e likes is perfect. 

Three days later. Twice daily Baba has been asking for any report on the 
Taiwan Margis. At last today information arrived from northern Bihar near the 
Nepali border. The four Taiwan Margis really are thereâ€”but they are in jail! 
Getting Indian visas in Taiwan is an extremely long process, and to avoid being 
late, they came without visas, trying to cross the border without being seen. 

Surely Baba saw their situation in that same moment when He suddenly 
changed His mood in reporting. 

Three months later. Tokyo. 1986. Today I spoke by phone with Taipei. The 
four brothers and sisters who were arrested in India arrived back home a few 
days ago. After their ordeal, they received a 



Forgetting and Remembering 


298 


hero's welcome. They spent three months being shifted from prison to prison in 
northern Bihar. For part of that time they were held in the Bankipur Jail in 
Patna where Baba had stayed. For one month they fasted on only water and 
juice to protest their imprisonment. During that time, they had special 
experiences of Baba's graceâ€”brother Keshava even had a few visions of Baba 
in his cell. Toward the end they all had the clear intuitive foreknowledge of the 
exact date that they would be released. Though they were unable to enter India, 
their risks and sacrifices led to some colorful moments. Dare I say the spiritual 
benefit was even greater than if they had passed undisturbed into India and 
physically met Baba? 

Dream trance 

Benefit concert held on behalf of our work in Burkina Faso, Africa. 550 
people attended. By the collection from this program a medical center will be 
built. 83 

I had a dream early this morning: 

After walking through a pasture alone with Baba, we stood outside His 
house. He told me, "It will be highly useful for you to engage in three 
activities. The first is writing. Your writing will enable you to contact many 
leading personalities. And that is your second work: to meet such leaders. For 
example, university presidents,...." His voice trailed off, so I could not catch 
the other examples. 

At that moment a few workers and Margis joined us. 

"I know some leading musicians who might perform for our benefit 
concerts," I said. 

"That's nice," Baba said. 

Brother Naviin, a Margi musician said. "I would love to hear those 
performers. Baba, a few years ago we arranged a large concert in the United 
States, but...." 


83 

At this time the work in Burkina Faso was only just beginning. It took several years to gain 
the trust of the poorest tribal people of this poorest African country. At the time of publication 
the project was established in twelve villages, providing training for the local people to construct 
wells, build irrigation systems, establish grain storehouses, and provide basic medical services.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Yes, I know," Baba said, smiling. "I was there with you. and it rained. 
Better to make such programs indoors." 

Before He could mention the third activity, we all went inside His house, 
and then into His office. He sat behind His desk and said to me, "Well, come 
here now. My son should get something." 

I walked up to Him. and He gave me a tap on the top of my head with His 
knuckles. I thought. Now let's see what I feel. But there seemed to be no special 
sensation. 

He directed me to sit down, and then said, "No need of any more words." 
He placed an egg-shaped bag over my head. I understood He was deepening 
my spiritual awareness. Gradually the breathable air decreased, but I didn't 
mind because I knew Baba was in full control. Thinking this. I entered a trance 
in which all thought was suspended. 

I awoke in that condition. 

Serenading God 

Calcutta. I and about twenty other Margis were singing Prabhat Sangiit to 
Baba. 84 He interrupted everyone to speak to me. Pointing to His throat, he 
said, "While singing, you should keep your mind concentrated here." I was 
surprised because when I was a child our singing teacher instructed us to 
project from the chest. Perhaps it is because Baba is more interested in the 
beauty of the sound than the volume of the voice. Or perhaps He meant that 
psychic concentration is on the throat chakra, but physical projection should be 
from the chest and lungs. 

A few days earlier He said, "Those who regularly sing kiirtan gradually 
develop a sweet and melodious voice." Is the reason simply practice, or is it (as 
I believe) because the kiirtan singer is not trying to impress anyoneâ€”only to 
serenade God? 

Luminous beings 

Tokyo. Six of us were sleeping (on the floor as always) last night in the 
large room of the yoga center. About 3:00 in the morning I sat up, saying, 
"Where'd they go? Where'd they go?" 

My voice woke Dada Ravindranath. "Where did who go?" he asked. 


84 PrabhatSangiitwere His " Songs of the New Dawn". He usually composed a few daily. 
Eventually Baba composed 5018 songs, all within a space of only eight years. 



Forgetting and Remembering

Suddenly becoming aware of him and the other Margis, I said, "You don't 
know but there are other beings in this house who are even more absorbed in 
music than you." (Ravindranathji usually plays Prabhat Sangiit several hours a 
day on his electric keyboard.) 

"What do you mean?" he said, his curiosity peaked. 

In that moment a thought strongly entered my mind: I must not speak more 
or I will forget everything I saw. So, I said, "Oh, it's nothing." 

Dada Nityashubhananda's voice floated over from the other side of the dark 
room, "It's not nothing." 

Unwilling to be deterred from my silence, I laid down and slept. 

In the morning, after rising. Ravindranathji said, "Dharmaveda-nanda, what 
did you experience last night?" 

"What do you mean?" I said. "I slept all night." 

"No, no, don't you remember?" 

In that moment the memory returnedâ€”and with it, a bolt of inspiration. 
Funny, I would have indeed forgotten it all if he hadn't questioned me. 

"As I lay sleeping," I said, "I felt an indescribable vibration which woke me 
up. I looked around, and saw scores, maybe even more than a hundred little 
people. They were pressed against each other, and against these two walls 
(which join in the comer where I slept). Those persons were far from ordinary. 
They were of many colors, sizes and facial expressions. But all had large heads 
with small bodies. Especially minuscule were their arms and legs. I am sure 
they were luminous beings. 

"I looked at them, and they looked at me for several long minutes. I was 
super-awake. The ones here were all siddhas or gandharvas (see following 
footnote). For that reason I said there were some who were more absorbed in 
music than Ravindranathji." 

Nityashubhanandaji then added, "Just before you spoke last night, a wave 
of energy rolled into me also, waking me up. That's why I sat up to do 
meditation. And that's why I knew what you saw was not nothing." 85 


5 Occasionally Baba would give demonstrations exposing the presence of such beings. At those 
times He enabled one or more Dadas to perceive these subtler beings. This was the first time I 
had seen them so clearly and in such number, though I had experi- [continues next page)

Forgetting and remembering 

1987.1 had a dream last night: 

It was set in the future; Baba was an old man. I was together with hundreds 
of devotees who I didn't recognize. We were high in the mountains, seated 
around a small bowl-shaped valley. In front sat the two foremost leaders of 
Ananda Margaâ€”a man and a woman. I knew neither. Baba sat behind us all, 
simply looking on without participating. Everyone's attention was absorbed in 
listening to the two leaders, whose words I cannot remember. 

I too stared at those leaders, until a thought entered my mind: / Ve forgotten 
Baba. 

Turning around, I saw that Baba had already left His seat. 

What is this1 Oh, where is He? I thought. 

Then I saw Him, off in the distance, together with two or three Margis. He 
was climbing the highest mountain peak. 

What a fool I am! Now I've lost this chance to be with Him. 

I saw Him pause by an outhouse. It appeared to be occupied, and He 
waited. As I jumped up to run after Him, I thought, I wonder what is the 
protocol here. Will anyone try to stop me? 

No one noticed me, and I was free. But after running a few steps, I 
remembered that I hadn't put on my sandals. So I ran back to look for them 
among the hundreds of other sandals. 


enced them countless times before in other ways. The yogis explain that a luminous being is an 
entity which has an elevated consciousness like a human but is different because its body is made 
up only of light, gas and ether. It contains no solid or liquid constituents.) ust as every being is 
born to fulfill its own needs along its own evolutionary path, so it is with the luminous being. In 
its previous life, a luminous being was a human who concentrated on a single desire such as the 
propensity to accumulate wealth (yaksa), or to develop artistically (gardharva), or to gain 
psychic experiences through meditation (siddha). To satisfy that desire, its primary activity as a 
luminous being is to intensify the environmental vibration in the field of spirituality or culture or 
beauty or economics or whateverâ€”according to its special need. Its range of activities is limited 
compared with humans. Itissaid that spiritually conducive place and many other places of 
intense activity attract luminous beings who enjoy or maintain or increase the energy. 

People who frequently practice kiirtan may distinctly hear other voices singing kiirtan. It is so 
clear that we often feel compelled to open our eyes, turn around and see if someone else has 
joined the kiirtanâ€”only to discover that no one else is there. But they are thereâ€”our physical 
eyes are simply unable to see them. The reader will remember an earlier entry about this. 




Forgetting and Remembering 


302 


If I don't find them soon, I'll go without shoes, or take someone else's. 

In that moment, I looked down, and saw my sandals on my feet. How 
strange. What was this except Baba's play? 

I ran to the top of the peak but Baba was gone. Thinking that He must have 
walked down the other side of the mountain, I dashed down the slope with my 
heart in my throat. On the way I encountered one of the mountain-folk 
devotees, a big fellow. He grabbed my arm, and ran at double my speed. As I 
struggled down the path with him, I wondered how I could keep up. Then a 
second giant devotee appeared and took me by my other arm. I laughed at this 
further play of Baba's, as I half-skipped, half-flew downward. They joined my 
laughter. 

Then I saw Baba far below, just as He turned a corner and moved out of 
view. The three of us went even faster, the branches whipping in my face so 
that I had to cover my eyes with my shoulder. I knew it was not only His play, 
but also a test that I must pass before I meet Him. Again and again He appeared 
momentarily, then disappeared around another comer. 

At last I saw Him standing in a fresh green field, surrounded by a score of 
devotees. The two giants released me, and I ran forward, thinking to embrace 
Baba. Something made me stop, however, as I came to the circle of devotees. I 
joined the circle around Him with the others. He wore a heavenly smile, and 
looked at us in a way that drove me mad. 

We are each HisRadha, playing Krishna Liila, I thought. 86 

As we danced, a young boy stepped out of Baba's body, holding a glass of 
juice. He tossed drops of that juice toward us, which we caught in our mouths. 
Then the boy materialized some small milk sweets, which he also threw to us. It 
was prasad, and I tried my best to catch it in my mouth. 

0 h, again I Ve forgotten B aba, I thought, and turned to look at Him. But before 
my face could turn enough to see Him, I woke up. Forgetting ... remembering... 
forgetting... remembering... Is it His one and only Game? 


86 A mythical scene of K rishna's childhood had Him in just this predicament, surrounded by 
many dancing girls, including Radha, His favorite. The myth represents the idea that the entire 
Cosmos is the play of God, and that every entity is knowingly or unknowingly revolving around 
the Cosmic Nucleus. Those who are aware of this gravitate quickly towards H im through the 
force of mutual love. 



303 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Yesterday evening I criticized a worker, even though other workers were 
also present. Afterward I regretted my behavior. While falling asleep, I pleaded 
to Baba to free me from this sort of nasty psychological tendency. 

Toward morning, I had a dream: 

A Margi sister committed an error. In front of others, I chided her 
repeatedly for her mistake. Eventually I lifted a stick, and, while still 
reproaching her, softly beat her on the head. She was thoroughly embarrassed. 

From behind a curtain I heard Baba's voice calling to her to come 
immediately. She left me and walked over to Baba. I felt very bad about what I 
had done. 

After a few minutes she returned. I asked her, "What did Baba say to you?" 

"He was angry with me," she said, "because I silently tolerated your public 
criticism of me." 

Before I could ask her anything more, Baba again called her out of the 
room. And I woke up. 

Now is what matters 

I had a long dream about Baba, but the beginning of it remains clearest: 

I was in a room with other workers. Baba appeared at the door and entered. 
I wanted to prostrate before Him. but as no one else did so, I refrained. A few 
moments passed as He walked through the room. 

I am late in offering sastaung pranam (prostration), I thought. M aybe it's no 
longer proper to do.... But devotion knows no time. Then and there I performed 
prostration. 

Baba gave me a beautiful smile, which made me thinkâ€” The delay had no 
importance for H im. Rather it was spiritually perfect. 

After undue hesitation, why should we hesitate even more?

Regular classes started for thirty mentally handicapped women. 87 They

As it turned out, almost all of them became positively enthusiastic. In general, mentally 
disadvantaged people love guided gentle movement which does not require too 
much coordination. At the same time, the hormonal balance of their glands improves, making

yoga postures, kiirtan. and a little meditation. Though some people have 
expressed doubt that such people could respond to yoga, many of the women 
were clearly interested during the class. 

Four months later. As it turned out, almost all of them became positively 
enthusiastic. In general, mentally disadvantaged people love guided gentle 
movement which does not require too much coordination. At the same time, the 
hormonal balance of their glands improves, making them physically and 
mentally calmer. Some of them even enjoy the deep silence of meditation. 
Permanent results of course take time to achieve. 

Good inspires, bad strengthens 

Calcutta. I was standing in the middle of the main downstairs room of 
Baba's house in Lake Gardens, surrounded by scores of workers and Margis, 
when one of my higher authorities. Dada M, walked in. Baba had been angry 
with him for not arranging a series of lectures for the Margis. Since Dada 
considered this my duty, now he was angry with me. This was a surprise for me. 
He shouted at me in such a voice that all the others in the room stopped their 
conversations, and turned to look at me. I saw no value in arguing, so without 
reacting or becoming nervous, I simply replied again and again, "Yes, Dada... 
Yes, Dada 

After a minute or two, he ran out of steam, and left in a huff. 

Immediately two Central workers approached me, and one said, 
"Dharmavedananda, I didn't know that you were such a seasoned worker." 

"What do you mean, Dada?" I said. 

"M yelled at you in such a way that it would have embarrassed even an 
elephant. But you took it as cool as a cucumber." 

I smiled. "Well. The credit doesn't go to me. It belongs to another higher 
authority I had for one and a half years. He constantly berated me and hounded 
me to the point that my nervous system can now stand just about anything."

We laughed together, and I added. "It's the beauty of Tantra, you know, 
that we can benefit from every situation. The good moments inspire us, and the 
so-called bad moments strengthen us." 

Soup kitchen started for homeless people in the Shinjuku area. Today we 
served 50 people, almost all of them men. During the program we were 
approached by two Christians who told us they had the responsibility to check 
if any of these people require medical attention. They requested us to inform 
them whenever we encounter such cases, because they are only able to check 
every two or three months, and it often happens that people suffer immensely 
or die in between these visits. Though the government allocates a reasonable 
amount of money to help disadvantaged people like the physically and 
mentally handicapped, the homeless people are neglected. They are considered 
an embarrassment, and both the public and the authorities tend to ignore them. 

Most people are surprised to hear that there are a few thousand homeless 
people in Japan. Almost everyone believes that the homeless are irresponsible, 
lazy alcoholics. Even some of the Margis think so. But the truth is far different. 
Most, or perhaps all of them had great suffering when they lived within the 
normal society. They were rejected or abused, and then in most cases became 
sick. We found them on the whole to be gentle and polite. Though drinking is 
common, few of them are alcoholics. It is presently beyond our capacity to 
establish a permanent center for the homeless, but at least we must find out 
their direst needs, and not allow them to suffer unduly. 88 


88 Over the years that followed, our volunteers probably did save the lives of at least a few very 
ill people who we took to the hospital.

CHAPTER 18 


Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


Like a mountain spring 

Calcutta, 1988. This morning, I left my notebook in the reporting hall just 
outside Baba's room. Side-stepping the security guard, I ran back up the stairs. 
When I was about to burst into the room, I had a shockâ€”Baba Himself was 
sitting there with three workers. I slammed to a halt on the stairway, and pulled 
back just enough to see, but not be easily seen. 

Within a moment, I guessed their purpose: Baba had composed a new song 
and He wanted them to record it. 

This was a sight extraordinaire, a private matter seen by few. I held my 
breath, hoping I wouldn't be noticed. 

Though they spoke in Bengali, I caught the gist. 

"I've composed a new song," Baba said. "Do you want to hear it?" He sat in 
His big chair, they at His feet. 

They turned to each other saying, "I don't want to hear it. Do you?" "No, 
not me." "Another time, Baba." They giggled like children playing with their 
father. He also laughed. 

"Well, I'll sing it anyway," He said. 

"No, no, Baba!" 

He put His finger to His lips to silence them, and began singing only one 
sound: "Na na na na na na na na na...." 

After He finished, He asked, "How do you like the melody?" 

They looked at each other, smiling. "Not very good." "I wouldn't say one of 
Your best." "Don't You have anything better?" 

Then He sang the words. At the time, I felt He was like a mountain 
springâ€”effortlessly and naturally singing without hesitation or thought. His 
voice was different than I had imagined, different from His speak-

mg voice (which is slightly nasal). He played with His voice like an instrument, 
perfect controlâ€”mellow, unstrained and pleasing. He had no written notes. 
They feverishly scribbled as He sang, trying to write every word. 89 

When He finished, there were no wisecracks. They were moved by the 
song, moved almost to tears. He waved His hand, and they began singing. At 
first their voices didn't perfectly reflect the melody-each sang in his own way. 
But as they continued, the differences diminished, and they fell into the true 
tune. 

At this moment, the cook was walking by the stairs. Seeing me, he came 
close, whispered "go away," and shooed me away with his hand. I had no 
choice but to leave. I walked down the stairs. A few seconds later, the coast 
clear, I silently came back up. 

Now Baba explained their mistakes, while they buried their faces in their 
notes, correcting them. Again the three of them sang, as baba nodded in 
approval. Even though I didn't clearly understand the song's meaning, by the 
time they came to the final notes, I, too, felt their ecstasy. 

They did prostration, and I knew I'd better get moving to avoid more 
detection. As I dashed out the main door, the security guard raised his 
eyebrows but didn't try to stop me. I looked back and saw the three workers 
walk into General Secretary's room, where I knew they would make a rough 
tape-recording of the song to ensure the melody would not be forgotten. Later it 
would be recorded it again by a skilled singer with instrumental backing. 90 

The Krishna connection 

Tokyo. "One of the gurus of the H are Krishna movement is in Japan now," 
said Dada Ravindranath. It was ten o'clock in the morning. "Do you want to go 
together with me to see him?" 

"I've already had plenty of contact with that religion," I said. "You go 
without me." 


89 

All of Baba's dictation and darshans similarly appeared spontaneous yet perfect. He dictated 
as much as possible for His booksâ€” several hoursa day. Heeven dictated while shaving. 
Afterward, when reviewing manuscripts, He only corrected the mistakes of the transcribers, 
and never needed to alter any of H is own words. 

90 

Several times a day Baba called these or other workers to record His new songs, even in the 
dead of the night. He summoned them whenever inspiration struck Him. Each song was 
profound and beautiful. Here I will give just one example. It is the rough 
translation Of song #1494: (continued on next page) 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor

One of my closest friends joined Hare Krishna nearly twenty years ago 
when we were in college. At that time he and I shared an apartment, and were 
practicing another yoga technique. We planned to become teachers of that 
technique and open a school in Portland. When he shifted over to worshipping 
Krishna, he tried his best to convince me to do likewise. A few months later I 
found Ananda Marga, and we lost track of each other. After that. I encountered 
the Krishna group in a few other places, but never asked about my friend. 

In the afternoon, while Ravindranathji was at the Krishna temple, I took a 
shower. As usual. I was singing Baba Nam Kevalam. I suddenly had a vision of 
my old friend's face, and a thought clearly passed through my mind: H e is their 
guru now. 

When Ravindranathji returned, I told him about my vision and asked him to 
describe the guru. 

"It'll be easier if I show you their magazine," he said, "because the guru's 
picture is there." 

He opened it to a full page color photoâ€”not only was it my old friend, but 
the facial expression was precisely as I had visualized while taking my shower. 

Without informing my name in advance, I went to the temple today. After 
their ceremonies, during which the devotees garlanded my friend, he turned 
toward me, walked over and we embraced each other. 

"After hardly thinking about you in years," he said, "somehow this morning 
I remembered you. and thought you might come." 

We had a lot to talk about. 


I n the fragrant breeze and sweet garden of my mind 
Come silently, Oh Lord of my heart. 

Noonewill know, I will meditate on You in mymind. 

Y our silent movements will beimperceivable. 

I n the depths of my thoughts I made a garland, 

And have coated each and every petal with sandalwood paste. 
Sitting in contemplation, I have forgotten to sleep. 

Celebrating Your arrival, my mind shivers. 

Incense, lampsand decorations are not needed. 

M y mind strives to merge with the Cosmic M ind. 

In meditation, in mantra, in joy, in enchanting rage, in tunes of love 
I paint myself with Y our colors.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Before his departure from Tokyo, I once more visited my friend, the H are 
Krishna guru. After doing Hare Krishna kiirtan together, we sat down to eat. 
The conversation turned to the books we had given each other three days ago. 

"I read your guru's book, Namami Krishna Sundaram" he said. "For him to 
write such things, he would have had to have most intimate knowledge of 
Krishna's pastimes and Krishna's thoughts. In fact, he would have had to be 
Krishna in a past life!" 

"Perhaps," I said, shrugging my shoulders. "It would be interesting, 
wouldn't it? But then, who am I to know such a thing? Unfortunately, He 
doesn't talk much about His past, what to speak of His past lives." 

A rain of grace 

Chiba, Japan. A good number of Margis, Dadas and Didis participated 
today in a program for about seventy-five handicapped people. This time we 
had a special experience seemingly orchestrated by Baba Himself. 

All of the disabled people were wheelchair dependents. Along with 
volunteers from other service groups, we went by trains and buses to a bunch of 
greenhouses full of bright strawberry plants, where we enjoyed picking and 
eating. After that we moved to a park for our picnic. The Margis were in charge 
of the entertainment. 

Maheshvara of Denmark is a professional clown and dancer. He had the 
whole congregation laughing, until it began drizzling. It looked like the picnic 
and our fun would get spoiled. At that point, everyone started moving toward 
the shelters â€” everyone, that is, except Maheshvara. He laughingly scolded the 
crowd for having little faith in the will of the Supreme Being. "Come back! 
Come back, and be brave! It is our Cosmic Father's duty to inhale this rain and 
keep our feast alive. He doesn't dare fail us, or else we'll stop believing in 
Him!" Hearing his words, the crowd hesitated, and mumbled among 
themselves. A few started returning to the field â€” and then all came back. 
Maheshvara shouted, "C'mon, Baba. Show your stuff!" As he continued with 
his show, the light drizzle also continued, but soon ceased. 

For two hours we remained there, laughing, eating, singing and playing 
music together. All that time the sky was dark. From time to time a few more 
drops fell. 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor

The program finished and we all filed into the buses. As we drove away, the 
drizzle again started. Windshield wipers washed back and forth at their slowest 
speed. 

The buses arrived at the train station. It took a few minutes to push all the 
wheelchairs inside the station building. Exactly the moment when the last chair 
came under the overhanging, the sky burst open. The very noise of the 
downpour was overwhelming. 

All of us stood there safely under the roof, gaping at the scene. Surely not a 
single one among us doubted that we had witnessed a show of Cosmic grace. 

The unsuppressable living tiger 

Calcutta. Today is the 10-year anniversary of Baba's release from jail. Dada 
Vijayananda gave a talk explaining a little of Ananda Marga's history up to the 
time of His release. Here are my notes from this talk: 

From 1955 to 1961 there were few rules in the organization. All the 
acharyas were family men and women. The work had only a little speedâ€”not 
great speed. Nevertheless, B.M. Malik of the Central Bureau of Investigation 
wrote in his book, "I was instructed by Nehru to be vigilant on two 
organizations and on a particular man. The organizations were the Communist 
Party and the Jan Sangh. And the man was P.R. Sarkar." That was in 1955, at 
Ananda Marga's inception. 

In 1961 the first training center was opened. The speed began to accelerate. 
The first avadhuta was initiated on 19th May, 1963â€”Baba's birthday. At that 
time the trishula (three-pronged pitch-fork of Shiva) was carried by avadhutas, 
and only later was the lathi (fighting stick) introduced. 

In the early years, I asked Baba if He would have Ananda Marga do service 
activities or not. He said, "Wait. All will come." Then, at the 1963 DMC, Baba 
took some tattered pieces of paper from His pocket. It was the Ananda Marga 
blueprint He had written at the age of sixteen (twenty-six years before). From 
that paper He declared the beginning of the Education Relief and Welfare 
Section (ERAWS). Then He said, "Do something." But for six months, no one 
had any clear idea what to do. At that time, Baba's mother did not want Him to 
write at night, so He had to write in secret by flashlight. In that way He wrote 
the ERAWS guidebook. Then we understood what to do. Accordingly, 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


ton 1st January 1964, the first two grammar schools were opened in J amalpur 
and Ananda Nagar. Over the years, Ananda Marga started more than 1500 
schools. But that first opening ceremony in Jamalpur was simply performed in 
the presence of the Service Department vol-unteers, one mother, two students 
and one snake. Due to the snake, the next day they brought cots for sleeping. 

On 5th March 1967, came the attack on Ananda Nagar during which five of 
our workers were killed. After that, the Communists started a strong vilification 
campaign against Ananda Marga. They told the Hindus that Ananda Marga was 
from East Bengal, and was a Moslem organization. They told the Moslems that 

Ananda Margis were fanatic Hindus. They told the tribals that Ananda Marga 
had come to take their land. They killed goats and pigs to show that Ananda 
Margis ate meat. But young people understood our vitality. Two years later, 

eighteen of our opponents were put in jail for culpability in the Ananda Nagar 
incident. From that point many began to understand that Ananda Marga was 

very strong. 

Mr Roy and three other important barristers made an alliance against 
Ananda Marga. They sent many letters to Indira Gandhi to poison Ananda 
Marga's reputation. They stressed, "This man P.R. Sarkar is dangerous, knows 
many things and can do much mischief. He is building a powerful organization. 
So no time should be wasted in striking against him. Yet remember, if you want 
to make a case against Ananda Marga, you must be very careful, because the 
Margis always find the loopholes." 

On 29th December 1971, eighteen charges and six murder cases were filed 
against Ananda Marga. The following points were highlighted: 

1) Ananda Margis believe in violence. 

2) The source of their funds is doubtful. 

3) Ananda Marga has connection with the American CIA. 

4) Ananda Margis are not morally honest. 

All eighteen charges were dismissed from the court, and the six murder 
cases remained. Ultimately we were exonerated on all those cases in 1978. 

Baba's fast lasted five years, three months and two days. During long 
stretches of that time He took only orange juice twice daily; and during much of 
the time, during the so-called Emergency rule of mar 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor

tial law. He took only water. After martial law ended. He took two cups of curd 
water daily. 

The then prison superintendent told me, "Baba is too extraordinary. 
Napoleon could be tackled in jail, but this living tiger cannot be dealt with." 
Baba gave all the jail officials a hot time, demanding that they perform their 
duties properly. The top prison official came to see Baba, thinking that it might 
be his only chance to see this great yogi. Baba covered Himself fully with a 
cloth, so the officer was not even able to see Baba's face. Baba charged him, 
"You are the Jail Magistrate who received my letter, but you took no step on 
my complaint." The official was embarrassed. Then Baba started calling him 
names like "filth, swine, rubbish fellow" and so on. The man became so angry 
he had to rush outside, breathing heavily. 

When announcement of the life-sentence verdict against Baba was given. 
He was on a stretcher. He simply smiled and said. "Now the tables will soon 
turn." One month after that, Indira Gandhi decided to hold general elections. It 
was her greatest misjudgment. A convulsion moved throughout the country 
because so many poor, innocent people had suffered under martial law. 
Especially terrible was Sainjay Gandhi's program of forced sterilization of 
sixteen year old slum boys. Mrs Gandhi's opposition, the Janata Party, received 
the vast majority of the vote. Late that night, Mrs Gandhi called her three top 
military chiefs, and ordered them to continue the Emergency. But they recogÂ¬ 
nized what consequences could follow, and refused to comply. 

On 3rd August 1978 at 6:00 a.m., all the offices and shops within six to 
seven kilometers of the Bankipur Jail in Patna were closed. About 7000 Margis 
arrived the previous night, and were joined by another 10,000. This sea of 
people clogged the streets for two kilometers. At 1:10 p.m. Baba was brought 
out on a stretcher. His weight had dropped from 72 kilograms to 46 kilograms. 
He had also performed a yogi's feat of suspended animation. The usual yogi 
who lives on air does not move at all. Excepting a stretch of eight days. Baba 
did not restrict His movementsâ€”though for one year He did not speak, and 
only wrote on a board. After His release. He remained four months in a 
wheelchair; His ankles and knees were too weak to provide support. 



313 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Usually Baba's darshans are appropriate for compilation into book form. 
For example. His Sunday darshans serve as chapters in Shabda Cayanika, an 
alphabetic encyclopedia, packed with original stories and information 
concerning the derivation of thousands of words. 

Today was different. Since it was the 10-year anniversary of Baba's release 
from the jail, His speech was special. It being rare for Him to talk of His 
personal life, I quote the translation of the darshan here in its entirety: 

We did not mean to harm anyone. But when adharmic (unrighteous) 
people use force against you, you must act in self-defense. This is not himsa 
(violence), it is pratirodha (self-defense). Those who opposed us met a pathetic 
end and have now merged with the soil. 

People who follow unrighteousness believe they have the right to do 
anything they want. One lady thought she could do anything she wanted with 
her power. When no reaction comes immediately, sinners think they can get 
away with more. But gaining power, going up, does not mean that they are 
getting elevated. Like the Indian washerman who raises the clothes high over 
his head, they go up very high only to come smashing down. 22 

Some people say that for every action there is an equal and opposite 
reaction. But I do not say that. After time, the reaction is greater because it 
comes with interest. 

Three thousand five hundred Margis and workers were arrested by the 
government. All were innocent, yet the political leaders felt no guilt at all in 
using their power against these innocent people. 

In jail, the Central Bureau of Investigation authorities harassed me in every 
way. For example, there was a rule that when I met with visitors the officers 
could be present, but not within hearing distance. One time, though, a new CBI 
man stood very close, silently listening. I asked him who he wasâ€”he replied 
that he was newly appointed. So then I asked him his name and address. He 
became nervous and could not 


91 Eventually I ndira Gandhi was killed by her own security guards, and her thoroughly corrupt 
son, Sainjaya Gandhi, died when his private plane crashed. One day before Indira Gandhi's 
death, Baba asked the meaning of the word assassination. He said that it came from one ass on 
top of another ass, and on top of that is/, and on top of that is the nation. Indira's other son, 
Rajiv Gandhi, then took her place asPrimeM inister, and was later also assassinatedâ€”finally 
ending that family's influence on India.

reply. So I shouted and abused him until he ran away. Then the other officers, 
who clearly were aware of this plot, began to criticize that man in order to 
appear innocent. 

But I had bit down so hard while scolding him that two of my false teeth 
broke. The next day, two specialists came from the government hospital to 
replace the broken teeth. I asked them, "How is it that these teeth broke so 
easily?" They replied, "Baba, they are only plastic, they are fragile." But 
according to the prison regulations, the treatment of the eyes and teeth of 
prisoners is their own responsibility, not the government's. I knew these 
specialists had been sent because the officers were feeling guilty at what they 
had done. So I asked them, "How can I chew my food every day with teeth 
given by the sinful government?" Then my personal assistant, Ramananda 
suggested that if we pay them for the work it would be alright, so I agreed. 

When I was released, there was such a long processionâ€”do you 
remember? The jail authorities, seeing the crowds waiting, told me that they 
would also be willing to undergo imprisonment if such a procession would be 
awaiting them on their release. 

I faced so much trouble in the jail. When I was released. I could not walk. 
To go to the toilet I had to hop on my hands like this (He demonstrated). I had 
to use a wheelchair. I remember that my elder sister brought me two luchis 
(small fried breads) and vegetables, but after my long fast I could only eat half 
of one of the luchis with great difficulty. 

I do not want anyone to undergo the same trouble that I did. But in the 
struggle for dharma (righteousness), if some trouble comes, you should accept 
it. If you pick a flower, you may be pricked by its thorns. Your consolation is 
that your struggle will surely end in victory. Our path is klista/dklistdâ€” initially 
there is trouble, but in the end there is no trouble. 

Dharma is the cause of victory. Intelligent people should take the help of 
Dharma. If you want to go to Jammu, you should take a seat on the Jammu 
express trainâ€”automatically you will reach there. Similarly you should follow 
the path of Dharma and surely you will be victorious.

Four problems to extinguish 

This incident occurred during the district in-charges reporting sesÂ¬ 
sion of the North Area of the Indian Sector. 

Baba called forward brother Ram Chandra. I was surprised because I 
knew this man tried for several days to arrange his personal contact with 
Baba, but without success. Because he had failed to establish a school, 
he was ineligible. He was also an arrogant fellow, with an argumentative 
nature. 

BABA: Fix your mind at manipura chakra (the navel center). Now 
raise it step by step. To the anahata chakra (heart center). To the 
vishuddha chakra (throat center). To the ajina chakra (third eye)... 
Now, are crude or subtle thoughts coming? 

RAM CHANDRA (standing with eyes closed): Only subtle thoughts, 
Baba. 

BABA: Now, take your mind downward. Vishuddha... anahata... 
manipura ... svadhistana (genital area)... muladhara (bottom of the 
spine). How is your thought now? 

RAM CHANDRA: Baba... material thoughts are coming non-stop. 

BABA: Again take your mind upward ... Wait. What's there at the 
kidney? 

RAM CHANDRA: I've throat trouble, Baba. 

BABA: No. The cause, the initial cause lies in the kidneys. Due to 
malfunctioning in the kidneys, toxic air rises up causing complication in 
the lungs. What's that at the anahata chakra) Did you ever have any 
violent experience in the area of your chest? 

RAM CHANDRA: I received a blow there when I was a student. 

BABA: Do the doctors tell you there is any medical problem? 

RAM CHANDRA: They say I have a peptic ulcer. 

BABA: Then why didn't you ever check it with Dada Vijayananda? 

RAM CHANDRA: Well, well... I thought I had tuberculosis. 

BABA: That's no answer. In fact, TB is there, but it's only developed 
one or two percent. Now, should I give punishment to you alone or in 
front of others? 

RAM CHANDRA: It's up to you, Baba. (He suddenly does prosÂ¬ 
tration at Baba's feet.) 

BABA: Stand up, my boy. Kinshuk, take my stick. (Kinshuk is Baba's 
adopted son.) Touch his left side. (Kinshuk touches his hand 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


316 


to RC's left side.) No! You must not touch with your hand, only with the 
stick! 

RAM CHANDRA: It burns where he touched me. BABA: Now touch him 
with the stick. (Kinshuk does so.) How does it feel? 

RAM CHANDRA: Oh ... it's very very soothing. 

BABA: I have a pet buffalo I brought up with much care. He can 
enter in any one's body, which is called Parakaya Pravesh. He can also 
enter anyone's mind, which is called Paramana Pravesh. I keep this 
buffalo always with me. Without him, you boys and girls would suffer a 
lot... This boy should have at least contacted the proper persons to ask 
about his problems. You must all be careful of four things: 1) sickness 2) 
enemies 3) debt 4) fire. Whenever any of these arise, you must 
extinguish them completely or they may come back. Let it be as a prinÂ¬ 
ciple in your lives... My buffalo has the eight occult powers and knows 
everything ... You must receive some punishment. What will it be? 

RAM CHANDRA: Any punishment, Baba. 

BABA: From now on you must be a good boy. Accordingly from 
today, you are completely cured. 92 

K ey to the key 

This incident happened during the reporting of North Area full- 
timers. 

BABA: Is there any will power in the protoplasmic cell of a plant, 
animal or human being? (No one answers. Baba points at one brother.) 
You, my boy, come forward. (He walks in front, does prostration, then 
stands.) As you were walking forward, did you feel any twitching in your 
back? 

FULL-TIMER (his face showing anguish): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: As you were walking up the stairway, you felt pain in your 
back. Just upon entering the gate of this house, you felt pain. As you sat 
and stood for your last meal, you felt sharp pain. As you stood up 


92 I inquired about R am Chandra a few months later. A Dada who knew him told me he had 
not only been completely cured, he had also become a model for all the other M argis. Each day 
after completing his normal job, he would dedicate several hours for social work. The units 
under his guidance were becoming more active, and a primary school was started. 



317 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


from your last meditation there was discomfort. You could not practice 
yoga postures properly for the last eight days due to the same problem. 
Can you clearly remember each and every one of these moments now? 

FULL-TIMER (smiling): Yes, Baba. BABA: Should we thank 
my flying buffalo? Yesss. Parama Purusha (Cosmic Consciousness) has 
the key of everyone's mind. Only He has the key, and no one else. 
Whenever He likes, He can take away any capacity at any time. If a man 
holding a Ph.D. can speak three langu ages, He can take away the 
capacity for speaking one or two or all three languages, as He likes. So 
what should a human being do? He should surrender to Parama 
Purusha.... Kinshuk, touch the lower middle portion of this boy's back 
with my stick. (Kinshuk does so.) Is the twitching pain now finally gone? 

FULL-TIMER: Yes, Baba! 

BABA: In fact there is no will power in the protoplasmic cells of 
plants, animals and human beings. For the expression of will power, the 
periphery of the doer "I" feeling must be greater than the periphery of 
the done "I" feeling. Nevertheless, you should not forget that the will 
power of Parama Purusha is omnipresent-even within your smallest 
protoplasmic cells. 

Capitalism won't do 

During a reporting session: 

BABA: GS Dada, come forward. Now, just walk across the room in 
the manner of a procrastinator. (The General Secretary begins to walk 
slowly, then hesitates, then walks again, looks around, hesitates, walks a 
little more, and so it continues. We all laugh.) Yesss. GS Da is walking 
just like the procrastinating progress of capitalism. You know, poor 
people cannot contest elections in capitalist countries, for the simple 
reason that one needs to run up a high bill in any successful campaign. 
Will such capitalism, will such so-called democracy, solve the aching 
problems of the people in due time? 

Part of Baba's speech to a group of Margi doctors: 

"As physicians, you must start service cooperatives. These are neither in 
the arena of producers nor consumers co-ops. Rather they are 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


318 


a subtle form of cultural co-ops. These can be called Physicians' Service 
Co-ops. Doctors should research microvita, both positive and negative, 
although they are more concerned with negative. 93 Each and every 
day, several diseases come to this planet through inferential media from 
different celestial bodies. In the course of study, you should find out 
whether there can be a coincidence between the characteristics of 
metazoic cells and multi-cellular protozoic cells in the realm of physi- 
cality and in the psychic sphere. This will help you to find medicines for 
newer and newer diseases. You are not acquainted with many diseases 
which are yet to come to this planet. If you do this research, you will find 
medicines for those ailments yet to come. 

"In the future, neither Communist mania nor philosophical phobia, 
but humanity and intellectuality will rule the earth." 

Will-power Parama Purusha style 

BABA: Kashishvarananda, hold out your right hand. Now, 
Keshavananda, you smell his hand. What do you smell? 

KESHAVANANDA: Sandalwood, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell it again.... What do you get? 

KESHAVANANDA: This time it's jasmine, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell his back.... What is it? 

KESHAVANANDA: Rose, Baba. (I am a few meters away, but even I 
smell it now. It is very sweet. I suppose everyone is catching it.) 

BABA: Shall we allow the smell to continue? If we do, then when 
Kashishvarananda goes for missionary work, the public and Margis will 
wrinkle their noses and say, "Where is that smell coming from?" (LookÂ¬ 
ing at two Dadas on the side of the room who were unable to answer a 
previously asked philosophical question:) You boys, which scent do you 
want to come from your backs? 

TWO DADAS: Whatever Parama Purusha wants. 


93 For thousands of years yogis have declared consciousness to be the fundamental element of 
all entities. Only Baba, however, went into detail on this subject and clearly explained the 
concept of microvita. Microvita are subtle living emanations of the Cosmic Consciousness. They 
serve as the building blocks of matter and life Though several books by Baba and M argis 
elaborate the subject of microvita, they remain a mystery which is gradually unfolding through 
various sorts of research. A footnote cannot adequately explain microvita. 



319 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


BABA: Their answer is an intelligent one. This is a demonstration of 
will-power Parama Purusha-style. 

After we left the room, the sweet rose scent on Kashishvarananda 
was still perceivable by anyone who cared to approach his back. 

I don't remember the cause of Baba's comment during the reporting 
session. I think it was regarding a newspaper article which quoted a 
government minister bragging that the tax-payers had saved much by 
the cancellation of a construction plan. Baba said: 

"It reminds me of Sharmaji's wife's reply. While coming home from 
work, Sharmaji ran after the bus and just missed it. He continued runÂ¬ 
ning, almost caught up, when again it drove away. In the same way, he 
missed it again and again. At last, Sharmaji walked in the door of his 
house and announced to his wife, 'A big part of our financial problems 
are solved. I ran after the bus, missed it again and again, until I finally 
arrived homeâ€”thus saving my bus money.' Mrs Sharma replied, 'I'm 
disappointed. Why didn't you run after a taxi and save more money?"' 

An interesting story is circulating here. A few days ago, one Dada 
went to a village in northern India where no other worker had previÂ¬ 
ously gone. He found many people already practicing Baba Nam 
Kevalam meditation. When he inquired who had taught them, he was 
introduced to a poor, illiterate villager. This man had been a devotee of 
Krishna and Shiva, but he thirsted for a proper guru. Because he could 
not travel, he prayed for the guru to come to him. Baba appeared at his 
house, and initiated him with a mantra and technique, exactly according 
to our system. Baba also taught him all the 16 Points practices of 
Ananda Marga, including tandava and kaoshikii dances. Then Baba 
instructed him to teach Baba Nam Ko/alam meditation throughout the 
surrounding villages. The point of interest is that Baba was in Calcutta 
all the time. 

Soon afterward, this Margi began teaching this simple meditation to a 
few other villagers. He also spoke out against idol worship and castism 
which created a large number of enemies for him in the strict Hindu 
community. One Hindu severely beat him with a stick. The Margi yelled 
at him, "Now surely God will punish you." As the beating con 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


320 


tinued, a snake appeared and bit the Hindu. The Hindu dropped the 
stick and ran to the village center where there was a doctor and also a 
black-magic Tantric. The doctor had no antidote so the black Tantric 
tried to use a mantra, but the poison remained. As the man's body 
turned progressively bluer, the black Tantric told him, "Your only 
chance for recovery lies in your returning to the Margi for his blessing." 
He ran back to the Margi and was told to dance kiirtan, singing Baba 
Nam Ks/alam, with his arms held upward. He did as instructed and 
gradually the blue color gradually left his body, but remained in his 
fingertips. Then the Margi said, "If you take a vow from the heart to 
propagate Ananda Marga, the rest of the poison will leave." The Hindu 
did so and became cured. After this incident, hundreds of villagers 
learned meditation. 

After the Dada returned with this story, two other Dadas were sent to 
the area and confirmed its veracity. Today, Baba was asked for His 
comment, but He only smiled. 94 

Anandamurtiji came to serve the masses 

There was heavy flooding when we arrived at our Tiljala headquarÂ¬ 
ters yesterday. It had been raining heavily since yesterday afternoon. 
Baba arrived only that morningâ€”perfect timing. From the main road to 
our office it is a distance of about one kilometer; I had to walk with my 
luggage on my head. The water level was up to my waist. As I was 
entering, there was a stream of villagers leaving, temporarily abandonÂ¬ 
ing their homes, taking with them whatever belongings and food they 
could manage. 

When I reached our building, some villagers were seeking safety 
from the rain in our four-story office. The Dadas told them they would 
soon be arranging relief materials, but there was no more space in the 
building. It was true. The place was packed with about 500 Margis due 
to various meetings Baba had called. 

Soon after, our electricity and water systems stopped functioning. The 
water level rose up to my chest. We had not prepared any special food 
stocks, and that evening we consumed the last of our meager supplies. 


94 There are many other stories of Baba appearing in two places at once. I hope other 
workers and Margis will write their own books about Baba, and mention their personal 
experience on this subject.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


No one can enter the area now except by swimming or rowboat. 
Boats, of course, are very few. 

With all this trouble, one might expect a tense atmosphere among the 
workers and Margis. But the level of inspiration seems higher than 
usual; everyone is taking it as an interesting test. 

From the moment I came, Baba has been holding meetings in His 
house as usual. To get there I have to swim, and the water is filthyâ€”an 
oil slick covers the surface. I keep a dry uniform in a plastic bag under a 
chair in His house. During the meetings, He never refers to the flood or 
our present difficulties. For Him, difficulties is something normal. 

Outside of our meetings, He takes hourly reports on the progress of 
our relief programs for the village people. At first we didn't even have 
food for ourselves. Then a small boatload of beaten rice and unrefined 
sugar arrived. This has been our only food. Our relief workers are proÂ¬ 
viding the same food to the flood victims, and also helping them set up 
temporary shelters on the road. By this evening, the number of recipiÂ¬ 
ents increased to 18,000. Government assistance has still not arrived. 

Three days later. This afternoon the rain finally stopped. Most of us 
stood on the roof as we watched Baba board a boat, which then slowly 
negotiated its way between the flooded houses. A few Dadas swam 
beside the boat. At that very moment the sun came out; it was beautiful. 
A thought passed through my mind: Anandamurtiji came to serve the 
masses. Even the poorest of the poor will reap the benefit. 

A dog joined the Dadas swimming near the boat. When they shooed 
him away, he climbed onto a rooftop sticking out of the water. From this 
vantage he wagged his tail and watched Baba. 

A few thousand villagers stood on the road watching Baba's boat. For 
most of them, it was the first chance to get a close look at this man 
whose fame had spread throughout the world. As His boat pulled up and 
He stepped out, the villagers maintained complete silence, holding their 
hands together in namaskar pose. Everyone's eyes were glued on the 
People's Guru. The dog too was caught in this collective trance. Only at 
the moment that Baba slipped out of view behind a bus, did the dog stop 
wagging his tail and retire from his post. 

Baba had instructed some of the workers, including me, to follow 
Him after the relief work was regularized to His other house in central 
Calcutta. 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


322 


Next day. We are now in central Calcutta. I heard that at last the 
government's relief team arrived in Tiljala. The villagers were so frusÂ¬ 
trated with the slowness of government help that they shouted, "We 
would have died without the assistance of Ananda Marga!" To demonÂ¬ 
strate their anger, they dumped the first delivery of government food 
into the flood waters. 

Two days later. We sometimes hear suspicions voiced regarding the 
source of Ananda Marga's finances. So how did we get money for these 
relief operations? Food, medicine and miscellaneous assistance for 
18,000 flood victims is no small matter. 

Though our relief department promised the public their minimum 
necessities, our relief teams had almost no money in the beginning. 
Practically speaking, the guarantees we made to serve the needy public 
fully depended on Baba's grace. That might seem foolish, but we had 
faith that He would provide what was required. The team leader, Dada 
Ramananda, personally approached Margis and workers for donations 
from the first to the last day. A few days ago, I gave him as much as I 
could, but when he left my room, he said, "It's still far from enough. I 
really don't know how we'll manage tomorrow." When I saw him the 
next day, he smiled at me. "Yesterday, shortly after I met you, I ran into 
one of the richer villagers, who owns a car which we saved from the 
flood waters. I expressed our financial problems, and he gave me 
enough money for an entire day's supplies. In relief work, we are forced 
to count on at least one or two miracles a day." 

I mproving agricultural and industrial production 

Dada Vijayananda gave a class today explaining many of Baba's 
suggestions about how to increase agricultural and industrial producÂ¬ 
tion, especially in developing countries. Excerpts from my notes not 
only provide some practical ideas, but also show Baba's concern for 
overcoming poverty. 95 

[Author's note: These notes are somewhat detailed. Interested readÂ¬ 
ers are referred to the article "On increasing agricultural production" in 
the appendix Technical talks by Baba or with Baba. At the end of 


95 Later a book was printed of Baba's agricultural ideas called Ideal Farming. 



323 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


this class were a few points of general interest regarding improving the 
industrial output in poor regions:] 

Baba supports the idea of synthetic fibers. He warns that Bengal will 
soon be in danger because it is too dependent on jute fiber and animal 
hide. Due to synthetic fibers, the jute industry will soon be a thing of the 
past. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Baba 
explained that it is better to convert to the production of jutewool. 
Jutewool is a combination of jute and wool. He does not appreciate the 
slogan from the days of Mahatma Gandhi â€” "science is the monster of 
civilization." Rather, for all those in danger of losing their jobs Baba 
proposed a demand: "Let every sub-division have a jutewool industry, 
and let the weavers be supplied with power looms. Thereby both the 
farms and the weavers will receive the proper wages." 

In India paper is expensive because it is imported. To improve the 
paper industry, He gave a list of twenty good plants. These include bamÂ¬ 
boo, different kinds of grass, and mesta jute sticks. 

Bran is usually wasted simply as a fuel. Part of the bran is good for 
manufacturing oil, and the rest should be used as an element in making 
cement (along with lime). 

Until now politics has dominated the economy. But economics 
should dominate politics. If any politician does little to improve the 
people's living standard, then he should be dismissed. 

[Author's note: A few days later, Baba gave a number of points to 
which all Margi district in-charges must pay attention when making 
their planning. These points may be found in the article "Grassroots 
planning", located in the appendix Technical talks by Baba or with 
Baba.]

Working 24 H ours a Day 

Saving plants 

Delhi, 1989. Today, as I arrived at the airport with three large boxes 
containing my sector's quota of 600 plants , I was compelled to undergo 
a complex customs process. 96 Two officials insisted that twelve of my 
plants were forbidden by law. Because these happened to be my most 
expensive plants, I was sure they were lying, with the intention of selling 
the plants afterwards. Officers commonly indulge in this sort of 
corruption. My argument to keep the plants thus fell on deaf ears. 

They had already removed the expensive plants, and I was awaiting 
their final okay to leave. When their backs were turned, I silently exÂ¬ 
changed cheap plants for the expensive ones. A moment later, they 
handed me the authorization. As quickly as possible, I made my way 
through the rest of customs, and jumped into a taxi. Just as the taxi was 
pulling out, I noticed one of the officials run out and anxiously look 
around. 


â€œSince 1981, each of the eight sectors outside of the Indian sector, and each of the ten regions 
inside of the i ndian Sector was required to deposit about 600 plants monthly with the Calcutta 
office. In addition, each time any worker reported to Calcutta, she or he was required to 
personally deliver a number of extra plants. In total, about 13,000 plants were brought every 
month. 

The plants were not brought arbitrarily, but according to specific lists provided by Central 
Headquarters. These included seedlings and small cuttings of flowers, vegetables, medicinal 
herbs, fibers, spices, cosmetic plants, plants on the verge of extinction, fruit trees and other trees. 
For example, at the time of this entry, Hong K ong sector was requested to bring Acasia 
Triacantus, Taiwan Calmanis. Serissa Foetida, Yellow Palm, CalamisFormosana, Cryptomeria 
I apanica, and J apanese Cherry. Calcutta would then distribute the plants to different M aster 
Units of I ndia, and to some extent overseas. Now our botanical gardens rank among the largest 
of India.

Languages of the world 

[Author's note: In todayâ€™s workers' meeting, Baba spoke at great 
length about languages around the world. He frequently spoke on this 
subject. Even when speaking about something else, He commonly went 
on linguistic detours, explaining the derivation of important words. I 
include these notes not because they are exceptional, but to give an 
example of a lecture on His pet subject.. However, the matter is highly 
technical and so the reader is referred to the article "On the evolution of 
languages throughout the world" in the appendix Technical talks by 
Baba or with Baba.] 

Philosophy becomes reality 

Calcutta. A few days ago, while taking the train from Delhi, I sat next 
to Dada Devashraddhananda, who is working in the USA. Though he is 
a dynamite worker, he couldn't help but mention to me about his health 
problems. He said, "I'm suffering so much for so long, I don't know how 
I can take it any longer. Why doesn't Baba free me from this hectic 
lifestyle of constant touring and post me to supervise a farm on a Master 
Unit, or something like that?" 

"Why do you worry?" I said. "Baba knows everything, and is treating 
you and all of us perfectly. When He wants to cure you, He will. 
Otherwise we have to simply keep tasting the fruits of your past actions, 
whether they be sweet or sour." I knew my words were blunt, but here 
was an elevated man who would understand my meaning. 

"You're just speaking philosophy," he said, "and I'm suffering." 

Hearing this, what could I say? 

After we came in Guru's presence, Devashraddhanandaji's attitude 
changed. Smiling, laughing, enjoying Babaâ€”He seemed unaware of his 
own suffering. 

Baba called me out of line to answer a few questions. Then He also 
called Devashraddhanandaji forward. After two or three questions, 
Baba's mood suddenly changed. "Devashraddhananda, stand straight. 
Do you know that there is a defective functioning of your urinary tract?" 

"Yes, Baba." (Later, Dada told me he hadn't really known, but was 
only saying so.) 



Working 24 Hours a D/\ y 


"You should take only liquid diet in the evening. Do you 
understand?" "Yes, Baba." 

Baba told us to step back, and continued the session. I looked at 
Devashraddhanandajiâ€”he was beaming a million rupee smile. 

Criteria for board member 

Baba was listening to the report of one of the workers' boards : 97 
BABA: During the last one month, this board did nothing significant. 
Should a chair or a table be a member of this board? What do you say? 

DADA WHO IS MEMBER OF THE BOARD: Perhaps we achieved 
nothing, Baba, but we were active, and we met regularly. 

BABA (getting a little angry): What do you mean to say? Should a 
ceiling fan be a member of the board? 

F rom the perspective of P rout 

Today Baba expressed some points on Prout. There may be some 
small mistakes in my notes: 

Regarding the case of Salaman Rushdie's book Satanic Verses, i.e., 
Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini demand for Rushdie's death because of the 
book's criticism of Islam and Mohammed, Baba commented: 

Prout does not support the suppression of any popular sentiment. If 
it is suppressed then some people may think there is some value in it. 
Hence suppression only helps to keep the idea alive, and it will manifest 
in different ways later. If the Proutists believe that a particular popular 
sentiment is harmful to the path of human progress, they should 
encourage the idea to be brought into the public light so that it may be 
countered by logic and reason. A constructive alternative should be 
presented. Thus negative energy is channeled in a positive way. Of 
course, this does not deny the importance of legal defamation 
guidelines. 

Regarding the economic development of a nation, Baba gave six points: 
l) Maximum industries should be developed in local areas according to 
the availability of raw materials for local consumption. (This is 


97 This brief conversation is included as an example of a Baba-style criticism during review- 
meetings. 



327 Travels with the Mystic Master 

diametrically opposed to the present policy of every country in the 
world.) 

2 ) Finished products which can he locally produced should not be 
imported. 

3) No country should invest significantly in industries which depend on 
imported raw materials. 

4 ) The first step to decentralized planning is to make an economic 
plan according to the needs of the lowest level, i.e. block-level 
planning for areas having about 100,000 people. 

5) In pure economic terms, developmental promts are those 
projects which directly and indirectly increase nations wealth. 

6) The more government revenue is spent on development projects, 
not including the salaries of government employees, the better it is 
for the country's economy. 

[Author's note: At this point, Baba went on to give a detailed 
explanation regarding the way for Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest 
nations, to solve its economic problems. Refer to the aricle "On solving 
Bangladesh's economic problems" in the appendix Technical talks by 
Baba or with Baba.] 

Go on thinking deeply 

[Author's note: During a workers' meeting, Baba asked me some 
ques- tions about microvita, the mysterious emanation of the Cosmic 
Mind. I tried my best to answer, and He gave some hints for further 
contemplation of this complex subject. About two weeks later, 1 was in 
Taiwan. It was 3:00 in the morning, and I was struggling to stay awake 
while answering the questions of one of our Margi scientists. Suddenly I 
had a long stream of thoughts on the same subject. These diary entries 
are combined into the article "On microvita" in the appendix Technical 
talks by Baba or with Baba.] 

Forever with H im 

For about one year, access to Baba has much more limited. 
Previously, Baba's door was usually open during meetings and reporting 
sessions. Those who couldn't fit inside His room would stand outside, 
looking in. During this past year, however He has allowed the door to stay 
open only once or twice a day. At all other times, we have 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


had to communicate with Him by yelling under His door. In one way it is 
humorous; in another it's painful. 

Humorous? Well, take the moments when He becomes angry (which 
are not infrequent). Atonement is required for those workers who fall 
short of their targets or for any number of other logical or illogical 
reasons. In such cases, the General Secretary should beat the worker 
with a stick. In fact what happens is that, yes he beats alright, but he 
beats any notebook or book that the "guilty" Dada holds, while that Dada 
makes crying and sighing sounds. Pretending to be tormented by the 
whipping, the Dada yells "Oh, Baba!," "I shall improve," "We'll open an 
orphanage within one week," or whatever is the appropriate reply. Baba 
sometimes shouts back: "Does he repent, GS?," "Scoundrel!," "How does 
he intend to rectify the situation?," and so on. Commonly, however, He 
remains silent while the drama proceeds at a Tantric pace. If the 
excitement fades away, He may pipe up, "Eh, GS? What does that 
nonsense fellow have to say for himself?" 

To an outsider it would seem absurd. But for us, because we unÂ¬ 
derstand at least a little of the purpose behind the drama, we tolerate itâ€” 
or, as in my case, even enjoy it. 

A few days ago, I saw Dada Asiimananda (Central Farm secretary, 
one of our most elevated and respected monks) sitting alone outside 
Baba's door. While Baba was shouting a long series of directives under 
the door, Dada would occasionally reply through that same crack, "Yes, 
Baba!," while he was busy consuming a snack. He had obviously adapted 
to the pressure. He had also found a way to adjust with being so busy 
that he had no time for a meal. 

Personally I feel nostalgic for those days when the beating was genuÂ¬ 
ine. It generated a perceivable tension, a smellable fear, which hung in 
the airâ€”and that added to the seriousness of our work. I suppose Baba 
now wants our motivation to depend less and less on external pressure. 
We must derive our inspiration from our hearts, while feeling the 
pressure of our conscience. 

Nowadays the non-Central workers, like me, are usually invited to 
come near Baba's door only a few minutes a day, and occasionally to 
enter. So I am constantly seeking to find new justifications for being 
near His door. For example: "I must speak to my Central departmen 



329 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


tal secretary," or "I was told by so-and-so to wait here â€”What?â€”No, I 
don't know why." At other times, like today, I run out of excuses and 
resort only to melancholic contemplation. My eyes becoming watery and 
doe-like and I mutely turn them on any Dada who challenges me for 
violating protocol. Though these Dadas have great responsibilities, they 
are still fundamentally devotees, so the doe-eyes often silence them. 

It was 1:30 p.m., and for some unknown cause most workers were 
away from the Cosmic nucleus. Even those who were present had 
slipped away for lunch. Only one other Dada, Ganadevanandaji, reÂ¬ 
mained with me outside the closed door. 

When Baba rang His call-bell, His personal assistant, Dada 
Keshavananda, ran from his office, opened the door, popped his head in, 
and said, "Yes, Baba." Baba said nothing. The other Dada and I, 
crouched at the feet of Keshavanandaji, had a clear view of Him resting 
on His side, facing us. He appeared to be sleeping. He's so beautiful, I 
thought, like the tiniest baby. 

"Yes, Baba!" Keshavanandaji said again. When no reply came, he 
slowly and noiselessly shut the door. 

"You two should not be here," he whispered. 

"Ah ... but, Dada ... couldn't you? ... just this time? ..." My eyes 
watered, Ganadevanandaji's mouth quivered, and we each held one of 
Dada's hands. 

Though it was one of our best performances to date, he shook his 
head. "No, no, I can't allow it. You know the system." 

Slowly, ever so slowly, with expressions of heart-wrenching anguish, 
we began edging backwards, away from the Cosmic Door. KeshavaÂ¬ 
nandaji stood his ground, waiting to see that we would really leave. 

When we were just on the verge of leaving, the sound of the call-bell 
cut the air. Keshavanandaji reopened Baba's Door. "Yes, Baba?" 

By this time we were again huddled at the Doorway, staring into the 
king's chamber. His position was the same, His innocent face a bare two 
meters away from us. Again Keshavanandaji called, again no response, 
again without a sound he shut the mystic entrance. 

And again he turned on us, "You shameless fellows!" he yelled in a 
whisper. We smiled glumly, not showing our teeth, mentally pleading 
for mercy. 

"No. Out. Out!" 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


330 


Our heads and shoulders bent, feet dragging like lead, we tortoised 
our way toward the stairway. Step by step, inch by inch, slowly, slowly- 
dreading to face-the other world.... 

And then again! Saved by the bell. "What is this?" Keshavanandaji 
muttered. In a? flash we were nestled behind his feet as he opened the 
gateway to paradise. 

"Baba, kill " he said loudly. There He lay, more peaceful than ever, 
unresponsive to Dada's worn-out query. Dada turned his eyes toward 
heaven, then looked at us. "Alright. Call me the moment that Baba 
wakes up. I don't know what His game is today." He walked away, 
leaving the Door open! 

Baba, thank you.. . I thought. Hardly believing our luck, but underÂ¬ 
standing "His game", we sat down comfortably. Of course, His game was 
that we should have his uninterrupted darshanâ€”to see Him without the 
slightest distraction of reports or talks or background chatter, without 
even the slightest movement or change inside the room. We gazed at His 
face, at His hands, at His bodyâ€”and entered into an indescribable, 
transcendent dimension. My ego-centered mind drifted away, replaced 
by a long peaceful wave of tranquillity. Deeper, deeper, I became lost in 
the thought of Him; nothing remained of me. 

After what seemed like measureless time, something stirred within 
me, like a thin, almost invisible shadow. A feeling arose, increased and 
surged upward from my stomach, tearing at my heart. Tears flowed in a 
steady stream, my mouth grimaced uncontrollably, my body shook, and 
my mind screamed, Baba! Baba! Meanwhile, He lay there, yet unÂ¬ 
movingâ€”affecting me more by His silence than by anything He might 
say or do. Every muscle, every nerve tensed, as waves of emotion 
wracked my being. I struggled not to shout, not to move, and not to 
faint. My feelings rushed like tidal waves; the blood throbbed against my 
temples; and my brainâ€”what words should I use?â€”my brain swooned, 
demanded relief.... I could not think, but I knew, / am with Baba, have 
been so forever, and will be so forever. 

"Okay, Dadas," a soft voice said. "You've been here almost two 

hours." 

I looked upland saw Keshavanandaji. He smiled tenderly, knowingly. 
I didn't resist. As I got up, my legs trembled, unable to hold my weight. I 
held onto the wall. Ganadevanandaji also stood up. Baba, 



331 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


who all this while had faced us unmoving, now rolled over to His other 
side, turning away from us. It was a perfect ending as Keshavanandaji 
gently closed the Cosmic Gate. 

Once downstairs and outside, we looked at each other. What did he 
experience? we each thought. But neither of us asked nor spoke. W e 
only smiled, and arm-in-arm walked silently down the road toward the 
coconut-water man. 

H is responsibility beyond the earth 

Today while I was sitting outside Baba's door, I asked a senior Indian 
worker, Dada Shubbhabodhananda, to tell me the most special 
experience he'd had of Baba. This was his story: 

"It was one year ago during a DMC tour in India. As the secretary 
general of the Service Department, it was my duty to oversee the secuÂ¬ 
rity arrangements. One morning, at 3:00,1 woke up and decided to 
check everything. First I made sure that the two guards were both vigiÂ¬ 
lant. Then I walked around to the rear of the house. Baba's room was 
there, and the window looking into His room had the curtains drawn 
back somewhat. I looked in, but He wasn't there. Hmmm. Perhaps He 
had gone to the bathroom? I walked over to the bathroom window and 
listened. Nothing. Very peculiar. Where could Baba have gone? I walked 
back to the big window of His bedroom, but He still was not there. For 
some minutes I stood there gazing in the window, wondering and 
wondering. 

Suddenly I became aware of the slight shadow of a figure in the 
center of the room. As I watched, the vague shape became more and 
more definite. It was a man sitting in meditation. Finally I realized it 
was Baba. Where there had previously been nothing, He materialized. 

The next morning I was full of curiosity, hoping for some opportuÂ¬ 
nity to ask Baba about the night before. Baba called me in alone to 
perform massage. Shortly after I began, He asked, "Do you have some 
question?" 

"Baba, last night, You know I was there. What was that?" He smiled 
and said, "Do you think I only have responsibility on this one planet?"

The trouble is mutual 

Ananda Nagar. Today Dada Svarupanandaji (the principal of our 
college here and one of our most senior Dadas) told me a couple of 
stories from his early days in Ananda Marga: 

After my initiation, but before I became an acharya, I visited the yoga 
center of the famous elderly lady saint Ananda Mayi Ma. At that time, 
Baba was not well known, so I did not inform anyone there that I was a 
Margi. 

I sat together with the other devotees in front of Ma. She called me 
forward, and said, "You are very lucky. Anandamurti is the greatest guru. 
As for me, I will not be able to go to Him for a long long time." 

I was shocked by her psychic ability to know my guru, and thrilled by 
her praise of Baba. "I can convey your namaskar to Him if you wish," I 
said. 

"Thank you. It is my wish." 

Later, when I met Baba, and passed Ananda Mayi Ma's namaskar. 

He returned the namaskar, and commented, "Yes. She is a good girl." 

Another occasion, also before I was an acharya, I was together with 
Baba at night. Though we were walking, His mind was obviously far 
away. Taking advantage of His transcendental state, I stole two rupees 
from His pocket. Afterward, I used that money to buy sweets and 
brought them to the tiger's grave where three of us sat with Baba. We all 
enjoyed the sweets. Then Baba said to me, "You are only a student, and 
couldn't afford these sweets. I'll give you the money." I replied, "No, 
Baba, it wasn't my money... I stole it from You." Baba looked at me 
sternly and said, "From Guru you stole? You must be punished.... But I 
cannot give you punishment because I also indulged in the stolen goods." 

During those early years, (Svarupanandaji continued) one could 
often see Him enter into trances and different special states of being, just 
like other highly elevated spiritualists. But He is not like others, because 
He never studied under any guru, and He passed through all His 
personal realizations as a youth. After that, I mean for the last thirty 
years or so, He always appeared in total control of Himself-even though 
He's busy raising the kundalini force (spiritual energy) of so many other 



333 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


people. And busy making trouble for us. Well, of course, we're also 
nicely skilled in making trouble for Him. 

M icrovita demo 

Exactly seventeen years ago I first came to this spiritual paradise. I 
have to use the adjective spiritual because it is certainly not a physical 
paradise. Nevertheless, even physically it is far better off than when I 
first saw it. At that time it was a near-desert, without electricity or 
running water, and almost devoid of buildings. Now it is crawling with 
schools, welfare homes, dormitories, medical centers, small industrial 
plants, farm buildings, and offices. Most of these buildings have elecÂ¬ 
tricity and running waterâ€”all provided by our own power plants, 
damns, bio-gas systems and solar cells. About 3000 of the local tribal 
people participate or are employed in construction, cottage industry or 
agricultural development projects in Ananda Nagar. And yet, so far, the 
government has not helped us in the slightest. 

The most impressive change, however, is in the natural environment. 
As I said, it used to be a near-desert. Its small streams would run dry in 
the summer. Now, even in the driest time of the sweltering summer, the 
river is not only running, its water is deep enough for swimming. 
Although in this very moment a severe drought affects all of northern 
India, Ananda Nagar is an oasis, full of green-leafed trees and bushes. 
Rain falls at least on a semi-regular basis. 

How did this happen? I cannot be sure. Is it the special trees and 
plants here, which Baba specified for attracting rain clouds? Or the 
system of rivers and drainage which catches rainwater to avoid its runÂ¬ 
ning into the ground? Or is it some sort of special spiritual grace? 

(During a reporting session:) 

BABA: Any effect may be achieved by causing a concentration of the 
relevant microvita. And those microvita may be transported by any of a 
number of different means. For example ... my boy, step forward. (A 
Dada walks close to Baba.) The microvita causing thermal generation 
may be conveyed by the tactual factor. (Baba uses one finger to touch 
the Dada's anahata chakra or chest.) Now how do you feel, my boy? 
DADA: Very hot, Baba. There are waves of heat. BABA: Acha. (Baba 
touches him again.) And now?

DADA: My body's coming back to normal, Baba. 

BABA: These microvita may also be conveyed by the ocular faculty. 
(As usual, throughout the last few minutes, Baba was hardly looking at 
anyone, even while speaking with particular persons. Now he looks very 
specifically at the Dada.) How do you feel now? 

DADA: I feel super hot, Baba. 

BABA: Do you want to go on enjoying this state? 

DADA: Ah (he smiles, though clearly very uncomfortable)... whatÂ¬ 
ever Baba likes. 

BABA (again looking in an obvious way at the Dada): It would be 
dangerous for your cells to remain in this agitated condition for long. 
That is why I am now withdrawing the microvita. Well? 

DADA: Thank you, Baba. 

BABA: No, no. It was done by your grace alone. 

J umping cure 

The Central Secretary of the Education, Relief and Welfare Section, 
Dada Paripurnananda, is a good friend of mine. Recently, Baba has been 
very hard on him. I feel proud of Paripurnanandaji, because no matter 
what sort of clash Baba gives him, he seems to take it nicely. Now in the 
middle of a scolding, Baba's mood suddenly shifted. 

BABA: I believe you have some problem with your knee. Is it so? 
PARIPURNANANDA (smiles sweetly, enjoying this change in Baba's 
attitude): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: GS Da, apply your hands to his left knee, massaging gently. 
(The General Secretary does so.) Is it somewhat cured now? 

PARIPURNANANDA: Yes, Baba. It is maybe thirty percent better. 
BABA: Now you should leap in the air as high as possible. 
(Paripurnanandaji hesitates a moment, wondering if he understood corÂ¬ 
rectly, as it seems a strange way to cure a knee problem. Then, shrugging 
his shoulders in surrender, he jumps almost one meter up.) Jump again. 
And again. Now, describe the condition. 

PARIPURNANANDA (with an enormous smile): I believe it is one 
hundred percent cured, Baba. 

BABA: Just see, just see. But do I remember hearing one little boy 
thinking, "Baba loves those two other Dadas. He doesn't love me.?" 
Hmmm, did anyone think that? 

PARIPURNANANDA (softly): Yes, Baba, I was thinking so... but... 



335 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


BABA: But what? Is it so that Baba does not love the little boy who 
was thinking so? 

PARIPURNANANDA (looking affectionately at Baba): No. Baba 
loves him very much. 

BABA: Perhaps your assumption is correct. Yes, I think it may be 
correct. 

Global Weatherman 

Calcutta. Dada Pranavatmakananda told me that on 2nd June, durÂ¬ 
ing a workers' meeting, Baba mentioned, "The panorama of the world is 
going to undergo a very fast change. You all should be ready...." 

Yesterday in Vishnupur, Pranavatmakanandaji said to Baba, "Three 
days ago You said the world's panorama is going to undergo a big 
change. Baba, in that time so much happened. On 3rd June, Ayatollah 
Khomeini, the revolutionary mullah of Iran died. On 4th June, ComÂ¬ 
munism was voted out of power in Polandâ€”the first country to reject it. 
Also on 4th June, when the military attacked the peaceful protesters in 
Tiananmien Square, Communism stood exposed in China as a system 
that can only be maintained by brute force. It seems that Your 
prediction of communism's downfall is beginning to be fulfilled." 

"You wait and see," Baba said. "The world will be dumbstruck to 
witness the pace of change. Before you reach your sector, there will be 
much more change in the world." 98 

Real dreams 

Dada Pranavatmakananda toled me a story he heard from two other 
Dadas: Nityasatyanandaji and Haratmanandaji. They were both sleepÂ¬ 
ing in the same room in Sao Paolo, Brazil, when Nityasatyanandaji had a 
dream: 

He was on a field walk with Baba. At one point, their way became 
obstructed by mud. Dada thought, "If Baba walks through this mud, His 
legs will become dirty." So he lifted Baba, carried Him across, and then 
put Him down. Then he woke up. 

He noticed that their room was full of a sweet lotus scent. He was so 
excited that he shook Dada Haratmananda to wake him up and asked 


98 Pranavatmakanandaji reached his sector a few months later. During that time, Communism 
collapsed in the whole of E astern Europe. 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


336 


him, "Do you smell anything in this room?" Dada replied, "Yes ... it's like 
a lotus flower ... very sweet." After this, both Dadas forgot about the 
incident. 

Nine months later, Nityasatyanandaji was in Calcutta. It was his 
daily routine to wait for Baba in the garden. When Baba would come out 
of the house, Dada would sing the latest Prabhat Sangiit song. One day 
Baba turned toward him and said, "If you had not lifted me that day, my 
legs would have become dirty." He smiled and walked away. 
Nityasatyanandaji was surprised. He went on singing but could not unÂ¬ 
derstand what Baba meant. He remembered nothing. 

Two days later when Dada was returning to South America, he sudÂ¬ 
denly recalled that night and understood Baba's words. He wept with 
love for Baba. 

At another time, Haratmanandaji was alone with Baba, massaging 
Him. Somebody had told him that Baba's navel area produced a special 
scent. When Baba was sleeping, Haratmanandaji lifted Baba's unÂ¬ 
dershirt out of curiosity. Baba woke up and said, "Nonsense fellow! 
What are you doing?" 

Again He slept. More careful this time, Haratmanandaji lifted the 
undershirt. Baba woke up while Dada was sniffing. But this time He 
smiled and asked, "What do you smell?" 

"It's sweet, Baba." 

"Is it like a lotus?" 

"Yes." 

"Have you seen pictures of the mythological Vishnu which show a 
lotus sprouting from his navel, and on top of the lotus flower Brahma is 
sitting, creating the whole universe?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"It is symbolic. Parama Purusha (the Supreme Consciousness) creÂ¬ 
ates all, and His nucleus, His creative faculty is the navel. As His navel 
produces a lotus smell, mythology shows it so. Do you remember this 
scent?" 

"What do you mean, Baba?" 

"Do you remember when you were sleeping in the same room as 
Nityasatyanandaji, and he woke you up? It was exactly that smell." It is 
clear that for Baba, our dreams of Him are also part of reality.

Lost in their own lies 

[Author's note as a background to today's entry: In 1982 the Tripura 
state government, at that time communist, tried to crush Ananda 
Marga. Some of their leading politicians openly stated they would "oust 
the socio-political organization Ananda Marga." Soon after, one of our 
primary schools was bombed. A court case was filed and the judge's deÂ¬ 
cision went against us so we appealed in the High Court. At that time, 
the communists held 54 seats in the State Assembly out of 60. Most of 
the public used to treat Chief Minister Chakravorty like a god. How 
could we expect to win? But Baba said at that moment, "When the 
sinner reaches the climax point, downfall is certain." We sent 500,000 
leaflets and 200,000 posters to this small state of less than two million 
inhabitants. Finally in the High Court, the District Magistrate apoloÂ¬ 
gized for obstructing our school. The High Court instructed the police 
and the government agents to leave our school undisturbed. Not long 
after, the communist government was defeated by the Congress Party. 

The West Bengal government's (also communist) reaction to our 
work in Ananda Nagar was similar. In 1987, Baba told us, "The wind is 
blowing in your favor." He also said, "Complete every work immediately, 
as time is short." Highest priority went to developing Ananda Nagar. In 
short time, the near-desert scene dramatically changed. It must have 
terrified the federal and state governments to see Ananda Marga 
creating a beautiful community in one of the poorest areas of India. If 
we succeeded, it would prove the government's inefficiency and 
insincerity. The local communist party leader announced to the press, 
"Just as we drove out the Lutheran Universalist Mission, we will also 
drive out Ananda Marga."] 

In Ananda Nagar this year there have been almost daily attacks on 
our staff, destruction of our agricultural work or harm to our buildings. 
Ananda Nagar is about 1200 acres, and these attacks have mostly 
occurred on the outskirts. Four months ago, at midnight, the police 
destroyed one of our buildings, declaring it the property of the Forestry 
Department. The police claimed they seized weapons from Ananda 
Marga. We denied it. They often make such claims. We are compelled to 
repeatedly file court charges, and eventually always win. It seems a 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


338 


never-ending process. By now, the general people doubt any negative 
news published about us. In this case, our statement in the court was, 
"Why didn't the police destroy the building in the daytime, if it were 
really the government's building?" We won the case. 

The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu, became furious-he 
openly hates Ananda Marga. The step he decided on was excessive. 
Yesterday he approved an attack hoping to drive out Ananda Marga. The 
District Magistrate sent a message to Jyoti Basu, "If we raid Ananda 
Nagar, we can expect a fight just like the Sikhs waged at the Golden 
Temple." They sent 1500 police and 153 vehicles to Ananda Nagar. They 
even brought ambulances to take care of the wounded. Apparently there 
was so much propaganda against us for so long, that the opposition 
believed their own lies about us. They thought we had a huge number of 
machine guns and explosives. But what did this overwhelming military 
force find? Nothing. Nevertheless, in a press conference just after the 
raid, the police claimed they discovered numerous weapons. 

Today our Public Relations secretary filed a court case against the 
West Bengal government and police. In the history of West Bengal, no 
case was ever filed against top police officers. The PR secretary also held 
a press conference, and showed the police seizure lists which proved 
that they found nothing. The media representatives were astonished; 
they had published the false news only yesterday. Today they printed 
the true story. 

Working 24 hours a day 

During the last few days of reporting, Baba did not sit with the repÂ¬ 
resentatives. Each time He comes back from field walk, everyone greets 
Him as He steps out of the car, then those who have reporting duty run 
into the main room to be ready in case He wants to take their report. 
Though we've regularly followed this procedure, our sense of desponÂ¬ 
dency deepens as the days pass and He seems to ignore us. 

This morning there was a feeling of resignation among many workÂ¬ 
ers. "Surely again He will not sit with us." Our crisp readiness was so 
absent that this time the main room was full of Margis and workers who 
were not supposed to be there, and no one had made any effort to shoo 
them out. 



339 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Together with everyone else, I greeted Baba at His car. As He slowly 
walked away, moving toward the side entrance, one brother approached 
me. "Dada, I've completed the paper-work that you wanted me to do. 
Here it is." I was torn between going through the documents and going 
to the room, just in case this time Baba wanted our report. But if I didn't 
take the papers it might make trouble for this brother. I took the 
material and quickly checked it. In this way, perhaps a minute passed. 

Then I rushed toward the room. A mad scene was taking place at the 
door! Margis and other workers were scrambling to squeeze out, 
everyone trying to get out at the same time. Though I could hear Baba 
shouting inside, there was no way I could enter at that moment. A gap 
appeared, and I jumped forward, pushing violently against the others, 
and forgetting all politeness. Just as I reached the door those inside 
began closing it. I thrust in my arm, and then a leg, and with a burst of 
strength, pressed it open, and squeezed into the room. 

The very instant I entered Baba looked at me, burning me with His 
inner fire. As the last to enter, I was the most irresponsible element in 
this entire brew of feckless workers. But instead of hiding behind the 
others, I stepped toward the front. I love His attention, no matter what 
sort. 

"Nonsense! Stupid! Scoundrel!" He shouted at me. "Breeding chaos! 
Like animals! Idiot! Rascal!" I bathed in His force. "How can you waste 
my time? Don't you know that I am working twenty four hours a day?" 
His words stabbed at me with a power and a volume I had never before 
experienced. Surely even the neighbors could clearly hear His voice 
through the now closed door. The other workers turned their faces toÂ¬ 
ward me, wondering how I would take this scorching chastisement. I 
suppose they thought me arrogant, because instead of bowing my head 
in abasement, I looked straight at Baba. He was dead right, I was someÂ¬ 
times wasting my time and His time, but in that moment I did not care 
because Baba was directing a colossal force at me, and I did not want to 
miss a drop of it. 

He stood up from the sofa. A sinking sense of disappointment surged 
through the workers as they understood that this opportunity for a long- 
awaited meeting with Baba was spoiled. As He left the room everyone 
became gloomy and turned their eyes toward the floor. Every 



Working 24 Hours a Day

one, that is, except me. I was elated with the shakti, the spiritual power 
He had injected into me. But, knowing the others would not understand, 
I neither smiled nor said anything. I was, after all, the one deserving 
maximum blame. 

His voice echoed again and again in my mind: "Don't you know that I 
am working twenty four hours a day?" 

Society's high expectations 

(During the meeting of the district incharges from Area West of the 
Indian Sector. A Margi stands in front of Baba.) 

BABA: GS, ask him how many full-timers he created. 

GENERAL SECRETARY: How many full-timers did you create in the 
last one year? 

MARGI: None. 

BABA (now directing his words at the Margi): How many schools have 
started due to your own efforts? MARGI: None, Baba. 

BABA: And could you even inspire any Margis to become Block 
Secretaries within your district? MARGI: No, Baba. I'm sorry. BABA: 
You're sorry. Are you married? MARGI: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Then why are you also keeping a secret wife? (Some of us 
gasp in surprise. Most surprised is the Margi, who rolls his eyes and is 
no longer able to stand still.) Haram jada! (You donkey!) Because your 
lifestyle is immoral, of course you could not achieve anything. And due 
to your illicit behavior you have also contracted some serious disease. Is 
it not so? 

MARGI: Yes, Baba... 

BABA: Do you promise from this very moment to rectify yourself and 
become an ideal man, serving the society with all of your capacity? 
MARGI: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Come closer. (The Margi moves near Baba, who reaches out and 
momentarily touches him below the navel area.) You are henceforth 
cured of that disease. Do you understand that we, the members of the 
collective society, maintain high expectations regarding the contribution 
that you will make for the universal welfare? 



341 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


MARGI: Yes, 

Baba. BABA: Very 
good. 

When we spoke to him afterward, he refused to tell what disease he 
had, saying only that it was something abominable. Then he went to the 
bathroom. After coming out, he said, "By Baba's grace it is cured!" 

Service beyond party politics 

Today Baba introduced a new program called ARS: All-Round SerÂ¬ 
vice. Henceforth it will be a daily-report item. ARS consists of basic 
relief works to be offered to the most needy people, and will be directed 
primarily at the communist and post-communist countries. Baba 
explained four pointsâ€” 

1) ARS had to be created due to the defective economic subsistence 
level in the communist countries. 

2 ) ARS has nothing to do with party politics.. 

3) We have to help the people down to the district level at the time of 
calamity. 

4 ) We should continue cooperation with other service organizations 
such as Red Cross and Oxfam. 

The Fareast Asia sector has the greatest population of any sector 
suffering under communism. It includes China, Asiatic Russia, 
Mongolia, North Korea and Tibet, so this new emphasis will be very 
important for us. 


An article appeared in the newspaper today about a flood in South 
Korea. Baba, to whom at least four newspapers are read daily, requested 
a report within twelve hours about our relief work. I tried to telephone 
our office in Seoul, but could not get through. 

When the deadline for reporting approached, Baba's personal asÂ¬ 
sistant pressed me for the report. I told him that I couldn't get through, 
but he wouldn't accept this reply. Not knowing what to do, I closed my 
eyes, meditated on Baba's face, and asked Him for guidance. I imagined 
what work we should have done in Korea, and accordingly, on opening 
my eyes wrote the following false report: 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


342 


"In the aftermath of Typhoon Judy, Seoul Regional Secretary (Dada 
Alok) and Universal Proutist Intellectual Federation Secretary (Dada 
Mahaprajinananda) organized a relief team of 12 Margis to help homeÂ¬ 
less and suffering people in the Seoul area. Already clothes have been 
given to 25 families, and food to 200 people. The team also helped to 
clean out and make habitable four houses so far. They will continue their 
work with accelerating speed." 

Soon after the report was submitted, Baba called a meeting in His 
bedroom. During that meeting, He praised Hong Kong Sector for reÂ¬ 
sponding so quickly to the flood in Korea, and encouraged the repreÂ¬ 
sentatives of other sectors to follow this example. On top of that, He 
directed the Central Public Relations Secretary to submit the news of our 
on-going Korean relief work to the Calcutta newspapers. 

I was thoroughly embarrassed, but could tell nobody. All this 
hoopla over a false report. At the end of the session, I immediately took 
permission to go to the city public telephone office. 

This time I got the line to Seoul. Dada Alok answered: 

ME: Alok, it's absolutely urgent that you do something for the people 
suffering from the flood in Korea. Baba read about it in the newspapers. 

ALOK: We already did a bit of relief work. 

ME: Great! I'm writing it down. Tell me who did the work? 

ALOK: About a dozen Margis under the guidance of Mahaprajina- 
nandaji and myself. 

ME: Wow! I was just guessing Mahaprajinanandaji was there. 

ALOK: What? 

ME: Nothing. How many people did you help? 

ALOK: We gave clothes to about twenty-five families, and food to 
about 200 people. 

ME: That's incredible! Absolutely totally Baba Nam Kevalam! Did 
you, by the way, did you clean out any houses? 

ALOK: Yeah. 

ME: Was it about four houses? 

ALOK: No, it was three houses. Wait a moment, come to think of it, it 
was four houses. How did you know? 

ME: I love you, Baba! Somehow Baba knew all this even without the 
telephone call. He's reporting your work to the newspapers already. 



343 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


ALOK: What're you talking about? Really? But it's not such a big deal 
yet. Anyway you can let Him know that there's a lot of people still 
suffering, so we'll do more and more work. 

ME: I already told Him you'll work with accelerating speed. 

ALOK: Exactly. 

ME: We should give some more news to the papers. So try to call me 
with your report tomorrow and the day after also. ALOK: Will do. 

The peculiar business of making saints 

All the other workers were doing meditation, and I alone guessed that 
Baba's door was wide open. I stood there for half an hour, look-ing at Him 
as He talked with Dada Keshavananda. Baba was in a fine mood, laughing 
and joking. Toward the end, Keshavanandaji gave Him a soft drink. Like a 
child, Baba wore a napkin tucked in at His neck, and sipped repeatedly at 
the plastic straw, enjoying Himself. I felt a change in the air, and knew 
something was coming, though they still talked lightly together. Suddenly, 
Baba began shouting loudly, and Keshavanandaji jumped up and ran out of 
the room, calling the Central workers. Baba, alone now, continued shouting. 
Within seconds, they all clambered into His room. Boiling with rage, He 
charged them with numerous crimes. They could hardly reply. Within no 
time, pun- ishment was allocated, and all these senior workers rolled onto 
their backs and into the shoulder stand, their legs pointed up in the air. 
Some of them are old gray haired men. 

As soon as they were so positioned, Baba returned to His drink, as if 
nothing had happened. He spoke mildly with Keshavanandaji, and paid 
absolutely no attention to the score of workers so oddly assembled 
before Him. 

The workers smiled at each other, whispered together, and, knowing 
it would be a long session, secretly leaned their legs against the walls. 

Tears in our eyes 

Today was the last day of this month's reporting so all the secto-trial 
representatives were holding garlands, hoping to get a chance to place them 
on Baba. During these last months He had not directly received any 
garlands, but rather accepted them only through His personal assistant. 

Still, we had hope. 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


344 


After He returned from field walk, we quickly lined up at the side 
door. There are two entrances to the main reporting room: the front 
door, and the side door which Baba uses as He walks upstairs to His 
room. He would not enter the reporting room at this late time. Since 
Fareast Asia â€” Hong Kong Sector â€” is always the first to be called, I 
stood at the front of the line. For some minutes He talked to us. Then He 
turned to go upstairs. We would not be able to put our garlands on 
Him... 

Then abruptly He pivoted, and walked into the reporting room. 
Within a moment He was seated, and I heard Keshavanandaji yell, 
"Hong Kong Sector!" 

The narrow path back around the house to the front was blocked by 
twenty-six workers: two Dadas and one Didi from each of the nine 
sectors. I could not push them aside, but neither could I delay when I 
was being called before Baba. So I jumped. I wonder how I did it, and 
still people ask me about it, but I jumped over this entire crowd of 
workers, and in no time ran through the front door and up to Baba. 
Keshavanandaji smiled broadly and tilted his head, also marveling at 
how I came so fast. 

Without waiting for permission, I placed my garland over Baba's 
head, and draped it on His neck. His eyes glittered. All my excitement 
disappeared as I became lost in His affection. 

"Did you enjoy the program, Dharmavedananda?" 

"Too much, Baba." 

"But do you remember our days together in Berlin Sector?" 

His tone made me start crying. "Just like... it was yesterday... Baba." 

He smiled at me, and kept His eyes on me, though He said nothing. 
His eyes also teared. After some time the magic shifted, and He did 
namaskar to me, tears still shining in our eyes. 

From that moment my state of mind was so altered that I cannot 
remember anything else that happened. 

Y ou will see 

Dada Mantreshvarananda told me that on a recent field walk he had 
the following conversation with Baba: 

DADA: Baba, today the materialists have all the power. They have all 
the manpower, all the wealth, all the technological strength. The 



Travels with the 
Mystic Master 

spiritual-moralists, on the other hand, are but few in number, having no 
wealth, and almost no machinery. Excuse me for asking, Baba, but in 
the face of this reality, how can we expect to see the realization of a 
Proutist government within any reasonable period of time? 

BABA (abruptly turning toward Mantreshvaranandaji): There is no 
one who can stop Prout's progress. It will be established within a very 
short time. (Pointing His finger at Dada) You will see. 

Improving bodies for improved service 

During reporting of Dadas, in the midst of the review of one worker, 
Baba suddenly interrupted him: 

BABA: There is a dull pain in the lower vertebrae of your spine. Is it 
not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Occasionally it flares into acute pain. Is it not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Have you not experienced these symptoms for several years? 
DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA (looking at the General Secretary): GS Da, place your right thumb 
in my palm. (The General Secretary does so, and Baba rubs his thumb 
between His two hands.) What is the feeling in your thumb now? 
GENERAL SECRETARY: It is very hot, Baba. 

BABA: Using that hot thumb, touch the vertebrae in the area of his 
svadhistana chakra (i.e., area of lower back). (Speaking to first Dada:) 

Is that the area of your pain? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: GS, twist and turn your hot thumb ... move slightly higher ... 
yes... now move down the spine ... continue ... yes ... that is enough. 

Now, how do you feel, my boy? 

DADA: I feel full of power. 

BABA: And the pain? 

DADA: It is gone, Baba. 

BABA: It will not return. Now, what plan have you chalked out for 
the use of your improved body? 

DADA: I will do maximum service to the suffering humanity, Baba. 
BABA: Very good. Very good.

Pretending to be normal 

Baba's voice is a nasal one. It is something peculiar. Many people 
like that voice, but I doubt that the public would consider His voice 
especially appealing or magnificent. 

That's why, after hearing Baba's voice for more than ten years, today 
I was surprised. His voice became beautiful and mellow, like a trained 
public speaker. The scene was appropriate for this attractive voice, 
because He spoke to the Prout candidates for state assemblies in India. 

It was as if He wanted to give them an example how to speak to the 
public though He did not say it in so many words. 

A portion of His speech in English: 

"Communism was a Utopian idea never to be materialized on this 
earth. Now most of the countries have recognized this fact. So this is the 
opportune moment for Prout to come. We have to propagate it among 
the intellectuals. The time is come. In each and every corner of the 
earth. In each and every hearth of human soul. For this we need more 
Prout cadres. Forty-eight new wholetimers in India, and forty-eight new 
wholetimers overseas. Help this project. It is not enough, but for the 
time being it may do something. I said twice before, the time is come. 
There is no other philosophy to solve the world's problems and quench 
human thirst. This election proved there is a need and a demand. The 
world wants you. No time is to be lost. There is dire necessity." 

Perhaps each and every action of Baba is calculated for its effect. He 
is a full-time unpaid actor. To imagine that all these years He was 
speaking in an artificial voice. And why did He pick such a nasal sound? 

I can guess that He wanted us to be attracted only by His way of living, 
His ideas, and His sacrifice. 

Perhaps this is why He wears glasses, dresses simply, and appears 
normal. In the early days, before Ananda Marga was well known, it often 
happened in train stations that non-Margis would approach Dadas to 
pay their respects, never even noticing Baba. 

I remember a story from many years ago: 

A certain Margi believed that Baba did not need spectacles, but only 
wore them because His unobstructed gaze was too over-powering. One 
day, this Margi served Baba His meal. When he entered the room, 



THE 


Travels with 
Mystic Master 

he saw Baba reading a newspaper without wearing His glasses. But He 
was holding the paper very close to His eyes. 

The shocked Margi thought, My God! Baba does need glasses! He 
stood there, holding the tray of food, unable to move. Wild thoughts 
entered his mind: perhaps he had over-estimated Baba; perhaps Baba 
was not really powerful; perhaps He was not a true guru. 

After thinking this for some time, he noticed that Baba was holding 
the newspaper upside-down. 

In that moment, Baba lowered the paper, looked at the Margi, and 
smiled. 

Going to Ananda Nagar instead of staying with Baba 

Everyone is alarmed. Baba has experienced some sort of heart failÂ¬ 
ure, and was admitted to the emergency ward of a private nursing home. 
The festive atmosphere of yesterday is now replaced by a gloomy one. 

Next day. Workers and Margis have decided to hold continuous 
kiirtan until Baba is cured. The kiirtan has been super-high. Now again 
everyone is feeling inspired. 

Next day. Just after the kiirtan reached the 24-hour mark, Baba sent 
a message from the nursing home: "All Margis and workers should 
proceed to Ananda Nagar for the winter program. May it be a grand 
success. Keep in mind three points: 1) All Margis should love Ananda 
Nagar. If any don't yet love Ananda Nagar, they should start to love it 
now. 2) Ananda Nagar is the best place for Margis. 3) Every Margi's 
body should touch the soil of Ananda Nagar." 

Though Baba remained away, we had to follow His directives. We 
stopped the kiirtan, and left for Ananda Nagar. 


Five days later. Ananda Nagar. As Baba foretold, our spiritual fesÂ¬ 
tival was "a grand success." About 30,000 Margis attended. Sixty-five 
full-timers and Margis decided to go for acharya training, and twenty 
pieces of land were donated for making model communities.

CHAPTER 20 


H e Sends Out a Clarion Call 

L ittle work and all pleasure 

Calcutta, January 1990. Today, as Baba was leaving the nursing 
home, He called all the nurses "Ma" and distributed sweets to them. 
They all cried. The last person at the door was Baba's doctor, Dr Sen, 
one of India's leading heart specialists. He also treated Mother Teresa. 
He said, "Baba, we all thank You for putting Your holy feet in our 
nursing home. But You are not a man, or even a superman. You are a 
god." Then he prostrated himself at Baba's feet. 

Dada Keshavananda told me that a few days ago the doctors proÂ¬ 
tested that Baba was continuing to compose Prabhat Sangiit songs in 
the emergency ward even though they had requested Him not to do any 
work. In one day alone He wrote thirteen songs. He responded by 
saying, "Composing Prabhat Sangi it does not require any special effort 
from my part. Similarly, whenever I write Shabda Cayanika (His 
encyclopedia), it is a spontaneous expression. Rather than considering 
these processes to be my work, you should title them my pleasures." 

Keshavanandaji asked Baba what He considered to be work. He said, 
"When I conceptualized the idea of Ananda Marga, or Prout, or 
microvita, or Neo-H uman ism â€”these original revolutionary creations 
required a little exertion. You may be interested to know that the work 
which occupied my effort for the longest time was the invention of our 
Pratik (the symbol of Ananda Marga). It took me thirty minutes." 

A few days ago two nurses approached Keshavanandaji with a quesÂ¬ 
tion. They said, "Each of us separately observed Baba talking in His 



349 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


sleep. Both times He said the same words: Master units. Master units. 
Do the words master units have any special meaning that you know?" 

Keshavanandaji laughed. "Yes, I know. The establishment of Master 
Units all over the globe is now our most important program. It is so 
important that Baba goes on creating the conducive psychic wave for 
them even when His body is sleeping." 99 

The last story concerns Dr Ramesh, a specialist at the clinic. One day 
the doctor told Baba, "Your health is not good. But I understand you 
frequently scold your workers. Anger is not helpful to your cure. So I 
request you to refrain from such rebuking." 

Baba became furious, shouting loud enough to cause everyone to 
jump, "Who is he to tell me such a thing!" 

The Dadas became upset, and the doctors became afraid. 

In a twinkle of an eye, Baba again changed His mood, and said 
sweetly, "Now, do you mean like that?" 

"Yes, Baba," said Dr Ramesh, shaking. 

"No need to worry," said Baba. "You see, I say all such caustic words 
from my throat, not from my heart. It does not affect me." 


"TheM aster Unit program is the culmination of all other social service activities of Ananda 
M arga. For simplicity's sake, until this point my diary entries referred to such projects as' 1 land 
communities" or 11 model communities." Ananda Nagar was our first M aster Unit. To be 
considered a M aster Unit, a piece of land must beat least five acres. On this land we must 
establish a yoga/meditation center, agricultural farm, cottage industry, family dwellings, a self- 
contained system of ponds and streams, an alternative energy center, and a permanent service 
center. According to location and various other factors, we should also, if possible, develop a 
children'shomeand school, a wild animal sanctuary, botanical gardens, medical hospital or 
clinic, a dairy farm, and a good number of welfare homes and appropriate industries. Thus, the 
M aster Unit serves as a model community by which the public may practically experience Prout 
in action. Without this demonstration, Prout would be only an interesting theory, and most 
people would not believe that the implementation of Prout is truly possible. The M aster Unit is 
also a training ground to develop the subtle feelings and knowledge required for gaining the 
cooperation and leadership skills upon which a Proutist society is based. 

Though Baba gave the concept of M aster Unit many years before this diary entry, it was only in 
1987 that He began emphasizing it. During the four years beginning with 1987, He gradually 
stepped up the level of concentration on making and developing M aster Units. Eventually, 
almost every Dada and Didi became involved in obtaining land. Throughout the world we now 
own hundreds of properties on which we are developing M aster Unit projects. For example, in 
theFareast Asia sector we have a total of ten M aster Units in Taiwan, K orea, Russia, M ongolia, 
Hong K ong and J apan.

The creator of madness 

The doctors first gave strict instructions, and then pleaded with Baba, 
that He should not work for the next one month. Though it is doubtful 
He can keep Himself away from work for so long, we expect that for a 
few days at least He will abide by these instructions. He will not, for 
example, hold darshan or workers' meetings. Many Margis are here from 
all over the world who are desperate for a glimpse of Baba. Their only 
chance is while Baba takes garden-walks twice daily. It is possible to look 
over the boundary wall and see Him. It is Baba's private time so no one is 
technically permitted to do this, but the rule is generally overlooked 
because the Margis have never been too many at a single time, and 
everyone maintains silence. This stretching of the .rule has gone on for 
years. 

Today there were far more Margis looking over the wall than at any 
other time. There were hundreds, mostly from overseas. The Margis 
literally climbed over each other to secure a vantage points on the wall. 
To see over the wall it is necessary to stand on something, usually piled 
bricks or rocks. The types of structures thus built were varied, and often 
were piled too high, so that they sometimes collapsed, causing many 
people to simultaneously fall to the ground. Though knees and elbows 
were scraped, no one seemed to care. 

In this atmosphere, for the first time, the unwritten rule of mainÂ¬ 
taining silence was broken. The Margis could not control themselves. As 
Baba emerged in a wheelchair, a few weeping sounds and sighs cut the 
silence. Within a few more moments, such a thrill swept through the 
crowd that Margis were crying, laughing, yelling "Baba!," "Namaskar 
Baba!" and so on. Baba smiled. He turned His face toward the Margis, 
and they went wild. A Yugoslavian brother jumped over the wall, and 
was immediately restrained by the security volunteers. I was standing or, 
rather, hanging down from the roof, and had a perfect view of the whole 
scene. It was cinematic, to say the least. 

As Baba concluded the walk, He was wheeled toward the final corner. 
It was a few meters from there that the Yugoslavian brother was being 
held. Suddenly he broke away from the guards, lunged in front of Baba, 
and prostrated at His feet. In the same moment, Baba's closest 
bodyguard, Pratap, leapt forward, and in a single flowing movement 
lifted the brother off the ground and thrust him into the distance. 

Though 



351 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


everyone was excited by this performance, Baba was undisturbed. He 
pretended not even to see it, though it happened immediately before 
Him. 

A moment later, when yet another Margi yelled "Namaskar Baba," 
He spoke to the Margis for the one and only time, saying, "You are all 
doing namaskar to me. One namaskar from me is enough for all." He 
then folded His hands and, turning His body slowly around, did a long 
namaskar toward all the Margis. The effect was like His varabhaya 
mudra, His gesture of blessing during DMC. By their crying and sighing 
it was clear that every Margi felt it. 

Don't make problems out of nothing 

Without reporting sessions to attend, I've time on my hands. ThinkÂ¬ 
ing to inspire a few Margis from my sector, I escorted four of them to 
the Didis' quarters where I requested a meeting with Didi Ananda 
Bharati who everyone affectionately calls Aunty. Aunty is the first Didi 
and also the oldest. She is the sole teacher of kapalika meditation for 
Didis who are authorized by Baba to become avadhutikas. For many 
months she has been so sick that she could hardly leave her room. 

The five of us sat around her bed. 

"How are you, Aunty?" I asked. 

"My T is fine. But, ach, this body should have died some years ago. 
Baba is just keeping it around for His pleasure. Ha, ha!" 

She spoke in such a way that we all laughed with her. Then I asked 
Aunty to tell us some of her experiences with Baba. She did not want to 
tell any, but due to our repeated requests, she narrated a few incidents. 
These stories were mostly sentimental. For example, she said, "I used to 
frequent His kitchen to cook food for Him. Once I made ice cream for 
Him, and He said, 'Mother, this is yum yum!' 

"I remember this sort of moment best. You know, He never had me 
sit on the floor like other workersâ€”He always arranged a chair for me. 
Though I was the disciple, He was such a gentleman with me. 

"Countless times I saw Him perform miracles with other workers and 
Margis. But I never desired that experience. I don't crave things which 
come and go. I only want what's permanent. So He never gave me those 
kinds of miracles. Yet I know He hears the words I am speaking right 
now. No one can hide anything from Baba. 

"You must listen to Guru like a child listens to his teacher in school. 
Though Baba is against dogma, we must have blind faith in Him. This 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


352 


alone is surrender. The more the child surrenders, the more He must 
take care." 

She turned to each of the Margis to ask them how they felt in Indiaâ€”it 
was the first visit for each of them. When it came to Taiwan sister 
Madhavi's turn, she said, "I'm fine, Aunty." Knowing that Madhavi was 
actually sick, I said, "You see, Aunty, Madhavi is Chinese. So even if she 
has problems, she will say she has no problems." 

Aunty said, "Why should she have problems? She is a yogini, a 
Tantric." 

"But the more we Tantrics evolve, Aunty," I said, "the more probÂ¬ 
lems we have." 

"No, no," she said. "No problems." 

"But look at Baba," I said. "He has so many problems." 

"Oh, Baba. He is something different. Listen, don't make problems 
where there need be no problems." 

She gazed at me, smiling. Her last sentence, simple and obvious as it 
was, rang in my mind. For the first time in my life I realized that I had a 
tendency to dig up problems and complications even when they were 
best left undisturbed. I will never forget her words . 100 

Global water crisis 

Ananda Nagar. June. During a workers' meeting, Baba said, "A water 
crisis is soon to strike the earth. Due to overuse of underground water 
resources, the water-table is sinking. Furthermore, at some point that 
water will become so polluted it can no longer be processed for drinking. 
This problem will dominate over most other problems in most countries 
of the world. It will be the direct cause of millions of deaths. In many 
areas people will become dependent on rainwater. International 
commerce in water will become more than commerce in petroleum. This 
crisis will come to a peak in the year 2000. Will you remember that? 
2000? (So saying, Baba used His forefinger to draw the numerals 2-0-0- 
o in the air.) It is for this reason that on our Master Units, next to every 
building, a pond should be constructed to catch the rainwater. Our 
Master Units should not depend on underground water sources." 


100 A few weeks later Aunty died.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


The most powerful mudra I ever felt 

Baba's DMC varabhaya mudra (gesture of blessing) was scheduled 
for today. In the moment that we all expected Him to give the mudra, 
however, He brought His hands down on the couchâ€”so forcefully that it 
made a dull noise. 

There are all sorts of speculative explanations. But no one really 
understands Baba's strange behavior. 

The crowd of about 30,000 was disappointed. 

Two days later. There was no darshan this morning; the program 
was clearly finished, and most people arranged to leave. We faced the 
usual problems of secretly removing the overseas Margis. The police 
want to catch foreign Margis and blacklist them from reentering India. 
In the past, we hid them inside large trucks. But this time the trucks 
were delayed, and hadn't come. 

Two or three workers made a plan to hustle the overseas Margis into 
a train during its stop in Pundag (the closest station). This plan was 
neither announced nor clarified, even when it came time to rush the first 
batch of Margis to the train. At that time, about two or three thousand 
Indian Margis were also boarding. 

The police spotted the non-Indians, and took up the chase. While 
most of the foreigners escaped, they succeeded in capturing three sisters 
and one brother. In the process, they ripped off some of the women's 
clothing in a most disrespectful manner. In India such behavior toward 
women is considered outrageous. Within moments the Margis were 
taken off to the nearby policebox. 

The Indian Margis were so angry about the behavior of the police 
that they pulled out one of the track railings, rendering the train imÂ¬ 
mobile. The Margis declared they would not permit the train to leave 
until the captured Margis were released. 

The few hundred innocent passengers already on the train became 
the victims of this drama. Two Margis gave them a mass lecture to 
explain the problem, and all became sympathetic. The Margis brought 
water and snacks for the stranded passengers. 

Meanwhile, back at Ananda Nagar (about two kilometers away), all 
the overseas workers had long before changed from their orange

354 


robes to civilian clothes. Hearing that the police and local communist 
thugs were preparing for a confrontation, we engaged ourselves in planÂ¬ 
ning and constructing a defense. We began shifting the women and 
children into more central buildings where they would be safer. In this 
way, several hours passed. The tension increased, and still the train 
remained. Because it was a fasting day, the strain was not only psychic 
but also physical. 

At 10:00 p.m., someone yelled, "I see Baba's car! It's headed toward 
the darshan tent!" Since the DMC program seemed finished, and as we 
were in the midst of a dangerous crisis, we could not believe that Baba 
would give darshan. But better run to the tent to see! 

By the time I entered, Baba was already seated, and a program was 
indeed underway. For the first time ever, I sat in the middle instead of 
the front for darshan. Being in civil clothes, I preferred not to attract the 
attention of anyone, including Baba. 

Because many people had already left, and the tent was half empty, 
the feeling was strange. But Baba was in a fine mood, joking and speakÂ¬ 
ing casually. When He finally started the formal darshan itself, the air 
became energized. By the time He had half finished, I was so concenÂ¬ 
trated on Him that I unconsciously shifted from my normal cross-legged 
position to a strained kneeling pose. Even though He spoke in Bengali, I 
became excited. I didn't know why. And then I thought, "Perhaps He'll 
give the mudra. How odd if it's so, but..." A few moments later He began 
singing the chant Samgacchadvam, which always precedes the mudra. 
We all sat forward, astounded, waiting, tense. 

And He gave it. A varabhaya mudra as I had never before experiÂ¬ 
enced. He used to hold the mudra for perhaps five seconds or less. But 
this one, how long did it last? At the time it seemed interminable. 
Everyone, absolutely everyone, including the small children, were 
blasted. Shouts of "Baba! Baba!" came from all sides. I also shouted 
uncontrollably. My hair seemed to stand on end. My eyes felt as if they 
would pop out of their sockets, and my skin as if it would explode off my 
body. My heart burst with feeling for Him, and my mind stopped 
functioning, except to think Baba! Baba! 

At last He closed His hands, and did namaskar. Perhaps forty secÂ¬ 
onds had passed. The crowd sang Prabhat Sang!it or something, I don't 
rememberâ€”I remained absorbed in looking at Him. Then everyone 



355 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


stood up to dance kiirtan. I stood but could not dance. I could only stare 
at Him. As the kiirtan continued, Baba slowly walked off the stage. 

Without thinking, I ran toward Him. The tent was so big. I did not 
know where He had gone, but I lifted up one wall, dove under, and kept 
running. Sooner than I expected, I saw Baba entering His car. Volunteer 
guards were protecting the area with their sticks. Paying no attention to 
them, I rushed toward Baba. The guards didn't react quickly enough, 
and I was soon past them. I rushed up to the window of Baba's car 
without any concern for the impropriety of my clothing. I was crying. 

The car drove away before I could touch it. I ran alongside it. I could 
clearly see Baba, though He did not see me. Weeping and running. Oh, 
Baba! It went on a long way like that. Then the car sped up, leaving me 
behind. 

I walked slowly toward our quarters. Someone came from behind me 
and took my handâ€”Dada Nityashubhananda. He was also deeply 
affected. We walked together without speaking, tears welling in our eyes. 
When we arrived at the hostel, I excused myself and went up to the roof 
to be alone in the darkness. Everyone else was still at the darshan tent. 
As I sat for meditation, I heard powerful, booming voices speaking to 
the crowd over the PA system. 

The mudra had invested everyone with such energy that an immeÂ¬ 
diate return to normality was impossible. Remembering the stand-off at 
the train station, the Margis became even more excited. They could no 
longer tolerate the injustice. Hundreds poured out of the tent and raced 
toward the station. 

Silence returned. I slipped deep into meditation and paid no heed to my 
surroundings. I was unaware when the overseas Margis returned to the 
hostel. Unaware when, some time later, a great hubbub stirred. 

Someone ran onto the roof. "Dada, we've been looking for you! Come 
quickly, there's an emergency!" 

Uninterested, but compelled by duty (I have been the main organizer 
for overseas Margis during this DMC), I rose slowly to my feet and made 
my way downstairs. Three or four workers rushed up to me. 
"Dharmavedananda, where've you been? There's been an attack!" 

My senses returned. "Where? What happened exactly?" 

"The police went mad at the station area! They fired their rifles ranÂ¬ 
domly in all directions! Many people were hit, and some may be dead!" 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


356 


I looked at my watch. After midnight. Margis and workers were 
running here and there. A Dada told me that he was going to the hosÂ¬ 
pital by motorcycle to check on the extent of the injuries and asked me if 
I wanted to come. I nodded. Within minutes we were there. 

About twenty men were lying in beds, groaning from bullet shots. 
One in particular was screaming in pain. Not long after, he died. The 
condition of four others was critical. 

The police had fired indiscriminately. Though many women and 
children were in the crowd, none were hit. It seemed that only divine 
dispensation had spared them. 

The suffering was very real. For some reason I was inspired. Their 
stolid manner in the face of agony, the history in the making of which all 
were aware, and the fact that Baba chose this moment to give His 
mudraâ€”l felt, I had to feel, that a noble purpose was behind us. I held 
someone's hand here, touched a forehead thereâ€”what more could I do? 
The doctors and nurses were caring for them, and I had still to think for 
the overseas Margis. 

We went back to constructing more defenses, still discussing how to 
escape, taking care of some Margis who were inexperienced, helping 
others to adjust who were physically illâ€”it was late, 3:30 a.m.; we had 
been fasting in the heat all day; Margis were collapsing, closing their 
eyes, sleeping. It was enough already. I informed the guards that I, too, 
would rest until the sun rose, and to wake me if there was news. 

Dramatic education 

At sunrise, I awoke. A few workers were talking. 

"Has anyone spoken to Baba about all this?" I asked. 

"Just now one Dada came with that news. Baba said, 'I'm very 
pained by the suffering of these boys. But why did no one check with me 
before rushing in front of the police? It was inappropriate.'" 

Soon after, the trucks finally arrived. We prepared to leave in our 
normal secret manner. 

And what about the four imprisoned overseas Margis? After hearing 
Baba's comment, we decided to deal with their cases through the courts. 



357 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Ranchi. The evening papers ran headlines stories about the attack. 
Photos of the dead Dada and the four severely injured workers appeared 
with long articles condemning the behavior of the police. 

Though this conflict may have technically been inappropriate, I feel 
it was a part of the Cosmic plan. The Margis now understand better the 
injustice of this government and the general public has gained further 
evidence of the persecution of Ananda Marga. We have experienced and 
learned many things through this incident. 

Maybe I have no right to make the following comment. Nevertheless: 
Though Baba's words condemned the Margis' action, I feel He knew it 
would happen, and perhaps on the psychic level caused it to happen. It 
was obvious that Baba should have been consulted first; I think He 
speeded up their minds and made them forget to ask Him. In order to 
create various circumstances for our growth, the Tantra guru often 
causes us to commit mistakes, without which the necessary conditions 
would never develop. 

Some people may consider my opinion a heartless one. For me, 
however, this idea is full of love. I remember Baba's explanation as to 
why Krishna engineered the Mahabharata war: "It was meant for popuÂ¬ 
lar education. If Parama Purusha (Cosmic Consciousness) accomÂ¬ 
plishes everything by mere thought-projection, the lessons would go 
unnoticed and unlearnt by others....Hence, events like the battle of 
Kurukshetra had to be conceived and dramatized....Nobody was 
sparedâ€” even Abhimanyu, the nephew of Krishna and son of Aijuna, 
was not spared. For in war between virtue and vice, the sparks of the fire 
spread out on all sides." 101 

Conversation on a train 

New Delhi. While coming here by train, I overheard an interesting 
conversation. Several educated men were discussing world politics. They 
spoke in English. When their conversation turned to the predicament of 
communism, one of them said, "The strange fact is that many years ago 
the guru of Ananda Marga, P.R. Sarkar, predicted in detail the collapse 
of communism." 

Another man made a few comments about Baba, and finished by 
saying, "Yes, in every age at least one such great intellectual is there."

"But he also prophesied the demise of capitalism," said a third. "I 
don't know about that." 

"Well, none of us knew about communism's downfall either. Let's wait 
and see. If I had to wager, I'd bet whatever Sarkar said is correct." 

They all nodded their heads. I was about to stick my neck out and say 
something, when they changed the topic. 

The university 

Tokyo. A Dada returned from India today. The latest news is that 
Baba has started a new program. A university is being created in Ananda 
Nagar. 

Several times daily, jeeps and motorcycles arrive at the Central OfÂ¬ 
fice piled high with books to be used for the university library. The books 
are perused by a full-time staff of workers and Margis. One of the largest 
rooms in the office is being used for planning the university's 
architecture, courses, staff needs, budgets and so on. They are hoping to 
open the university before the end of the year, and so, an enormous 
amount of preparation is required. 102 

Amnesty cooperates 

A few days ago, while teaching meditation at Waseda University, I 
met a few student members of Amnesty International. On their initiaÂ¬ 
tive, I was introduced to a local Amnesty leader who spoke fluent EnÂ¬ 
glish. I explained that Ananda Nagar workers are facing almost daily 
attacks from thugs and police. I also explained that Amnesty never 
helped us when Baba was in jail, because His case was then classified as 
a criminal case. She was sympathetic and requested me to show her 
proof of my allegations. Since then, we have had several meetings, and I 
have presented all the newspaper clippings, court decisions and other 
documents related to the persecution of Ananda Marga in Bengal. Today 
the Tokyo Amnesty office formally took up our case and began 
correspondence with their London headquarters. The woman in-charge 
told me they would insist on a proper investigation, though it may take a 
few weeks to get the ball rolling. 


102 T ogether with theM aster Unit program, the university is one of our most important 
Central projects. It isconcerned not only with academic study but also with practical research 
on new scientific inventions and agricultural systemsat Ananda Nagar.

TotaI shock 

October 22. The most shocking experience of my life occurred today. 

At 3:00 in the morning, Dada Artapremananda woke me up and 
called me into his office where he had been sleeping alone. His eyes 
bulged, his body shivered continuously, and his skin was pale. He looked 
as if he had gone mad. 

"I... received ... a phone call two hours ago," he stammered. "I 
couldn't believe it, and just sat here dazed since then. But... but... now 
another call came. So I had to tell someone." 

"What is it?" I said. 

He started weeping and shaking furiously. I put my hand on his 
shoulder to try to comfort him. "Baba ... is ... gone." 

"What! What are you talking about?" I said. 

His crying and shaking increased. 

"Did you have a bad dream or something?" 

"No. No. Oh, Baba. First Didi Hemavati called me from Korea. Now 
someone called from Calcutta. It's true. Baba's left His body." 

"It's impossible! I can't believe it, and I don't accept it." 

"Oh, I don't know what to do or what to think," he said. 

"No, this is ridiculous. Baba couldn't have died. He said He would 
stay until His work was done. It must be something else. I am going to 
call Calcutta." 

"Alright." 

After a few minutes I was able to get through. Dada Bhaveshananda 
answered. 

"What happened?" I said. 

His voice was sober, slow and somewhat shaking, "It seems... Baba 
left." 

"What do you mean seems?" 

"The life force is gone for some hours now. No pulse. Nothing." 
"Perhaps He's in samadhi or some special state. Maybe He will come out 
of it after some time." 

"Well, we hope so. But... I don't think so." 

I tried to think of something else to say, but my mind went blank. I 
passed the phone to Artapremanandaji, and he spoke briefly in Hindi. 
Then he hung up. He turned to me, saying, "What should we do?" 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


360 


"Well, I simply don't believe Baba's died," I said, almost calmly. "But 
in any case, something extraordinary's happened, so I want to go to 
India immediately." 

"Yes, I'll also go." 

"Now we should tell the other Dadas." 

"Oh, I can't talk anymore." "It's okay. I'll 

tell them." 

I woke up the others and brought them in the room. I felt very cold, 
but otherwise almost normal. After speaking a few words of introducÂ¬ 
tion to prepare their minds, I said, "They're all telling that Baba has 
died." 

No one said a word. But all four of them stared at me eerily. Their 
faces all wore strange expressions, and they edged closer toward me. 
"There's no explanation," I said. "And personally, I just don't believe it." 

They could hardly speak. I don't know why, but I think they immeÂ¬ 
diately accepted it as true. Without saying a word, Moksanandaji got up, 
took his jacket, and walked out of the house. The others wandered 
aimlessly or sat and stared at the walls. 

I was sure there was more to the story. Unworried, I took a shower, 
entered the meditation room, and sang kiirtan as if it were an ordinary 
day. No one joined me. 

At 9:001 phoned our travel agent and booked tickets for Artapre- 
manandaji and myself. By 10:00 we were out the door and on our way to 
the airport. 

Sitting in the plane, I was still feeling relatively normal when 
Artapremanandaji turned to me and said, "I just remembered someÂ¬ 
thing Bhaveshananda told me which I didn't tell you. They've already 
put Baba's body on the ice." 

His words hit me like a sledgehammer. "What? But then ... He must 
really be ... Oh, God, no! Oh, no! Then He's really dead!" 

I turned my face away. At this point I can't clearly remember what 
happened, except that I went mad. A million ideas and visions passed 
through me. I thought of every possibility of what it meant for Baba and 
for me. I wept at my loss, wept at the world's loss, worried for Baba, 
blamed Him, felt as lonely as a boat lost at sea, burned in my physical 
heart, felt guilty, felt rejected, felt insane. I even thought of leaving 



361 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Ananda Marga. Why should I stay without Baba? Our mission was not 
yet finished, and we would never be able to complete it without Him. 

After about an hour, I regained my composure. It was just a test. He 
knew what He was doing, as He had always known. There must be a 
great purpose behind it. Though I never imagined He would do such a 
thing, I had to accept it. Though it was intolerable, I had to tolerate it. I 
would have to go ahead, and I steeled my mind for the task. I forced it to 
be positive, if not happy. 

Throughout this time I hadn't spoken to Artapremanandaji. At this 
point I turned toward him, saying, "I'm okay now." He nodded his head. 

When we reached Bangkok, we called Japan. Only a few minutes 
before, Moksanandaji had returned. After receiving the news, he had 
strayed through the streets of Tokyo for fifteen hours. 

H e remains active without H is physical body 

Yesterday I received an emergency visa from the Indian embassy in 
Thailand. After discussing the matter with a few workers, it was decided 
that all Didis and Dadas could come. We phoned Japan, Taiwan, Korea 
and Hong Kong. 

Today at 2:00 a.m., while standing in the line for the immigration 
check in Delhi, I befriended a Japanese tourist and translated all the 
procedures for him. 

Just after receiving my entry stamp, an elderly official in civil clothes 
directed me to the side of the room. 

"You've come for the funeral, haven't you?" he said. 

"What funeral?" 

"You know very well. The Anand Marg funeral." "I'm sorry, I don't know 
what you're talking about." "Listen. I'm an old man. I've seen you in 
Calcutta. I know you're a Margi." 

"Sir, I've never been to Calcutta." 

"I don't want to disturb your program. If you admit the truth to me, I 
will allow you to go ahead for the funeral. Why should I trouble you at a 
moment like this? But if you persist in this drama, I will have you 
deported. Now, please confirm that you are an Anand Margi." 

"A what? Look, it's very late. I'm tired, and I don't know what you're 
talking about." 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call

He turned toward another official and directed the Japanese man to 
be pulled out of the line, suspecting him also to be a Margi. I would have 
laughed internally, but I wasn't in great humor. For God's sake, I was 
enough troubled, and now on top of it, I was going to get deported. 
Surely they would find out the truth because my suitcase contained my 
orange uniform, and Ananda Marga books and documents. I had never 
before been stopped like this, except in Calcutta, so I hadn't taken any 
precautions. 

He asked questions for another half hour. I desperately clung to my 
story that I didn't know Ananda Marga, and was following nobody and 
nothing except my own nose. He didn't believe a single word. MeanÂ¬ 
while, the Japanese fellow was questioned by someone else. 

At last the old man turned to an assistant, saying, "Go check his 
luggage for any Anand Marg related items." 

As I hopelessly handed over the luggage key, I thought, Baba, if You 
get me out of this one, then I'll accept You're still active, even without 
Your physical body. 

About ten minutes later, the assistant returned. He shook his head. 

"I can't believe it," said the officer in Hindi. "Are you sure there's 
nothing?" 

"Nothing," said the assistant, shrugging his shoulders. 

The officer scowled. He stared into my eyes. I looked back 
nonchalantly, hardly believing my luck. "I'm sure you're a Margi," he 
said. "But... you're free to go now." 

"Thanks a lot," I grunted. Then I thought, Baba, You're still with me! 
How did You manage it? 

1 picked up my luggage, and walked to the green channel. 

"Do you have anything to declare?" asked a custom's official. 

"Only a small cheap camera," I said. 

"Show it to me," he said. 

Opening my suitcase, I shuffled my orange clothes and other posÂ¬ 
sessions around. The camera wasn't there, and neither was a box of 
empty cassette tapes. So that was it! The assistant knew I'd never expose 
his theft. 

"Sorry," I said. "Forgot I left it in Thailand." 

As the official waved me through, I looked back and saw the poor 
Japanese man sweating under the old man's investigation.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Losing my center 

Calcutta. Thousands of Margis are here, eyes glazed or filled with 

tears. 

Because I had already adjusted myself during the plane flight with 
Artapremanandaji, I felt calm. I stood in a long line waiting to enter 
Baba's house to see His body. Next to me stood Cintamani, a Margi from 
Norway. He was particularly lucky, even inspired. After not going to 
India for about ten years, something had pushed him to come here one 
month ago. He was blessed to experience Baba in the last weeks of His 
life. 

We were calmly talking together when suddenly, unexpectandy, a 
surge of feeling rose from my chest, and before I knew what I was doing, 
I was sobbing. As my knees gave way, Cintamani held me up. 

"It's okay, Dadaji, it's okay," he said. 

Now I'd lost my center. Nothing could console me. I dragged myself 
toward the house, crying continuously. 

When I entered the door, I saw Him. His face was peaceful, beautiful. 
Immediately I felt alright. He knew what He was doing. I accepted it 
fully. 

After leaving the room, I went to the back of the line. I waited, and 
again entered; again stared at Him. Again and again I made the circuit. 

It was my last chance to see Him, so why should I do anything else? 

A few hours later, a Dada approached me and asked me if I wanted 
to run the video camera inside Baba's house. 

I accepted, knowing that while it wouldn't be enjoyable, it was a way 
to keep busy, and remain inside Baba's room at the same time. 

I filmed thousands of Margis as they shuffled around the body. Each 
face was unique, but each was filled with anguish. Occasionally, someÂ¬ 
one collapsed, screaming in agony. Some workers and Margis who I 
highly respected, lost all control, and acted with unconscious abandon. 
As for me, at first I believed I had regained my composure. But again 
and again, I lost it, and wept bitterly. 

I filmed many brothers and sisters that I hadn't seen in years. It was 
not the time, however, to say hello. 

Why and how He left 

The Central workers called a meeting of overseas Margis and workÂ¬ 
ers. Who was there who did not wonder why and how Baba had sudÂ¬ 
denly left us?
