## He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


Baba's personal assistant, Dada Keshavananda, told us about the 
days leading up to October 21st: 

"Since August, He was clearly in a hurry. He spent very little time alone, 
instead calling frequent group and individual meetings. Over the last 
weeks, many times in the wee hours of the morning, say 3:00 or 4:00, 
He woke me, and instructed me to call certain workers. The first time it 
happened I told Him that it was 3:00, and that they would surely be 
sleeping. He became angry, and said, If those workers are not here 
within ten minutes, I shall never give them the program that's in my 
mind.' Of course I got them. We all became exhausted with His speed, 
but instead of slowing down, He accelerated. Sometimes we talked 
between ourselves, wondering at the cause of His haste. No one, 
however, came close to imagining that He was busy putting the final 
touches on His life's work. 

"Only one week before His departure, Baba gave kapalika initiation 
to the largest number of workers ever. He requested one hundred 
candidates. Because He had always been very selective in approving 
workers for this purpose, we were not prepared, and could only round 
up seventy-nine. He always rejected more applicants than He approved. 
But this time, without even asking any questions, He approved all. We 
were bewildered at His behavior. 

"Immediately after the initiations, Baba became sick. Well, at least that 
was normal. After taking on many persons' samskaras, He usually 
became sick. And this was by far the biggest number. 

"On the last day, October 21st, His health actually improved. It was 
better than it had been in a long time. The morning was normal. He was 
working with the same tremendous speed that he had shown during 
these last months. Though late on the previous night He had composed 
the final two Prabhat Sangiits (numbers 5017 and 5018), He rose at 
3:00 a.m. as usual to perform His spiritual practices. Later, He reviewed 
the work of various departments and gave instructions while shaving- 
even this was usual for His hectic schedule. He always told us, 'You 
should not only be prepared to die while working, you should even work 
while dying.' These words He clearly practiced. 

"Shortly before 2:00 p.m., He said to me, T want to think.' As I shut 
the door, I thought, He's never said such a thing before. After a few minutes He called me. I believe it was during those minutes that He 
carefully reviewed all His planning, and confirmed that nothing 
remained to be done. He called one of the new avadhutas, and spent one 
hour alone with that Dada. That was the last work of Baba's life-personal 
attention given to a young worker. After that, He said to me, T want to 
rest now.' These words also He had never before spoken. About five 
minutes later, He rang the callbell, and when I came, He pointed at His 
chest, and said, 'Heart.' 

"I immediately ran for the doctors. They came quickly, and began 
massage. But as they felt for Baba's pulse, their faces became ashen. 
When they said, 'The life-force is gone,' we could not believe it." 

Dada Mantreshvarananda, the Central Public Relations Secretary 
said: 

"Why did He leave so suddenly? I remember several years ago, Baba 
said, 'When my work is done, I will leave immediately. I won't remain 
even a single extra moment.' He wrote hundreds of books, provided 
sufficient guidance in every realm of work and life, fully established the 
global structure, and, most importantly, trained the workers. What more 
was there to do? The rest depends on us. 

"Yes, it depends on us. About ten days before, I think it was 12th 
October, during the reporting session, Baba asked us three times, 'Can 1 
depend on you to carry on my mission?' We repeatedly replied, 'Yes, You 
can depend on us.' 

"Many workers wondered what it meant, because the wording im¬ 
plied Baba was leaving us, though no one dared utter such a thought. 
Then He made us take the following oath: 

'All my energy, all my mind, all my thoughts, all my deeds are to be 
goaded unto the path of the collective elevation of human society 
without neglecting other animate and inanimate objects right from this 
moment until the last point of my living on this earth.' 

"The power was such that everyone became super-charged, and felt 
ready to do any work. 

"A few days later, Baba asked me, 'Mantreshvarananda, which Prabhat 
Sangiita do people generally like?' I mentioned a few songs, then I added more, and still I couldn't decide, and added even more. 
Baba said, 'If I give you time, maybe you'll list all the songs. But do 
people like, Tumi esechilekaokenabolenabolia cholegde?" (Meaning: 
You came without telling anyone, and You went back without telling 
anyone.) I said, 'Yes, Baba, that is a very sweet song.' I'll remember 
forever how He smiled at that time. 

"About the same time, while dictating a book to three of us— 
Vijayanandaji, the General Secretary and me—He said, 'Do you know 
that all the doctors are experimenting on me? But they cannot cure me. 
And no one can Cure me. It depends on my samkalpa— my vow of 
determination. If I think disease, disease comes. If I think cure, cure 
comes. And it completely depends on me what I should think.' 

"The Calcutta Circle workers meeting finished on schedule on the 
17th. But Baba did not give those workers permission to leave. This 
violated His long-standing system. The Delhi Sector meeting started, 
and also some global workers arrived. Only on the 21st, did we realize 
He had thus arranged for maximum workers to be here for His Great 
Departure. 

"On the 20th, the night before His departure, He held a meeting for 
Prout workers—both Margis and Dadas. He questioned each Margi, one 
by one, taking their reports. Then He had us repeat the oath, the same 
one which we had pledged in the October 12th meeting. As far as my 
knowledge goes, this was the first and last time He had not only Dadas 
but also Margis collectively making a promise. He then explained the 
situation of the whole world, describing how demonic people are making 
efforts to destroy the social and ecological orders, while good people are 
rapidly uniting together, preparing to fight those demons. 

"Then He said, 'Serpents are exhaling venom everywhere. It is the 
right moment, it is the proper moment, it is the most opportune mo¬ 
ment. Now at this critical juncture, should we go on preaching the gos¬ 
pel of peace? No, no, no! So before my departure from this world, I have 
made the necessary preparation for the fight against these demons.' 

"He added in verse-form: Serpents are exhaling venom everywhere. 
The sweet gospels of peace sound like empty mockery. That is why on 
theeveof my departure from this world, I send out a clarion call to all 
those in every house who are preparing to fight against the demons in 
human form. 


"We were all shocked. What is this? Baba is departing from this 
world? Then He added, 'So said the great poet Rabindranath Tagore.' 

We all breathed a sigh of relief, believing He had simply been quoting a 
poem. No one guessed that in truth this was His own message, and last 
message .34 

"After the reporting, Baba talked to me alone in His room. He asked 
if everyone was inspired, which I confirmed. Then He asked me what 
they all thought about the poem. I said, 'Baba, it is appropriate, and 
really it is happening in each Margi's life.' He nodded His head. 

One last thing I want to add. Two or three weeks ago, Baba said, 
'Many people may say, "Baba, I love you." In truth, they may or may not 
love. But he who loves my ideology really loves me. Because I have 
merged myself with my ideology.'" 

Himanshuji, Baba's youngest brother, came to Calcutta a few days 
ago, together with several other family members. He said: 

"I was in His room on the last night, the 20th, with some of our 
family. While taking His meal, He spoke to us all, 'Whenever the senior 
person of the family or the guru dies, the others must be very careful for 
one year, because many misfortunes may come.' 

"I didn't accept what He said at face-value, and said, 'Why need it 
happen like that, Baba? It will all be due only to psychological reasons, 
which can be overcome.' 

"'No,' He said. 'There is no scientific explanation. You have simply 
got to accept it. Have you heard the phrase Maha Guru N i Pat? It means 
the departure of the Great Guru. It means the nearest and most dear one 
leaves this world. Do you know what you should do in that case?' 

"As we didn't know, He continued, 'For one year, one should not 
make any luxurious function, construct any special lighting or decoration, or arrange any party. Sorrow should be observed for one year. You 
must be very careful for one year.'

Baba's exact Bengali while quoting Tagore's poem was: Na'giniira' ca'ridike pheliteche 
vis'a'kta vishva'sSha'ntir lalita va'n'ii shona'ibe vyartha pariha'sa. Vida'y neba'r a'ge ta'i d'a'k 
diyeja'i Da'naver sa'the sam'gra'mer tarePrastiita hatecheya'ra' ghareghare. 


 

"I believed He was only speaking philosophy or theory. I never imag¬ 
ined we would have to apply His words from the very next day. 

"Another point is that I used to inform Baba of the day I would 
return to my home and take permission from Him to leave. But this 
time, for the first time, He asked me when I was leaving. I was thinking 
of leaving after two days, that is Monday, but I thought He was asking 
because He wanted me to stay much longer. Since I didn't want to annoy 
Him, I couldn't find any words to reply. Then in a loud voice, He said, 
'I'm simply asking if you'll be here tomorrow, Sunday, or not.' I said, 

'Yes, Baba, I'm leaving on Monday.' He said, 'I'm not asking about 
Monday, only Sunday.' 

"At last He sang a folk song of Bihar to us. I laughed at this, thinking 
He was joking. He noticed my laugh, and said, 'It's not ordinary music. 
It's a classical song.' The song's meaning was 'If I will not be here any 
longer, my cart will still continue to move by the power of God.'" 

Dada Vimalananda told us about an incident that explains, perhaps 
better than any, why He had to leave us: 

"A few years ago, during a meeting of Proutists, one Margi asked, 
'Baba, when will Prout be established?' 

"Baba replied, 'When you are perched in a fruit tree, you can only eat 
the fruits on the treet not the ones on the ground. When you stand on 
the ground, you can only eat the fruits which lie on the ground, not the 
ones hanging on the tree. Those who will get This (He pointed to 
Himself), will not get That (meaning Prout society). Which one do you 
want, This or That?' 

"The Margis protested, saying, 'Oh, Baba, We want both. We want 
both Prout and You.' 

"Baba said, 'No, no. You can have only one or the other.' 

"He didn't solve all the problems before He left. He left the guidelines, showed some demonstrations, and provided the force to achieve 
the solutions. We have to solve the problems. We have to establish 
Prout." 



After this story, Vimalanandaji told us another one which explained 
something about the purpose of Baba's life: 

In the early 1960's, when Margis could chat intimately with Baba, 
one Margi — perhaps Dasarath Dada, a family achaya — said, "Baba, 

You meditate every day even though You have no need to meditate. 

What is the object of Your meditation? And, Baba, if You don't mind, 
can You tell us what is Your mantra?" 

Baba became quiet and then said, "I meditate on all of my children 
throughout the world." 

"And Your mantra, Baba?" 

His mood shifted, and some profound emotion swept through His 
facial muscles as He said, "My mantra is Manus'oham (I am a human 
being). If I miss ideating on this mantra for even a single breath, My 
worldly existence becomes jeopardized." 

With these words, Baba took a deep breath, and His body shivered. 
The Margis grabbed His feet, rubbed them and, fearing He might in that 
very moment depart, they cried. 

The orange fire 

Since I've been here, the sky has been overcast. It drizzles continu¬ 
ously-adding to the gloomy feeling. I am told that the weather was fine 
until the moment Baba left on the 21st. This morning, the weather was 
still dismal. 

About ten thousand Margis were gathered on the front lawn in front 
of the Central Office. All of us either sat or stood around the great 
cement funeral pyre which has been constructed in the shape of a six- 
pointed star (as in our symbol). It will remain as a permanent reminder 
of this day. The crowd was abnormally restrained in their behavior. They 
sang non-stop PrabhatSangiit and kiirtan. 

At noon, the pall bearers appeared, carrying an open coffin in which 
Baba lay. Almost in one voice, thousands of persons let out a gasp, then 
a sigh. Though many wept quietly, the overall atmosphere was calm. 
According to Ananda Marga system, a short ceremony to console the 
bereaved was performed in which all participated. A final Guru Puja was 
sung, sung with a feeling never before known. 

Purified butter was poured on His body, the fire lit, and thick, dark 
smoke rose. Exactly at that moment, two things happened. After six 


days of continuous clouds, the sky suddenly cleared sufficiently for the 
sun to shine down brightly, the rays illuminating only the cremation 
area. At the same time, a flock of birds dropped down from the clouds in 
a V-formation, executed a tight circle directly over His body, and flew off 
in steep ascent. 

## He Sends Out a Clarion Call 

For three hours the orange fire burned. The crowd continued to sit 
and sing. During all that time, the sun shined brightly. At last, the fire 
was gone, and only the slight remains went on smoking. The sun again 
disappeared, the sky grew cloudy and somber, and gradually the Margis 
dispersed. 

Later in the evening, I was sitting alone on the roof, thinking of 
nothing in particular. I felt freer than ever and full of love for Baba. For 
a moment, my mind looked at itself and wondered why it was feeling so 
peaceful. Immediately I knew: a previously unrecognized impediment in 
my relation with Baba had been burned. 

I found that I had always harbored a fear, deep in my subconscious 
mind, that something in my guru was not perfect, that some sort of 
personal ambition or purpose may have affected Him. Though I had not 
been aware of this fear, it had nevertheless subtly affected me. Now it 
was abundantly clear that He was a man who had not been guided by 
even the minutest ego. His death was the final proof. Though He had 
obviously planned His final moment in detail, He made no drama of it. 

The manner of His departure was in perfect silent harmony with the 
message of His life. 


If my story were divided dramatically, my first years on the spiritual 
path and in Ananda Marga would be Act I, and the period I physically 
knew Baba would be Act II. His physical departure leads me into Act III. 
Act III is the most critical one, for it is in His absence that we will see the 
test of His teachings, His love and the Tantric power that He exudes 
without the burden of a physical body. 

A few years ago, He mentioned in a workers' meeting: "After my 
physical passing, Margis and workers will be blessed with greater psy¬ 
chic and spiritual attention than I am presently able to provide. They 
will be very fortunate." At that time we gave little importance to His 
words, thinking He would remain with us for a long time. 

Though it is still too early to know how Act III will unfold, we can 
take a look at some of the earliest scenes. 

Continuation of H is system 

Calcutta. 28 October. Several newspapers reported: "In the after- 
math of P.R. Sarkar's passing, a great power struggle flares among 
Ananda Marga's Central workers, as they fight over establishing new 
systems and new leadership." As usual, the newspapers write with an 
authority they don't deserve. Here everyone is aware of Baba's warning 
to His brother and other family members that "After M aha Guru Ni Pat, 
the departure of the great guru, for one year you must be very careful." 
No one contemplates making major changes during this period. As the 
Central Committee already exists, it is only necessary to chose a new 
president. 

Today, without fanfare, Dada Shraddhananda was unanimously 
elected for the post. From all corners of our organization, he is regarded 
as a saintly man, simple, straightforward, and uninvolved in 



political psychology or favoritism. Over seventy years old, he spent the 
last years working in a small room as Central Finance Secretary and 
editor of the Central newsletter. 

Though it has no relation to the above, now, while writing, I 
suddenly remember my dream of January 1987 104 . Baba gave me a 
glimpse of a symbolic future when I should be careful not to forget Him 
due to the presence of other personalities, no matter how outstanding 
they might be. 

" W hatever happens I planned long ago" 

New Delhi. November. I don't know how many Margis and workers 
told me stories of their dreams or thoughts which clearly foreshadowed 
Baba's departure. I heard so many that it seems like nearly everyone had 
some form of premonition. 

I recall my own experience last June in Ananda Nagar: for the first 
and last time in my life I was wild to see Baba at the close of His con¬ 
cluding discourse. Then I became inconsolably depressed after my last 
look at Him when His car sped away from my sprinting feet. Though I 
was consciously unaware that it was my final moment with Baba, my 
heart obviously felt it. 

Dada Vicitrananda told me about an old Filipina woman. In the 
evening of the 21 st October, she telephoned him at our Manila office. 

"Is there any news about Baba?" she asked. 

"I'm sure He's fine, mother," Dada replied. 

"But I know there's some problem. Can you please call Calcutta? I 
cannot telephone from my little village." 

"Alright, don't worry, mother." 

She called an hour later, saying, "Did you get through, Dadaji?" 

"I couldn't get the line yet, mother." "Please. Please keep trying." 

He had not tried. Now he knew she would go on troubling him until 
he confirmed Baba's health. So he called Calcutta. He was shocked to 
hear that Baba was lying in trance. 


1M That was the dream when I was on a mountain together with unknown M argi mountain¬ 
peoplelistening to the two leaders of Ananda M arga. I forgot about Baba, who had become an 
old man. 



Vacitranandaji then called the old lady, and said, "Mother, you were 
right. Baba is not well. He is in some sort of trance." "No. No. It's worse 
than that," she said. 

One hour later, Dada called Calcutta again, and heard that Baba was 
no more. After going through his own agony, he called the old lady. 

"Mother ... you ... were right. Baba is ... gone." 

There was a moment of silence, then she hung up the phone without 
a word. 

Today I was on a train with Dada Bodhprajinananda who told me 
the following story: 

"On lith August in Minali, India, I had a dream. I was in Tiljala 
(Calcutta). I saw Baba's body on the main stage. It was covered with a 
sheet, lying on a cot. A huge number of Margis and workers sat in front 
of Him, and everyone was weeping. 

"I went near His body, though I also was crying. I lifted the cloth 
from His face, and said to Him, 'Baba, You left us without proper guid¬ 
ance and direction. How will we remain in this world? How will we 
establish our organizational system, Prout, and a moralist society?' 

"Then Baba woke up, sat up smiling, and said, 'Whatever I had to 
give, I have given. You do more and more kiirtan and meditation. Do as 
much noble work for the cause of society as you can. I am always with 
you. Go ahead.' 

"Then again He laid down, and the dream finished. 

"I told the Margi in whose house I was staying (he is a bank man¬ 
ager). Also Dada Harimayananda was with me, and I told him too. They 
encouraged me to call Calcutta to see if Baba was alright. I called, and 
found out Baba had just entered hospital, and was very sick. 

"After two months, when He really died, the thought of this dream 
helped me very much to overcome my sorrow." 

There are many such stories. But let's leave it at that for today. 

Dada Aksayananda tells another story. It is a long story, but this one 
will have to win the final prize for experiences showing how Baba pre¬ 
planned everything. 

Dada said: 



In 1979, Ananda Marga purchased a house in Lake Gardens, Calcutta 
for our Marga Guru Quarters. I was then Baba's second personal 
assistant. I frequently had the chance to talk with Him while performing 
massage. It was shortly after moving into the new house. I was alone 
with Him when I said, "Baba, at last there is a house in Calcutta which 
belongs to us. How would it be if we were to plant the grounds around 
the building and make a garden on the roof?" 

"You can do it," He replied, "but do you know what the result will be? If 
you plant around the house, the roots of the plants will damage the 
building's foundation. If you make a roof garden, the roof will be spoiled 
by water draining out of the flower pots." 

We didn't talk for a few minutes. When I looked at His face He 
seemed to be sleeping. Then a thought occurred to me. I started thinking 
we should get a much larger piece of land than this with a bigger house. 
Then I could make a big garden away from the building. There Baba 
could walk and enjoy the plants and the fresh air. 

"Aksayananda, are you saying anything?" Baba suddenly asked. 

"Nothing, Baba." 

"No, no. You were telling me something." 

I understood that Baba had been listening to my thoughts, so I re¬ 
plied, "Yes, Baba," and expressed my thoughts to Him. Baba only smiled 
and kept silent. He became reserved and silent for a few minutes. Then 
Baba closed His eyes for more than ten minutes. I wondered whether 
Baba was angry at me because at first I had told Him that I liked the new 
house, and then had started talking about getting another. 

Quite suddenly, Baba asked me to come near. I went close to His 
head, but Baba still did not open His eyes. I said, "Yes, Baba." 

He opened His eyes with a loving smile, and placed both His palms 
on my cheeks. 

"Yes, my son, what you thought may come true some day." He asked 
me to sit in meditation pose, close my eyes, and keep my mind con¬ 
centrated in my sixth chakra. He then asked me what I saw. 

I told Baba that I saw a grand house surrounded by beautiful trees 
and many plants. He told me to go further and see more. Then I heard 
the sounds of hundreds of birds and saw that they were flying from tree 
to tree. Again Baba asked me to see more. I told Him that I saw Him 
walking under the trees on a narrow path. Some Dadas were with Him. 
Baba asked me to go towards the house. 



"What are you seeing now?" 

"Baba, I see that the building has two parts, one on the east and one on 
the west. Also there are a few underground rooms." "Go inside the 
western room. What do you see there?" "Baba, there are rooms but no 
one is there." "Go downstairs to the underground room." "Baba, there's 
not enough light to see clearly." "Go outside and look around." 

"Baba, I see the rooms in the eastern part of the building." 

"Go inside. Now tell me what you see." 

"Baba, there are many Dadas and Didis there." 

"Go further inside. Tell me what you see." 

"There is a door, but it's closed." 

"Open it. What do you see?" 

"I see You there, Baba, lying on a bed." 

"All right. Come out of the room and go upstairs. What do you see?" 
"Baba, there is a big function going on with many people, and the 
room is beautifully decorated. Baba, You are sitting there with some 
other people." 

"Can you recognize them?" 

"No, Baba. I have never seen them before." 

"Is anybody else there?" 

"Yes. Two Dadas are doing something. They seem very busy." 

"And what else do you see?" 

"Baba, I see a marriage going on." 

"Can you recognize the bride and groom?" 

"No, Baba." 

"Now come downstairs. What do you see?" 

"A fountain." 

"And now what do you see?" 

"Baba, I see you going up in an elevator," I answered with 
surprise. "Go inside again. What do you see now?" "Baba, all the 
Dadas and Didis are weeping." "Ask them why they are weeping." 
"Baba, I am asking them, but no one is replying. They just raise their 
heads and look at me. No one will answer." "Ask them again." 


"Baba, they are simply weeping, and not replying." 

"All right. Come out now. Do you recognize the location of the 

house?" 

"It is somewhere in Calcutta, Baba, but not in Lake Gardens." 

Then the demonstration was over. He said, "Don't tell anyone about 
this just now. Keep it to yourself for now." 

Not long after, I was transferred to Kerala State. In January 1983 ,1 
made my first visit to Baba's new residence in Tiljala, Calcutta. There 
was no way for me to express my inner joy at finding that what Baba had 
shown me a few years before was now coming true. 

Years later, on 11 September 1990, Baba came out of the hospital and 
at midnight He called for me. While I was massaging Him, He asked me 
to talk quietly about something so that He would feel sleepy. 

"Baba, what you showed me in that demonstration in 1979 has come 
completely true now to the last detail. I had been wondering if the foun¬ 
tain would really be built, but it had come just as it was in the vision. 
Lastly the elevator was installed and reality was completely like my 
vision. I thought now I could tell everyone." 105 
"You are forgetting one feature of the things I showed you. Try to 
recollect." 

I tried and tried to remember, but I could not remember anything 
that was not already there in reality. I asked Baba to please tell me what 
it was that I had forgotten. 

"When the time comes, you will remember everything. You see, 
whatever happens I planned it all long ago. Whenever I take determina¬ 
tion for any purpose, that thing must happen and no one can stop it." 

The next month, Baba left His physical body. 

Recently I went to Madras to conduct a spiritual seminar. As I gave a 
talk about Baba, I suddenly remembered the missing element in my 
vision that Baba had referred to. Yes, after Baba's passing, all the Dadas 
and Didis wept in Baba's quarters for two days. None of us could speak 
even if we tried. We just looked at each other and wept. 

With You in Your room 

Tokyo. I miss Baba so much, that there is a constant ache in my 
chest. Early this morning, however, He relieved it slightly by a dream— 
my first dream of Him after His passing: 


105 The marriage of Baba's adopted son K inshuk had also been held. 


After having fieldwalk with Baba, I was with Him and several other 
workers in His room in Calcutta. A few minutes passed in normal dis¬ 
cussions, during which He smiled and joked. Then He turned to speak 
confidentially to me. 

He said, "What do you dearly want?" 

I looked up and saw my answer written in three-dimensional letters 
suspended in the air. I read this reply to Him, without understanding 
what I was saying. 

Understanding carries no weight, I thought. Only feeling matters. 
Only love matters. 

Baba spoke intimately with me, "But there is someone else, isn't 

there?" 

"There's no one else for me, Baba," I said. 

"What about that lady in your class?" He asked. 

It took me a moment, and then I knew whom He meant. I almost 
laughed, because my feeling for her was simply as a student. 

"No, it's nothing," I said. "Only You." 

He smiled. It was only playful lovers' talk, and of course He knew the 
truth. He hugged me tightly, and I began to cry, feeling I would again 
soon be separated from Him. 

"Please post me in India or anywhere that I can be close to You, 

Baba. I want to be with You in Your room." Now I remembered that this 
is what the three-dimensional letters said. So I added, "This is what I 
want more than anything else." 

He didn't reply, so I embraced Him more closely, completely, and 
went on crying. 

In this state I woke up, and indeed I was crying. My pillow was 
soaked in tears. I rubbed my face in those tears, and felt Him inside of 
me. 

And I knew this was His strange way of comforting me—for, though 
my throat swelled and tears flowed, the top of my head throbbed rhyth¬ 
mically and all the cells of my body quivered with His blissfulness. 

Our case with Amnesty temporarily rests 

1991. The woman from Amnesty International called me, saying, 
"I'm sorry, we have not yet received a reply from our London office 
concerning your case. I'm very concerned about the persecution in 
Ananda Nagar, so I intend to give London a big push. I thought to ask if 
you have any more information or documents you'd like to add." 


"I'm very thankful to you," I said, "but there's been a change. You 
see, in October, P.R. Sarkar, the propounder of Ananda Marga, passed 
away." 

"Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that." 

"No need to be sorry. There's benevolent purpose in everything. 

Since then, the daily attacks at Ananda Nagar have ceased. It's now 
completely peaceful, and we are free to engage in purely constructive 
work." 

"Oh, well, that's a great relief to me." 

"I might add that the violence stopped, I guess, because the com¬ 
munists believe Ananda Marga will crumble in the absence of Sarkar. 
But we always gain strength out of adverse conditions. The annual gath¬ 
ering in Ananda Nagar, which was concluded a few days ago, was even 
bigger than usual. More than 20,000 people attended. Many were new 
people who had not even seen Sarkar. So, I wouldn't be surprised if, 
after watching our development for a few months or so, the communists 
recommence their attacks against us." 

"Well, I sure hope not. In any case, I'll keep your files safe. Let me 
know if the trouble starts up again." 

"You will see it. But I will not." 

Taipei. A few days ago, Dada Pranavatmakananda interviewed Mr 
N.C. Ganguli, an old colleague of Baba's from the Jamalpur Railway 
accounts office. 106 He never learned meditation, though he held Baba 
in highest esteem. Ganguli said that daily after lunch many of the staff 
would gather around Baba's desk for discussion. Sometime in 1952, 

Baba was talking to them about communism. He said it was an inhu¬ 
mane philosophy, and therefore would not survive for long. It would 
eventually completely disappear from the world. Not only would com¬ 
munism face such a fate, even the Soviet Union itself would disintegrate. 

At that time Stalin's nation was a powerful force, so the statement 
was in every sense surprising. (Even now that communism is in trouble, 


106 Since shortly after Baba'spassing, Pranavatmakanandaji hashad a special duty which I 
envy. He is incharge of collecting the accounts of Baba-experiences from M argis, non-M argis 
and workers. The amount of material has so far been enormous— already hundreds of video 
tapes. We can guess that hiscompleted reports will contain sufficient new information for 
writing scores of booksabout Baba. 


it does not appear likely that the USSR will collapse.) So Ganguli asked, 
"Prabhat Ranjan, will we see all this within our lifetime?" Baba replied, 
"You will see it. But I will not." 107 

Pranavatmakanandaji also told me of another incident from that 
Jamalpur office. One of Baba's colleagues clearly remembered that 
around 1959, Baba told him, "In my family the longevity is not more 
than seventy years. My grandfather and my father both died early. So 
there is very little chance that I'll cross seventy. If I were to cross sev¬ 
enty, then I would personally show the world the power of my ideology. 
But there is very little chance of that." 

Baba died at the age of sixty-nine. 

Why He didn't allow me to meet H im in jail 

Komsomolsk, Russia. Some part of the first Vedas were composed in 
central Russia 15,000 years ago. 108 Those Aryan people migrated 
southeast, where they mixed their Vedic culture with the Tantric culture 
of the peoples of northeast India. Though the Aryans were an aggressive 
warlike people, they were knowledgable about spiritual philosophy. 

The effect of those days seems to remain here, because many Rus¬ 
sians are extremely thirsty for psychic and spiritual experience. I found 
them intelligent, dynamic, and usually responsible; and they are en¬ 
thusiastic about anything having an occult flavor. (That my picture of 
them should not appear over rosy, let me add that they also have a ten¬ 
dency toward over-argumentation and over-intellectualization.) 109 


107 Though Ganguli did indeed witness the disintegration of the U SSR the following December, 
at the time of this entry no one could confidently predict such a development. 

108 Veda means deep knowledge. The Vedic scriptures are the most ancient and voluminous of 
all the Indian spiritual literature. The Vedic writings are more philosophical and theoretical, 
while the Tantric texts are more practical. 

109 T0 make this picture even more complete I should mention that I later worked in M ongolia. 
Though most M ongoliansare not so desperate for spiritual knowledge like the Russians, they 
have a greater tendency toward a spiritually-centered lifestyle. Before communism took over 

M ongolia, it was nick-named " Little India" because of its affinity for spiritual culture. The 
people seem as simple as the renowned devotees from K rishna's time, who were cowherds. 



Epilogue 

Ananda Marga is growing at such speed that our workers must be 
careful not to pass most of their time only fulfilling requests to teach 
meditation or answering endless questions. The need for organizing 
social work is just as great. Fortunately, Margis of Japan and Taiwan are 
proving helpful in arranging medical equipment, clothing, and other 
donations. Local government bodies, clubs and organizations are also 
cooperative. In fact, for every offer of cooperation that we accept, there 
are many others that we are forced to reject due to our own limitations. 

Our new Margis hired a professional translator, who is regarded as 
the foremost English speaker of Khabarovsk. When we requested her to 
join our meditation, she hesitated and said, "I don't really think I am 
capable of such a thing." Eventually she did sit with us, for a full hour. 
Afterward she said, "There must be something wrong with me. I couldn't 
help crying throughout almost the entire meditation." Imagine, this lady 
who had not the slightest Tantric knowledge, has already had an 
awakening of the spiritual force in her spine. 

I remember what Baba told me during a walk in Germany in 1979: 

"In the future, big spiritual festivals will be held in both Moscow and 
Beijing." At the time I could not imagine how our programs could be 
openly held in the two countries which most represented the suppression 
of spirituality. 

Khabarovsk, Russia. During a question-and-answer session with a 
group of Margis, a sister said, "It is clear to all of us that Dadas and Didis 
possess immense devotion for Baba. Some of us also feel a little love for 
Him. But how can we ever hope to achieve a deep communion with 
Guru, when we are unable to meet Him? You were lucky. We are un¬ 
lucky." 

Before replying, I momentarily thought of Baba, as I always try to do 
before any action, and, without expecting it, a flood of energy rose in my 
spine. All my cells tingled as the answer thrust itself before my eyes—an 
answer I had searched for so long. There was that question that 
remained unanswered within me for so many years: Why had He caused 
me such intense suffering by not allowing me to meet Him during my 
first seven years as a worker? Why did He stop me that day I was 
determined to break into His Patna prison cell? Why did He pull me into 
a trance while sitting in the prison office during which He psychically stroked my head and said, "There is a very good reason why 
I am not allowing you to meet me... a very good reason". I finally knew 
the reason! It was for the sake of people who would never be able to 
physically meet Him, to whom I could say with uncontrived conviction: 
"Relation with Guru is a purely spiritual matter. Meeting Him was 
beautiful, but it carries no guarantee. Though my words may sound 
trite, I can only repeat, the true Guru, the eternal lover, the eternal 
guide, the eternal One—is within you. But He is a jealous lover, who will 
only embrace you if you truly care for Him." 

And when such people say, "But, Dada, that's only philosophy- 
then I explain my experience. I offer my Baba story. Though it is a story 
which is far from finished.
