## Graced by disgrace 

One of the new Margis asked me if I knew that some of the neighbors were 
disturbed by our yoga house, and had complained to our real estate agent. 

"No," I said. "What's their grievance?" 

"They said it's disgraceful that both blacks and whites are coming into this 
house together." 

I laughed, and said, "We're already having a good effect on the neighborhood." 

Just love me 

A friend invited me to a seance yesterday conducted by a lady who claims 
to be a spirit medium. At the seance she entered into a trance which enabled her 
to "channel the spirit" by automatic writing. She instructed me to mentally ask 
a question without speaking it aloud. Though I do not believe that the spirits of 
the dead are able to communicate from a bodiless condition, still I admit that a 
"medium" may be in touch with the unconscious mind, and thus may reflect 
otherwise unrevealed information. 

I thought, "What should I do about the trouble I'm getting every time after 
meditation?" For some weeks I've felt terribly exhausted at the end of 
meditation, and usually have to rest a few minutes afterward. 

The lady's hand wrote, "Do not worry. It is not bad. It will end in ten days." 



Just Love Me

Ten days later. The problem of exhaustion continued unabated, though 1 
didn't give a single thought to the medium's message. 

Yesterday I went to the University of Mississippi in Oxford to begin a 
three-day lecture program for which I had been invited. Before going to deliver 
my speech, I did meditation. As usual, I became sleepy during meditation. But 
this time the fatigue was so great that I found myself sleeping on my back 
without even intending to lie down. 

Angry with myself, I sat up to resume meditation. After a short time, 1 
again fell asleep and had a powerful dream: 

I was in India with a small group of American Margis. We were sitting in 
an auditorium together with hundreds of other Margis. Baba was on the stage, 
speaking. One by one. He called our names, asking each of the Americans to 
come on stage to be welcomed and embraced. 

When He had called every name but mine, I became frustrated. Then Baba 
walked off the stage and came over to me. He raised his foot and slowly 
pushed the sole of His shoe toward my face. As I watched, terrified. Baba's 
form changed: He became the most abominable insect that I could imagine— 
complete with claws and fangs. 

I wanted to run away, but was frozen in fear. Though I tried to scream, 
nothing came out. Then I heard a voice coming from nowhere: "Just love Me." 

My fear broke a bit as I wondered about the voice. Again it came, "Just 
love Me." I followed its command, and tried to love Baba in the form of that 
hideous insect. Gradually the insect disappeared and was replaced by a faint 
white light. My love grew deeper, and the light became bright and warm. 

For a moment my love subsided, and the black bug began to appear again. 
This time, however, I felt no loathing, and easily rekindled my love. The light 
returned, far brighter than the sun. though it didn't hurt my eyes. All my 
anxieties drowned in an endless bliss. 

I awoke and thought, "I must never forget this lesson. Everyone and 
everything is His manifestation. Even the worst and vilest forms." 

I feel that this dream has released some deep, old tension. Last night and 
this morning the problem of exhaustion after meditation didn't appear. Exactly 
ten days after the medium gave her message.

You Have To Work For Your Realization 

The plan to leave Ananda Marga 

Jackson. 1972. I have decided to leave Ananda Marga. Why? To answer 
this, I put another question: is it correct to meditate on the idea "I am God"? 
Day by day I am convincing myself of this statement, though honestly I know 
nothing. My purpose in following a spiritual path should be to go beyond my 
limited beliefs and realize the truth. Whether or not the idea "I am God" is right 
or wrong, I don't know. Maybe this idea also is just a belief. 

I shall go to an uninhabited place, leave all my worldly possessions behind, 
and throw myself open to Being. Before joining Ananda Marga I did this sort 
of exercise several times. But this time it won't be for a few days only. Why 
should I trap myself with any kind of dogma? 

Unfortunately, I am bound to stay in Jackson three more weeks because 
Dada Yatishvarananda is coming here, and I'm responsible for setting up his 
programs. As soon as his visit is finished, I'll leave. 

Three weeks later. Over the last ten days, I haven't done Ananda Marga 
meditation. I simply sit four times daily, trying to think of nothing. 

When he arrived today, Dada Yatishvarananda said. "Your face is drained 
of light. What's troubling you?" 

"Dadaji, I want to leave my post just after your visit is finished. To 
continue would be hypocrisy." I explained my dilemma, and why I had to go. 

He tried to help me. but nothing he suggested did any good. Finally he 
said, "We will do all of our meditations together for three days, and your 
questions will be answered." I doubt it.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


During these three weeks, though I had no personal interest in the work, 1 
did it efficiently. One hundred and fifty people came to the lecture tonight—a 
grand success. Is it possible that I was efficient not despite my non-interest but 
because of it, because of the absence of anxious expectation? 

Two days later. Today was Dadaji's final day here. I've been so busy these 
past three days that I've had no time to worry about whether I'm correct or 
incorrect. But just before Dadaji's departure, I had nothing to do for a few 
minutes except sit and wait for him to get ready. It was then I noticed that I was 
feeling fine, very fine. What happened? I don't know. But I told Dadaji. "I'll 
stay at least a few more days ... to find out the cause of my good feeling." 

Two days later. Today my intellect caught up with my feelings and 1 
understood. I had been thinking it was a dogma and blind belief to meditate on 
"I am God". But in fact I don't even know what is "I", what is "am", and, 
though I'm aware of an infinite Entity, I certainly don't know what It or "God" 
is. These words, this system—it's not the point. Even if I try to think of nothing 
and be open, it's also a system. We cannot avoid walking in some sort of 
direction, both physically and mentally. 

My purpose is clear. Ananda Marga stands for self-realization and service 
to others. (It is trying to do good in every conceivable manner. So I'll continue 
with it, unless and until—unless and until what? Plainly speaking, I think 
nothing could ever cause me to leave, unless I found that Baba Himself was 
false. 

The curtain opens on a great drama 

February. A mind-wrenching circular arrived from our office in Wichita. 
Baba is in jail in India. It states: 

Though Baba was arrested on 29th December, we delayed to inform you in 
the hope that He would soon be released. But it's taking time. Together with 
four workers, He is charged with conspiracy to murder. Of course it's a frame- 
up manufactured by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) to crush Ananda 
Marga. The ideas and ac

tivities of AM have always been a direct threat to public figures who hunger for 
personal power without concern to benefit the society.... 

The sole direct witness is Vishokananda, an ex-Dada who claims to have 
been one of the murderers. Instead of being in jail, however, he is free and 
enjoying luxurious living standards. His evidence is acceptable according to a 
fluke in Indian law which permits a criminal to testify against others, in which 
case he is called the Approver. According to the discretion of the court, the 
Approver may be released and richly rewarded for his cooperation. 

The four so-called murder victims found in a forest are unidentifiable. The 
post-mortem cannot even determine if they are male or female.... 

There is not one piece of authentic evidence in the case, and therefore our 
lawyers expect Baba and the co-accused to be acquitted very soon.... 

Baba is not only unperturbed by His incarceration. He was clearly prepared 
for it. When the police came to His house on the 29th to arrest Him. they 
proposed that they wait a few hours for Him to arrange His suitcases. He 
replied, "I was expecting you. and am already packed. Let us proceed without 
delay." 

Strange as it may sound, I am encouraged by this news. If the CBI is 
prepared to undergo such trouble to try to stop us. it proves Ananda Marga is 
doing excellent work. It goes without saying that the prosecution will 
eventually fail. This drama promises to be interesting. 

All night all right 

A few days ago, I read an inspirational book that mentioned the mind's 
capacity to maintain the continuous repetition of mantra even while sleeping. 
Tonight while lying in my bed, I concentrated on my mantra as I fell asleep. 

In the morning I had a wondrous experience. I had not the slightest of my 
normal tiredness on waking, and instead felt as if I was simply passing from 
one state of mind into another. I could distinctly recall the presence of my 
mantra all night, as if it was playing a witnessing role throughout all of my 
dreams. Because my awareness was identified with the mantra, I had watched 
my dreams as a kind of spectator. 

I am beginning to tap into an entity of infinite perspectives.

The Lord resorts to extreme measures 

Another volunteer, Paul, has been working with me these last few weeks. 
Today he left for India to undergo training to become a Dada. I thought it was 
a mistake, and tried to tell him so, but he refused to listen or talk about it. 

Paul has a wife and two small children who live in New York. He did not 
divorce his wife, but only left her for the sake of the spiritual work. I don't like 
this. I even asked him directly once, "Paul, what about your wife and children? 
Are you thinking to communicate with them?" He gave me such a scowl that I 
dared not mention it again. 

Throughout his stay here, his behavior was strange. He was almost always 
silent, and barely helped except physically. When he sat in meditation, he 
moved constantly, often groaning in psychic discomfort. Surely he is 
suppressing much. On the other hand, it does seem he loves our mission, and 
wants to do something noble with his life. 

Two months later. I received a long-distance telephone call today from a 
government officer in Washington D.C. He said. "Do you know Mr. Paul 
Stockman?" 

"Yes." 

"He wrote your name in his passport in case of accident, and, well, he's had 
a serious one." 

"Where? What happened?" 

"He was found unconscious, suffering from head wounds and a concussion in 
an alley in New Delhi. India." "Oh God." 

"His wallet was gone, so we guess that he was attacked and robbed." "What do 
you mean 'we guess'? What does Paul say happened?" "He doesn't remember 
what happened. In fact, ah, he doesn't remember anything. The doctors say he 
has almost total amnesia." "Wow! How..." 

"And that's why I'm calling you now. He's in a hospital in New Delhi, and 
we would like to know if he has any family to whom he should return. It's 
preferable he receive treatment near his own home." 

Luckily I happened to have his original address in New York City 
Including his wife's name. I read it to the officer, and asked him to inform me 
when Paul arrives in New York, and in which hospital he's staying. 



You Have to Work For Your Realization

Five days later. Paul arrived in New York yesterday. I called him at the 
hospital. He's still a bit weak, but said that small bits and pieces of his memory 
have returned so that he can vaguely remember me and his family. His voice, 
however, sounded different. He always used to speak in an artificially subdued 
manner. Today, though his voice was weak, it was, nevertheless clear and 
unrestrained, except due to the uncertainty of his memory. 

The end of our talk was interesting. 

"I'm thinking to go to India soon," I said. "Maybe I can pass through New York 
on my way." "Thafll be great!" he said. "Did your wife visit you yet?" "Yeah." 

"Are you thinking to return ... to your home soon?" 

"The doctors say I may be able to leave within a week or so." 

"You mean you'll go home then?" 

"Of course. Do you suggest any other place ?" 

"No, no, that'll be perfect." 

1 don't think he caught my delighted surprise. Here was a guy who was so 
sincerely and forcefully running the wrong way, that the only means by which 
Baba could correct him was a knock on the head. 

He's the problem. He's the solution 

I've run out of money. When it's happened before, I've always taken a short¬ 
term job: as a taxi driver, an accountant, a government census taker, a 
manufacturer of alfalfa sprouts, a Santa Claus handing candy to children in a 
department store. 

But this time it's different. We have two major social service programs which 
will collapse if I withdraw from them in order to earn money. First we are busy 
arranging a public concert to raise funds for the famine-stricken population of 
Bangladesh. 11 Second is a twice-weekly cooking class for poor people, to teach 
them how to prepare nutritious tasty food on a minimal budget. 


11 This program turned out to be the largest outdoor-concert ever held in M ississippi until then. 



51 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I've told my problem to nobody, except Baba, and to Him I said and say, "I 
am working for You only, offering everything for You. This yoga house is 
Yours, and these projects are Yours. I shall not jeopardize the projects by 
taking a job. If I don't have money to pay for the center, it's Your problem. 
Baba, not mine. If I end up in the street homeless, it's okay for me; it might 
even be interesting." 

There's no trouble getting food because I'm receiving government food 
stamps. 

Three weeks later. The rent is due tomorrow, and I still don't have the 
money. Baba, be careful. It's Your loss not mine if I can't pay the rent. That 
will be a good lesson for You. 

Two days later. I suppose any moment the real estate company will call me, 
and ask for the rent. I'm ready to leave. The joke's on You. Baba. 

One day later. Today a letter arrived from Chris. Since he went to Eugene 
to study nine months ago. I've had no contact with him. 

He writes: "Everyone at the university here was fed up with the movies 
arranged weekly by the University Cultural Affairs Office. So Larry and I 
began booking first-class films on our own. We charged our audiences a 
nominal fee, thinking only to recover our expenditure. Without expecting it, we 
pulled in some profit. When I was thinking what to do with this money, I 
suddenly thought of you. I've got a feeling you could put it to better use than 
anyone I know." 

Inside was a check for $210, exactly enough money for the next three 
months rent. As I walked to the real estate office I laughed. Good joke. Baba. 

An ancient yogi makes trouble 

Dadaji is here for his second visit. Again, plenty of people are attending the 
lectures and learning meditation. 

One man, about 50 years old, came to our door, saying, "I saw the sign on 
your house: Ananda Marga Yoga Society. What does it mean?" 

He had never heard of yoga. I took a few minutes to explain a little to him, 
and he immediately wanted to learn. 



You Have to Work For Your Realization

"I think it'll be better," I said, "if you first attend a lecture and read some of 
our books. You don't know what you're getting into." 

"But this is my only chance. Tomorrow I go out of Jackson for one month. 
Please leave the risk to me." Hesitantly, I agreed to schedule a meeting with 
Dadaji. 

Immediately after his initiation he did long meditation—nearly one hour. 
Then he came to me and said, "I must see Dadaji again." 

"I'm sorry, Dadaji's doing his own meditation now, so you'll have to wait." 
"But I have an appointment; I can't wait. I've got a problem with the meditation. 
At least let me explain it to you." "I'm not qualified to deal with these matters." 
"Look, you've got to listen!" I shrugged my shoulders. 

"From the first moment, my meditation was very pleasant. But after some 
time a tall bearded Indian dressed in white appeared in my mind." He 
demonstrated the sitting position of the Indian which was a yoga posture for 
doing higher meditation. 

He continued, "I was doing meditation on the mantra which I learned from 
Dadaji. But the Indian man in my mind was loudly repeating a different 
mantra." 

He told me the "different mantra". It was strange and unknown to 

me. 

"A conflict rose in me," he said. "I didn't know which mantra to use. It 
created a heavy tension, which was painful. Finally I decided that since my 
meditation had led me to the vision of this Indian man, I should follow him. So 
I started repeating his mantra. Immediately I felt wonderful, as I've never felt 
before. Do you agree that I am doing the right thing?" 

I did not agree. "In my opinion you should continue only with the mantra 
you learned from Dadaji. I believe this vision is coming from your distant past. 
Perhaps from past lives. But I'm not sure, so please telephone me tonight, and 
in the meantime I'll ask Dadaji." 

Dadaji agreed with me, so when the man called, I suggested he continue to 
follow Dadaji's instructions only.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Next day. The man I wrote about yesterday is a traveling salesman who 
sells equipment to farmers. Tonight he called again saying, "I'm finding the 
meditation experience too taxing. That Indian yogi still appears every time I sit 
and loudly chants his mantra. What should I do?" 

"As we already told you, please keep on struggling." Of course that was 
easy to say, but. 

Next day. The salesman called again late tonight. He said. "As usual the 
yogi entered my meditation this evening. This time, however, it was absolutely 
hellish. He applied such a power on me that it seemed unbearable. Somehow I 
continued with my mantra. Just when I thought I would explode if I continued 
even one second longer, he exploded! His clothing, flesh, blood, even bones 
burst apart in every direction-nothing remained except a bright blissful 
luminosity. It was beautiful beyond words. I felt that all my worries and fears 
were gone. Did I merge in God?" 

Two weeks later. The salesman called me again. He said, "I feel guided. 
Almost every farm I go to I find either the husband or the wife is particularly 
interested in meditation. And so I teach him or her the universal mantra 12 . Is it 
okay?" 

"It's more than okay," I said. "It's perfect." 

Now I understand why this man had such difficulties in his meditation—to 
strengthen his mind for the work of reaching these farmers who would 
otherwise never come in contact with Ananda Marga. 

N ew education techniques 

All of my social service responsibilities were taken over today by a new 
volunteer who will soon replace me. On a whim I visited a local primary school 
to see if I could help in any way. By their shabby clothing it was obvious that 
the children were from poor families. Almost all of them were black. A 
secretary in the administrative office told me 1 was free to look around. As I 
walked through the hallways I heard children talking, laughing and yelling 
through every door. 


‘■'The universal mantra is Baba Nam Kevalam 



You Have to Work For Your Realization

When I entered a classroom for nine year-olds, I found nothing short of 
chaos. Not only were all the children busy in loud games of their own, ignoring 
the teacher, some were chasing others around the room, knocking over chairs, 
desks, whatever got in their way. Meanwhile, the teacher was sitting at her 
desk, reading something. I approached her. 

"Excuse me, ma'am," I said, "I wonder if there is any way I could help 
you." 

She looked up, surprised. "Well, that's right kind of yo'all," she said to me. 
"Alrightee, thank yo'all. I'll just be on down to the lounge for a cup of coffee, 
and yo'all can take over the class." 

Before I could express my astonishment, she stood up and left the room. 
The students didn't even notice. 

I looked at all of them, sat down at the teacher's desk, and closed my eyes. 
As I thought of Baba, an idea entered my head. 

"Children!" I said loudly above all their racket. 

Most of them spun around and shouted, "Yes!" 

"Would you like to play a game?" 

"Yes!" 

"Okay. Come and sit down near to me." 

Immediately they all ran forward, pushing and knocking against each other, 
laughing and arguing over who could sit nearest to me. A desk was knocked 
down, and a new fist-fight erupted for a few moments. 

"This is a very special game you never played before. Are you sure you want to 
do it?" "Yes!" 

"But you have to be very different than usual to play it. Can you really do 
that?" "Yes!" 

I dropped my voice low and said, "You'll have to be very very quiet to 
play. I don't think you can do that. Do you really think you can play this special 
game?" 

"Yes!" they yelled in a whisper. 

Two boys pushed each other. Pointing at them, I said, "You two can play a 
different game, it's okay. You go over to that corner, and play your own game." 



You Have to Work For Your Realization 


55 


The two jumped up and ran to the far corner of the room. For about ten 
seconds they pushed each other. Then they sat down and looked at the rest of 
us. 

"Now, I want you all to close your eyes for a moment." 

they all shut their eyes. Taking advantage of the situation, one boy pulled 
the ears of another boy, who turned around and pulled the pig-tails of a girl. 

"Open your eyes," I said. I directed the two pullers to go and play their 
game in the comer. Like the first two, they ran at full speed to the comer, were 
raucous for a few seconds, and then sat quietly looking at us. 

"Now, this time when you close your eyes, I want you to imagine 
something that you like more than anything else in the world." 

Again they closed their eyes. No sound, no movement. Even the boys in 
the comer closed their eyes. 

After about ten seconds I said, "Okay very good. Open your eyes. What 
did you see?" 

"Chocolate cake!" 

"Mary Sue!" 

"A miniature electric train!" 

Their answers went on until I heard "Presents around the Christmas tree!" 

"Stop!" I said, holding up my hand. "You all did very nicely. Let's take one 
of these: presents around the Christmas tree. I like that too. Have any of you 
seen snow?" 

"Yes,” they all said. 

"Mas anyone never seen snow?" 

Silence. Even though Jackson is a hot place, I guess they'd all seen snow, 
at least on television. 

"Okay, great. Now let's all think about Christmas, boys and girls. Yes, 
close your eyes again. Good. Now imagine it's really Christmas, and you're 
sitting at home in front of the fireplace because it's cold outside and it's 
snowing. You feel nice and cozy by the fire, and you look out the window and 
see all that snow falling. And it's so beautiful. Lots and lots of white white 
snow. Now your body becomes very small, and very light, and you float out 
the window, and you're float 



56 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


ing in the snowflakes, and you feel so happy and light and white. And 
you go higher and higher in the beautiful snowflakes, and you're all 

alone. And then you see the sun shining. And you float toward the sun. 
It's great, it's fun, it's beautiful. And you're flying toward the sun, riding 
on the sun's rays. And everywhere is light and light and more light. 
And your body is full of light. And your mind is full of light. And 

you're becoming a ray of light. And you mix with that light, and enjoy 
it. Ah, it's so beautiful, and you feel better than ever in your life, and 
so quiet and peaceful and happy. And you feel that you love every¬ 
body. And you feel you're a ray of love. It's so beautiful. You're so 

beautiful and loving and love, only love, only love..." 

Toward the end my voice became softer and softer until it faded 

away. I meditated with them for about fifteen seconds. Then I opened 
my eyes. They were all pin-drop quiet, sitting with eyes closed, includ¬ 
ing the boys in the corner. 

"Okay," I whispered. "Very good. Open your eyes slowly." 

Most of them opened their eyes, though a few kept them closed. 
Their eyes glistened, and their faces shone. 

"You're very beautiful children," I said. "You're so full of love. I 
love you, and I'm sure God loves you too. And I'm sure you love ev¬ 
erybody. So ... what do you like to say now?" 

"I love everybody," one boy said. 

"Me too! Me too! I love everybody!" came a chorus of voices. 

Just in that moment the teacher appeared at the door. Her eyes 
opened wide, and she raised her arms. 

"I can't believe it," she said. As she walked in, the children looked at her, and 
started chitchatting lightly between themselves. She came up to me. 

"How did you manage to get them like this?" Before I 

could answer, the school bell rang. "Ask them." I said. 

Yesterday and today I went again to that school. The same teacher asked me 
to come to her classroom, saying that her children had been much quieter and 
nicer after my visit. But I told her I wanted to try other classrooms. 



57 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I did more or less the same in two more classes with good results. But for 
today's class I also taught them to sing Baba Nam Kevalam. It was even better, 
because there's hardly anything kids like more than singing. 

All the teachers in the school heard about these programs, and many of 
them requested me to come to their classrooms. 

When I told them I'm leaving Mississippi this week, they were dis¬ 
appointed. 

Don't move! 

As I began morning meditation, a thought crossed my mind: "I shall be 
inflexibly rigid. No matter what uneasiness I feel, I shall not move." 

Until today, each and every time I practiced meditation, I inevitably shifted 
my weight or my legs a few times. Though I knew I should not move, I never 
adhered strictly to the system. 

This time, however, when itching asked for scratching, nervous tension 
demanded release, and pain shouted for relief—I did not give in. Though it was 
very difficult, I didn't move even a fraction of an inch. Slowly, all the mental 
and physical chatter lessened, and finally ceased. My mind sunk deep into 
meditation, and I achieved a consciousness previously unknown to me. 

A simple, effective technique: don't move a muscle! Isn't it odd that 1 didn't 
try it before? 

Instant bliss 

On the Greyhound bus north. I'm traveling to Chicago. From Chicago I'll 
go to India to meet Baba and try to find out whether or not I should become an 
acharya 13 . The Jackson center is now in the hands of another volunteer. 

Chicago. One week later. My sister's getting married this week. The 
ceremony will be at our house, and scores of near and distant family members 
are either here or on their way. 


13 Acharya is the formal title of the teachers of Ananda M arga—the Dadas and Didis. Acharan 
means conduct. Acharya means one who teaches others through his or her personal conduct.

Yesterday, two of my cousins and I went to a public meeting of an Indian 
spiritual movement just starting in America. The main attraction was the 
mother of the guru, together with the two leading teachers of the movement— 
all of whom are supposed to be living saints. The guru is still in India. The 
lecture had already started when we arrived. We slipped in at the back of the 
room, which was packed with about 200 people. The teacher who was lecturing 
turned toward me and stared. He kept his eyes fixed on me even while singing. 
But was he really looking at me? To find out, I moved to other sides of the hall. 
His eyes remained glued on me until the end—about one hour. 

When the lecture finished, I was curious, to say the least. About ten 
disciples were there, and it seemed all had noticed the teacher staring at me. 
They also seemed to be wondering why. I requested an interview. 

The teacher said to me, "We are leaving Chicago just now. Come to the 
airport, and we will talk there." 

Together with several disciples, my cousins and I drove to the airport. After 
checking in. the two teachers and the mother took me aside, alone. 

"Who are you?" they asked. 

"I'm going to India in a few days. I'm an Ananda Margi." 

They laughed uproariously. I was shocked. 

"Oh, Ananda Marga! Violent, dangerous people! You must have nothing to 
do with them." 

I asked for the source of their malicious information. They spoke of various 
so-called scandals, but added nothing convincing. 

Then they said, "Whether you believe in Ananda Marga doesn't matter. The 
important fact is we give you Cosmic Knowledge instantly. You will see Light 
and hear Music." 

"Okay. Please give me the initiation here now," I said. 

"No, no. You meet us in Denver. We will hold big seminar there. You must 
join and then you receive initiation." 

"I'm going to India. Why should I change? How can I know if your 
Knowledge is correct or not?" 

For twenty minutes they tried to persuade me. 

At the end of that time, two sentences finally struck me: "We are opening 
doorway to God. You should at least try." I couldn't deny that. 



59 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I immediately canceled my flight to India, and re-booked for Denver 
reasoning that I could always go to India later if their promises proved empty. 

In the evening, I arrived home with my cousins. They were excited and I 
was inspired. Everyone was pleased when they heard that I would be staying in 
America. Only my father was frustrated. 

"How could you change your mind so easily?" he asked. "Looks like your 
commitment was not so deep as you made it out to be." 

As the evening wore on, a strange feeling developed. Something was 
wrong, though I had no idea what. "What is it, God? How am I failing You?" I 
thought. 

Confusion overtook me. Struggling to get free, the anxiety only increased. I 
asked Baba and God to save me. At last I fell asleep, fully prostrate, praying for 
guidance. 

When I woke up this morning at 6:00 a.m., I was still lying in the same 
position. I had been dreaming and the meaning of the dream seemed 
unmistakably clear. Thrilled to the bone, I jumped up to phone Dada Birendra 
Lai. 14 

I quickly told him about yesterday's experience. Then I told him my dream: 

"Dadaji, I was in India in a room with about forty or fifty people. Baba sat 
in the front, facing us and speaking. We all knew that Bindeshwari was in the 
next room. You know, the Bindeshwari who died and was brought back to life 
by Baba's touch, and who now has miraculous psychic powers." 

"Yes, yes. I know him very well." 

"Well, we could hear many persons in that room being affected by 
Bindeshwari's touch on their foreheads—they were shouting, sighing, and 
gasping as they entered into high states of consciousness. It seemed that each of 
us in the room with Baba was thinking, T wish I were there', 

14 At this time there were three Dadas, or acharyas, in the USA. One was a renunciate (Dada 
Yatishvarananda, the Dada who taught me meditation), and the other two were married. Dada 
Birendra Lai was a family man, employed in Chicago as an engineer. In the beginning years of 
Ananda M arga, all the acharyas were family people. The renunciate or monk system only came 
later. The two family acharyas were from the original group, and thus had long experience on 
the spiritual path. While maintaining his normal family responsibilities Dada Birendra also 
guided our Chicago meditation group. The third Dada, also married, lived and worked in 
Philadelphia. 



You Have to Work For Your Realization

as we all looked at the wall separating us from ecstasy. Only Baba was 
unimpressed. He turned toward the wall and yelled through it, 'Will you little 
children please be quiet!' In that same moment I woke up. 

"Doesn't it show, Dadaji, that Baba doesn't give much importance to such 
psychic phenomena? Surely it would be worse than a waste of time for me to go 
to Denver, just running after occult experience. I think I have to give myself to 
God, not try to get something for myself. Isn't is so, Dada?" 

"In 1955," Dada replied, "one devotee said to Baba, We've received 
everything by Your grace. Baba. Why don't you give bliss to everyone in the 
world right now? Why wait?' He said, T have not come to give instant bliss. 
That would defeat the purpose of life. Your purpose is to realize love-for- 
everyone-and-everything. You have to work for that.'" 

I canceled the ticket for Denver and re-booked for India. 15 

Don't thank me 

On the way to India I spent one day in New York City. I arranged to meet 
Paul at a bus stop near his house. When I stepped off the bus. he was standing 
about 150 meters away. When he saw me, his face lit up with a big smile. In 
Mississippi I had never seen him smile even once. He ran toward me and we 
embraced. 

The first thing he blurted out was, "You'll never believe it! In the last days 
I've been strongly desiring to do meditation, but couldn't remember my mantra, 
lust now as I saw you, I suddenly remembered it! Thank you. thank you. thank 
you!" 


15 Though Bindeshwari did clinically die, according to yoga it is possible that he never actually 
died. Yoga says that death is a process in which ultimately both the nerve cells and fibers die. 
There are, however, some cases in which only the nerve fibers die, but the nerve cel Is continue to 
live. Doctors declare that person to be clinically dead. This might have been Bindeshwari's 
situation. 

Baba did several times demonstrate that a person whose nerve fibers were dead but nerve 
cells alive could be restored to life, a phenomenon which medical science has not yet understood. 

Bindeshwari had some ability to raise the consciousness of others by his touch. It is a 
common occult power which is accessible to advanced spiritual aspirants. Though this same 
occult power was displayed by Baba innumerable times, He often explained the science behind 
it, together with the dangers inherent in misusing the power.

Sickness and depression: catalytic agents 

New Delhi, India. May. The latest news regarding Baba's court case is that 
there is no news. The strategy of the opposition is obviously to delay in the 
hope that over time Margis, Dadas and Didis will become frustrated, and 
gradually our mission will crumble. They cannot understand that such 
difficulties only make us stronger. 

Weather is super hot. Fantastic mango milk shakes. Drank four in one go. 

(Next day, on the train to Patna) ... and became sick as a dog. I never 
experienced before such strong diarrhea and nausea. An Indian Dada with long 
black hair and a thick beard (like almost all Dadas) tried to help but there was 
little he could do. 

Patna. I've been so sick that I could neither stand up nor sleep. It's 
blistering hot. My head is totally spaced out. To top it off, nobody is allowed to 
meet Baba in the jail. 

The fact that I cannot see Baba only adds to my depression and confusion. 
I've come to India to determine my life's direction, perhaps to become a monk, 
but how will I manage to clear up anything without meeting my guru? Now 
many doubts arise. 

Today during one of my half-unconscious periods a Dada said, "Pack your 
things and come with me. I will take you to the proper place."

Without thinking, I obeyed him. Later he introduced himself as Dada 
Svarupananda. 

Now I am on a train heading for a place called Ananda Nagar. 

A mystic land 

Ananda Nagar, Purulia District. The journey lasted overnight dur¬ 
ing which I fell asleep for the first time in four days. This morning we 
arrived at a tiny station in the Indian countryside. No one got on or 
off except the two of us. One station attendant met us; otherwise there 
wasn't a soul in sight. The station signboard said Pundag. My body is 
still very weak and it took all the effort I could muster to begin walk¬ 
ing over what seemed like an endless desert. 

When we got down, Dada turned to me and said, "Welcome to 
Ananda Nagar. This is the most spiritual land in the world. Though 
our global camp office is in Patna, Ananda Nagar is the permanent 
central office of Ananda Marga." 

As I looked around me, the air broke in sparkling waves. Was it the heat 
waves, my delirium, or something mystical? No grass—just barren land, big and 
small rocks of all shapes strangely juxtaposed, and a few scattered, hardy trees. 

After walking for some time, a long building appeared—crude, un-decorated, 
painted dirty white. A couple of small boys were hitting a dilapidated rag ball 
back and forth, using tree branches as bats. 

"This is the primary school," Dada said. "Most of the children are inside 
studying." 

We walked on until we came to a well. He pulled up a bucket. 

"Drink this water," he said. "It will help you to get your health back." 

I doubted it, but drank. The water seemed to contain the same spar kling 
quality as the air, full of... what? life? I looked inside the well. A few frogs 
jumped here and there at the bottom. 

Farther on, a similar building came into view. "This is the high, school," he 
said. Concrete steps led us to the second (and highest) floor. We entered a room 
furnished only with a primitive chair and a plain wooden table with some 
scattered papers on it. 

"This is my room. You'll stay here for a few days." 

Clearing the table, he covered it with a bed sheet. I lay down in the heat and 
fell asleep.

Vanishing clouds 

For the last two days I've rested, randomly walked short distances, ate rice 
and boiled vegetables, and drank plenty of well-water. I guess the frogs didn't 
contribute anything harmful to the water because my health returned today. 

This afternoon Dada Svarupananda and another Dada took me to a slightly 
distant spot within Ananda Nagar. We sat down under an old tree with a thick, 
weathered trunk. 

We sang kiirtan for a short time and then started meditation. One minute, 
two minutes, three, four, five... the time passed, but not a single stray thought 
appeared to bother me. At last one thought bubbled up: "Ah ... so that's what 
concentration is!" 

Perhaps two hours passed in nearly unbroken concentration. It was by far 
the deepest meditation I've ever experienced. The few moments of wandering 
thoughts contained some of my doubts about Ananda Marga and becoming a 
monk: the risk inherent in commitment, the condemnation by those who don't 
understand, uncertainty about whether or not Ananda Marga is really a selfless, 
purely spiritual mission. But in the light of a suddenly opened mind these 
concerns appeared trivial. Like tiny wisps of clouds that disappear in the 
brilliant sun and blue sky, my doubts vanished. 

When I finished meditation, I told the two Dadas about my experience. 

They smiled warmly and said, "The area around this tree is a Tantra Piitha. 
Several highly developed Tantrics achieved liberation while doing meditation 
here. A strong vibration remains, which affects any person who meditates on 
this spot. There are seventy-eight such Tantra Piithas in Ananda Nagar." 16 

As I write now in the late night by lamplight, I feel changed. A few small 
doubts still linger, but I have hope that even without seeing Baba I may be able 
to reach the clear understanding I seek. 


26 Tan means crudeness; tra means liberation. So Tantra means the practical science by which one 
gradually becomes free from crude consciousness. There is a short article introducing Tantra in the 
appendices.

Transcendental core 

Noontime. Walking together with two Dadas across a limitless sandy 
expanse of stray underbrush, without a building or a tree in sight. Grit crunching 
under our sandaled footsteps, echoing in our silence. The droning of a myriad 
unseen insects combining together to create the sound of endlessness. The sun 
particularly intense, penetrating my skull, frying my brain. Gradually my 
thoughts dissipated. Though my feet moved on, my mind slipped ... swam ... 
forgot... mindlessly walking without time... nothingness.... 

Suddenly I awoke from my numbness. Awake, yet without any bearings or 
reference points. 

Where am I? I thought. Who are these two people? What year, what age is 
this? And who am I? 

I looked at them and at the land around, but understood nothing. I struggled 
to find any association. 

Then I felt my memory jar and gradually seem to return. These two with long 
black beards and swaying robes—holy men. This land-Palestine. This age—the 
age of Jewish and Christian patriarchs. I be- came calmer. A minute or so passed 
like this. 

But who am I? I thought. I looked down at my clothing. Shocking! These 
strange clothes did not fit my memory. Again I was thrown into confusion. 

Ah, yes, of course, I thought, as the idea of the real present returned. Ananda 
Nagar, India, two Dadas, I, an American... How strange... 

I was amazed at the mistake into which I had momentarily slipped. 

Yes, these Ananda Marga acharyas might as well be ancient reli¬ 
gious holy men.... 

A fresh understanding dawned. Another doubt was dislodged! I inhaled 
deeply in relief: by merging my life's energies into Ananda Marga I was not 
leaving the religious heritage inherited at the moment of my birth. Rather I was 
returning to its spiritual essence, full of the original vitality which existed before 
the religious dogma seeped in and a/en-tually took over. 

I am not turning away from my lineage. This Tantric path is the 
transcendental core from which every religion arises.

Message of an unknown Dada 

I am in Benares today for the start of a three-day spiritual festival led by the 
venerable Dada Shivananda. In the absence of Baba, Shivanandaji is serving as 
His representative, and his discourses will channel Baba's vibration. About 
10.000 Margis are attending, and the energy is high. 

It is also in this ancient spiritual city that we have our training centers for 
creating new acharyas. Our philosophy argues against the superstitious idol 
worship of Hinduism, but I agree with the Hindus that Benares has a singular 
atmosphere suitable for spiritual practices. Hindus believe that a bath in the 
Ganges River purifies them of sin, and causes them to rise to heaven at the time 
of death. We share no such belief but that does not stop us from enjoying 
meditation near the river bank, sometimes within smelling range of the 
cremation pyres. Surely that smell reminds us how precious every living 
moment is and how futile it is to fear death. 

Though my experience in Ananda Nagar has freed me from most of my 
doubts, I still hesitate to pass over the threshold into a new life. If only I could 
have met Baba. 

Two days later. Today was Dada Shivananda's culminating discourse. When 
he concluded his talk a wave rolled through us all, generating sighs, shouts, 
shivering and other occult symptoms. A thrill shook the heart region of my 
chest and left me awed. 

Afterward, the Margis dispersed—except one man who remained absorbed 
for several hours in deep meditation, indifferent to the brutally hot sun. 
Eventually another Margi held an umbrella over the man's head, but it was too 
late. After he came out of his trance the man suffGI" ed from sunstroke, though 
he didn't seem to care. 

A few minutes after the discourse, while I was still strongly feeling its 
effect, an unknown Dada approached me and asked, "Why have you come to 
India?" 

"I had two reasons. One was to meet Baba. So far that hasn't been possible. 
Second, after meeting Him I hoped to decide whether or not I should go for 
wholetimer training." 

"You could not do the first. Why not go ahead with the second and start the 
training?" He did not wait for my reply, and quietly walked

away. It was in this moment that I decided to at least visit the training center. 
Whether I will stay or not I don't know. 

Home 

Benares training center. As I passed through the doorway one thought and 
one thought alone grabbed me and echoed through my mind: "I am home! At 
last I've come home!" 

So it's fixed. From today my life's direction is clear. 

The training center is a three-room building near the hub of the city. In one 
room the thirty-five trainees study, eat and sleep. The second room is for group 
meditation and class. Living conditions are extremely cramped. Many of us 
also sleep in the meditation room and outside. For bedding, each person has a 
single blanket spread directly on the cement floor. A third small room is for the 
two trainers. The "kitchen" is outside: a mud oven and an area of beaten earth 
for cutting vegetables and rolling flat-breads. There is no running water. The 
well in the courtyard is used for drawing water for all purposes—cooking, 
cleaning, bathing and toilet functions. The toilets are deep-dug, i.e. without 
flush system: one outhouse for all the trainees, while the other inside the house 
is generally used only by the trainers. The courtyard is a mere twelve by nine 
meters. 

The sisters' training center is in some other section of Benares. One of our 
trainers visits them daily to give classes. 

Guidelines 

Today I was handed a list of the conducts rules that we must follow as 
monks, such as: 

* Practice meditation at least four times daily. One should not eat without 
having first done meditation. 

* Practice asanas twice daily. 

* Do not sleep on a soft bed. 

* Leave all sorts of luxuries. 

* Observe fasting at least four times every month. Fast without food or water 
from sunrise to sunrise on the prescribed days. 

* Do not consume meat, fish, eggs, onion, garlic, mushroom, caffeinated 
beverages such as tea and coffee, cocoa, alcohol, cigarettes or other 
intoxicants. 



67 


Travels with the. Mystic Master 


* Silence should be maintained at least thirty minutes daily. During this time 
one should not read, write or similarly divert the mind. 

* After completing the initial study of Ananda Marga philosophy, one should 
also try to study all other philosophies. 

* One should practice forgiveness and magnanimity of mind. 

* Keep aloof from criticizing, condemning or mudslinging. Avoid all sorts of 
groupism. Do not criticize any country. 

* Keep free from hatred, anger and vanity—including vanity of culture. 

* By becoming an ideal person, inspire others to become good. 

* Attract others by your sacrificing nature. 

* Try to remove the pain of others, and do not talk of your own trouble. 

* Accept all sufferings as rewards. 


...and literally hundreds more. Some of them are for all Margis, others only 
for renunciates. 

For me they are not rules but guidelines for gradually achieving a saintly 

life. 

A different training than expected 

Food is simple, but due to the cooking technique and lack of nutritional 
balance I am again thoroughly ill. The water is also surely unsuitable for me. 
Of course it doesn't help that this is the hottest time of the year. We are eating 
basically only disk-shaped flat breads, skinless beans, white rice, and green 
chilies which burn my mouth. The cooking duty changes daily among the 
trainees. Most of them are impatient with the large amount of work involved in 
preparation, so they usually make the flat breads very thick and do not cook 
them completely, and frequently undercook the beans also. Sometimes we re¬ 
ceive "drumsticks" in our food collection from generous though poor vegetable 
venders. They are called drumsticks because they are mostly fiber. They are 
usually cooked together with the beans. We chew them to get what we can out 
of them, then spit them out. Besides the occasional potatoes and eggplants, we 
do not see other vegetables, and never any fruits, except lemon water and one 
small banana per trainee the morning after fasting. Because we fast without 
food or water four days per month, we each receive four bananas per month. 

I am trying to overcome my continuous diarrhea by cleaning out my 
system. I'm staying away from rice and, on the suggestion of sev

eral Indian trainees, eating large amounts of chilies. But it just seems to get 
worse. 17 

When it rains we have to sleep on our sides because there is not enough 
space inside for all of us to sleep on our backs. 

I'm afraid that my poor health and the difficult living conditions are 
affecting my state of mind. I'm so wrapped up in my own personal problems 
that I'm unable to relate nicely to the other trainees. 

Our daily routine consists of meditation and kiirtan four times, yoga asanas 
twice, morning and afternoon classes, cooking and cleaning duties, and self- 
study. At present I am trying to memorize about 150 conduct rules, learn 
Prout 18 , memorize seventeen Sanskrit sayings which define the essence of 
Prout, and learn some basic Sanskrit and Bengali. This is proving difficult 
because my body is so weak that I'm usually oh the verge of sleep, and my 
knees are aching from sitting all day on the floor. There is only one chair in the 
classroom, and throughout the day a competition goes on to sit in it. I rarely 
win. 

Nose noise and tasty talks 

Last night I spoke to one of the trainers. 

"Dadaji, my nose has been heavily blocked with mucus for several days 
now. It's almost impossible for me to practice pranayama (alternate-nostril 
breathing meditation). What should I do?" 

"You say almost impossible?" 

"Yes." 

"That means it's possible. So you should continue the pranayama regularly. 
Rather, the pranayama that you've been doing twice daily should from now be 
increased to four times daily." 

Today I followed his directive. Not only does the pranayama take me much 
longer than anyone else, and cause my head to spin, but the sound of my nose 
is extremely loud, and disturbs the other trainees 

17 M uch later I came to know from Dadas that hot spices should be strictly avoided by the 
patient of diarrhea. The chilies were the worst thing I could have consumed. Of course they did 
succeed in cleaning me out—perhaps one or two thousand times. If I had eaten rice I might have 
been able to regain some sort of equilibrium. 18 Prout is an acronym which stands for the 
"Progressive Utilization Theory". Propounded by Baba in 1959, Prout is a system which 
provides for the rational development and distribution of all of society's material and mental 
resources. It is radically different from either capitalism or communism. See the appendix for 
an introduction to Prout.

during meditation. 1 am thus compelled to practice meditation in the adjacent 
room. 

My nose may remain blocked until I get out of here. The psychosocial gap 
separating me from the trainees has now been increased by a physical gap. 


During lunch we were served the usual drumsticks, indigestible beans and 
thick, partially cooked flat breads. I sighed and murmured, "Yuck. Again." 

"You think it's only tough for you." said the brother sitting next to me. "Do 
you imagine that this sort of food and life style is normal for the rest of us? In 
my family home we had thin delicate breads fried in purified butter every day, 
vegetable dishes of many tasty kinds, fruits, yoghurt, hot milk, and various 
milk sweets. You think you're so special." 

"No! I never said anything like that." 

But he had already turned away to talk with another person. 

A trainee makes trouble 

One of the Indian trainees, Santosh, is always happy and affectionate. 
Though most of the other brothers don't speak to me, he often does. He plays at 
reading the lines in our hands, and likes to discuss our personal lives. 
Nevertheless I don't like him much. 

This afternoon we were all performing group meditation when yelling and 
scuffling suddenly erupted from the corridor. I jumped up to see two trainees 
forcefully slapping Santosh, while one of the trainers looked on. Santosh was 
screaming in Hindi, "Please let me go! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" 

I was shocked. Running forward, I grabbed the two trainees and tried to 
push them away. 

The trainer touched me on the arm. 

"Please don't disturb now," he said. 

"But, how dare they? He's our brother!" I said. 

He pointed at an open suitcase on the floor, saying, "Do you recognize any 
of the papers there?" 

As the beating and yelling continued, I looked at the suitcase which was 
full of notebooks, letters, envelopes and crumpled papers of all 



Home 


70 


sorts. Suddenly I saw one crumpled envelope addressed to me. It was a letter 
from home which I had received, read and thrown away. I became even more 
confused and looked at the trainer. 

"Santosh is a spy from the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation)," he said. 
"Over the last few days he's made a nice collection of interesting documents, 
including several diaries stolen from my office desk. Fortunately we discovered 
the matter just as he was about to go out with the suitcase." 

"But he's a trainee, and wants to become an acharya. How could...?" 

"Things are not always as they seem to be." 

"Anyway what can the CBI gain from our documents?" 

"Nothing. We really have nothing to hide. But the CBI is aching to find 
something they can use to create trouble for us." 

The trainer catches my vibes 

Accompanied by an Indian trainee, I went to the market area to change 
some of my travelers' checks into rupees so I could make a donation to the 
training center. It was understood that I wouldn't spend any of the money 
except for the cost of the rickshaw. But when we passed a fruit stall we could 
not restrain ourselves from enjoying a few bananas. Though most people would 
consider this of no consequence, for me it was tantamount to stealing, and I 
immediately felt guilty. 

When we returned to the center the trainees were eating lunch, the usual 
tasteless gook. Looking at their pitiful condition, I felt sheepish, to say the 
least. I submitted the account to one of the trainers, Dada N, and covered up the 
expense for the bananas. After that I felt so glum that I could not join the meal, 
and walked around the building in a tortured state of mind for half an hour. 

Finally I couldn't take it any longer. I knocked at the door of the trainer 
who had not come out since I spoke to him. 

"Yes. Come in." 

"Sir, I'm sorry. Very sorry." 

"What is it, my boy?" 

"I have a mistake to admit, and I want to ask for punishment." "Bananas, 

huh?" "What! How could...?'' 

He only looked at me calmly, with a tinge of a smile. 



71 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Anyway, Dadaji, I feel very bad." I half-heartedly added, "Can you please 
give me punishment?" I expected him to direct me to fast or something similar. 

"I think you've had enough punishment already during the last half hour. 
Better that you just return to your studies." 

Going out, I wondered how the trainer could know. I asked the other 
trainee if he had mentioned our indulgence to anyone. 

"Of course not," he answered nonchalantly. "You think I'm an idiot?" 

What for? 

The same trainer called me into his office today. "Sit 

down, my boy." 

I sat on a chair facing him. With his eyes half closed, he entered a semi¬ 
trance condition, pointed his two index fingers at me, and began rotating them 
in small circles. I felt a bit uncomfortable. 

"There's some problem with your knees, isn't it?" he said in a distant voice. 
I nodded. 

"Perhaps you had an accident or major operation on them when you were 
young?" He must have been seeing the colored auras around my knees since I 
was wearing pants as always. 

"Yes. When I was sixteen years old a crazy doctor operated on my knees 
declaring that he would correct my bow-leggedness." 

"Ah," he said softly. "You see." He became silent. I felt even more 
uncomfortable. 

"Alright, you can go now." 

I've never liked the blatant exhibition of occult power. There's nothing 
miraculous in it, and usually it is misused merely to impress oth- 


19 In 1974. I received a letter from a friend in India mentioning that this Dada left his 
acharyaship. My friend wrote: "I was shocked, considering that Dada N wrote the first two 
comprehensive books on Prout, and appeared so highly developed. But several workers told me 
that Dada N'sloss of confidence was surely a direct result of the misutilization of his personally 
gained powers. He remains a Margi, and intends to marry. It's a pity. Though I respect the 
family path as spiritually equal to the way of the ren undate, for Dada N it is clearly unsuitable. 

I wonder if he may remain in confusion for many years to come."

Going down 

No word short of emaciated can describe my physical condition. I have 
nothing to hang onto except my bone-dry determination to follow my spiritual 
path and become an acharya. Meditation is extremely difficult; my mind 
wanders incessantly. What occupies my mind more during meditation—my 
spiritual ideal or the thought of ice cream-choco-late-crunchy granola cereal- 
peanut butter-fresh fruits-milk shake-a swim in the sea-a clean quiet room-and a 
soft bed? Though I try not to think of such things, they bombard me whenever I 
close my eyes. 

I've never been so thoroughly depressed in my entire life. The diarrhea has 
become amoebic dysentery, my eyes have turned yellow due to hepatitis, and 
my nose is continuously blocked. The severe pain in my belly does not allow 
me to stand up straight or walk properly. Everyone else gets up at 4:30 each 
morning, but I get up at 3:30 to use the outhouse. This sometimes takes the full 
hour, and the effort leaves me soaked in perspiration. I've totally lost my sense 
of humor and as a result all the Indian trainees dislike me. There are only three 
other Westerners here—two Americans and one German. They are also sick, 
but not as bad as I. They are able to relate to the Indians to some extent, but I 
talk only to them. By and large, the Indian trainees believe that I am faking 
much of my sickness, so they are unsympathetic. The trainers, however, are 
concerned and send me to different doctors from time to time. None of the 
medicine helps. 

Though I frequently fall asleep while studying, somehow I've learned 
enough of the course material to pass most of the tests of the first half of our 
syllabus. Among all the trainees, my knowledge of Sanskrit was the worst. 
Oddly enough, I was the only one to pass the Sanskrit exam this time. On the 
other hand, I thought that my understanding of Prout was better than anyone 
else's, yet I was the only one to fail the Prout exam. The examiner, who visits 
once monthly, is a very senior Dada named Acharya Dasaratha. Obviously, he 
considers more than mere intellectual knowledge. 

The second part of my training has begun. I have to learn the spiri-tual 
philosophy in depth, including the principles of many other ma

jor spiritual and religious orders of the world, memorize and be able to explain 
the meaning of about 100 Sanskrit shlokas (aphorisms) related to Ananda 
Marga spiritual philosophy, memorize by sound only about 400 other Sanskrit 
shlokas, and be able to demonstrate and explain all the important yoga postures. 
The most difficult part is the 400 Sanskrit shlokas because I have no idea of 
their meaning, and will surely find it perfectly boring. 20 

An Indian brother, Amitabha, is in charge of shopping and running errands 
in the city. Twice he's accompanied me to see doctors. This morning, I was 
leaning against the well, waiting for someone to draw water for me, when 
Amitabha approached me with a worried look. 

"You're very sick, brother," he said. 

"What's new in that?" I said. 

"I thought you were faking it. But last night it was raining so I had to sleep 
near the latrine. Baba, I think you stepped on me or over me fifteen or twenty 
times rushing to pass stool. Come on, you better lie down and I'll bring another 
doctor." 

"Doctors are useless. Besides, my nightly visits to the latrine have been 
going on for a long time. You simply didn't know about it. I told you and 
everyone else that my system's broken, but no one believed me." 

A crucial lesson 

Today will surely prove a red-letter day in my personal history. 

Just before the morning class started, I was still in bed, completely 
depressed. On his way to class, the trainer, Dada Japananda, stopped to talk to 
me. 

"I think you are very ill this morning, no?" 

"Yeah," I moaned. 

"Is it impossible for you to attend class?" "Yeah." 

"Then don't worry. Rest now, and we will arrange the doctor later." In fact, 
with a bit of pain I could have gotten up and joined the class. So it was a lie. I 
simply didn't want to do anything. 

20 Soon after I completed my training, the number of shlokas that had to be memorized by 
Westerners was sharply decreased, and translations were added.

At the same time I felt guilty for not getting up. So I pulled myself near the 
classroom door. Lying on my stomach, unable to see into the room, I listened. 

"You there," the trainer said apparently to one of the brothers in the class. 
"Stand up. Tell what Sanskrit shloka you memorized since yesterday." 

"I'm sorry, sir. I did not leam any new shloka. " "What? Nonsense. Sit down. 
You." he said to another trainee, "stand up. What shloka did you learn since 
yesterday." "I'm sorry, sir. I also." 

"Stupid. Lazy fellow. Sit down. What about you?" he said to a third trainee. 

"I'm sorry, sir." 

"What is this! Are you all simply killing the time here? Anyone who 
learned any shloka since yesterday stand up now." 

Silence. Tension-filled, fear-laden silence. Surely no one stood up. Ten 
seconds passed. I leaned nearer the door, straining to catch what was 
happening. 

Suddenly a huge banging sound startled and shocked me. Goose pimples 
rose in my skin. It was the fist of the trainer, which he had pounded a single 
time with great force on the classroom table. 

"You worthless bloodsuckers! Worse than animals! At least animals make 
no claim to serving others. But you. you hypocrites, you pretend to have 
dedicated your lives to serving mankind! Bah! You rest nicely in this house, 
passing the time comfortably day by day, while your spiritual father lies 
suffering in a prison cell without even a fan or any other sort of normal 
comfort! While He undergoes penance to demonstrate the ideal sacrifice for 
society, you all couldn't care less, bound up in your personal likes and dislikes! 
Hypocrites, parasites! I'll have nothing to do with any of you. I won't see your 
faces unless and until you change your ways!" 

He stomped out of the classroom without noticing me still lying near 
the door. 

I stood up immediately. 

I have no right to be depressed, now or ever, I thought. How can I serve 
anyone, how can I expand myself, how can I do anything of any value if I am 
sad? From this moment I shall never again indulge in sorrow.

I picked up my towel and walked in an almost normal gait to the well. For 
the first time since my troubles began I did not care about the pain in my 
stomach. Ignoring my weakness, I pulled up a bucket of water—something 
which over the last few weeks I had believed I couldn't do. 21 

A beggar's life 

Because of my positive mental outlook, my health has improved greatly. 
Though I still suffer from dysentery and hepatitis, most of the pain in my 
stomach is gone, and I can stand up comfortably. My sense of humor.hasn't 
fully returned, but at least I'm able to be pleasant with the other trainees. 

Until now I couldn't do one part of the training due to my ill health: SPT 22 . 
The trainers were afraid I would collapse if I did. My feeling, however, was 
that the training would strengthen rather than weaken me. I argued again and 
again that merely pacing up and down our little courtyard was not enough for 
me. Yesterday they reluctantly consented, and today my SPT began. 

I now use only two large pieces of white cotton for clothing. One I tie on 
like a loose skirt. The other piece, draped around my upper body, doubles as a 
bag for collecting vegetables whenever I go out begging. Deprived of soap, 
comb, toothbrush and paste, I use ash, dirt and water to clean my body, and 
twigs from the neem tree to clean my teeth. Perhaps the greatest difficulty is 
the lack of shoes or sandals, because the road is blistering hot. 

Each morning I go from door to door, begging for vegetables and flour. I 
utter only four words: H ari aum tat sat, meaning "The original cosmic Word of 
God is That unchanging Truth". I may speak these 

21 Since that day, I have never known depression for more than a few minutes at a time. 

I attribute this to the simple determination not to accept sorrow, combined with vari¬ 
ous Tantric practices which strengthen the mind. Of these practices, the most impor¬ 
tant is kiirtan. On the other hand, the devotional sorrow that one may feel in relation 
to God or guru can be a good thing. 

22 Sadhana piitha training. Sadhana means spiritual effort, and piitha means a point 
which is spiritually charged (like the special meditation spots in Ananda Nagar). SPT 
is an exercise in poverty, silence and begging which each trainee undergoes for at least 
one week. The temporary identification with the poorest of the poor is in itself said to 
bean illuminating power point for spiritual realization.

words three times to any person. If someone should repeatedly insist that I 
provide a justification, I may explain. But after that I may not accept any 
donation from him. Generally, two hours of begging is sufficient. From the 
money I receive, I buy a small clay cooking pot and a bit of cow dung for fuel. 
Whatever remains is turned over to the trainers. I cook only those foodstuffs 
which are directly donated. 

Though the experience is difficult, I don't care; I am pleased that I am 
finally allowed to do it. 

A week later. Today was my final day of SPT. While taking off and burning 
my beggar's dress, one thought pounded over and over in my brain: I must not 
forget the difficulties of our brothers and sisters who live like this. The work for 
society's upliftment is meaningless unless those who are lowest rise up. 

Besides this. I'm more confident now of being able to accept any difficulties 
I may undergo in the future due to human-made or natural catastrophes. 
Ironically, the exercise was exactly what my body needed. My diseases go on, 
but the walking has given me energy which I lacked the last two months. 
Because of the silence and simple life style, meditation is also stronger. 

One strange element: though all SPT trainees complain that the streets burn 
their feet, I didn't feel the slightest trouble. 

I remember the incident of one brother who said to our guru, "Baba, I am 
weak. Please give me more power so that I may better do Your work." 

Baba replied, "There's no need to ask. First use up whatever power you've 
got. Then you can be sure the Supreme Consciousness will grant you more. And 
when your tractor is so broken it can no longer be refueled. He will give you a 
new tractor." 

The force of sweetness 

It was announced today that the four westerners plus a few other trainees 
will soon commence "field training". We will leave the training center for about 
one week. Each of us will travel to a different city to hold lectures and meetings 
on meditation and yoga for the general public. 

When I heard the news, the first thought to pop in my mind was. Finally, a 
chance to get some sweets! Though I know I should not think 



77 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


of such things, the idea of sweets keeps coming and coming. Truthfully, I'm not 
really trying to control my mind, because I enjoy thinking of the sweets. I 
wonder if such crude thinking is common for people undergoing intense yogic 
training. 

My field training is in Mokamo, a city of about 100,000 people. It is a half¬ 
day's train ride from Benares. Ananda Marga has a large group of active 
members here. 

When I arrived at the station, I was met by the local Ananda Marga leader. 
His name is Madhusudan, which is an ancient name of Lord Krishna. Everyone 
calls him "Madhu" for short, which means "sweet" or "honey". I found this an 
intriguing coincidence, considering my intense longing for sweets. 

Before starting a tight schedule of lectures, Madhu wanted to introduce me 
to some of the leading Margis in the city. First he took me to the house of a 
high school teacher. As soon as we entered, the man jumped up and said, "I 
shan't be a minute. Take rest please, and I'll be right back." 

When he returned he was holding a small cardboard box, which he placed 
on the table in front of me. "Open it," he said, "and please enjoy the contents." 

The box was full of burfi— expensive milk-sweets! I was so excited. 
Pretending to be calm, I first offered the sweets to the teacher and to Madhu. 
Madhu said, "Oh, no no no. These are just for you." He added in a soft voice so 
that the teacher would not hear him, "And it is better that you eat them all, 
otherwise he may be offended." I nodded, maintaining my composure, but I 
was internally thrilled and delighted. Within five minutes I finished the box— 
about a half kilogram. 

After some short discussion, Madhu and I left for the house of another 
Margi, a police officer. When he saw us, he also stood up and asked us to wait 
a moment for him. Like the teacher, he returned with a cardboard box and 
opened it for me. It contained gulab jaman— slightly different but equally rich 
milk sweets. "Am I dreaming?" I thought. Again they refused to accept any for 
themselves, and I was compelled to eat everything. Now I felt totally satisfied. 

We went to another Margi's house and the same sequence of events! 
Another half kilogram of milk sweets. Too much! But again their cus

tom forced me to finish it. "Baba, what are you doing to me?" Now I felt a bit 
ill, with a heavy stomach and a hyped-up, sugar-stimulated nervous system. 

We went to another Margi's house where I was offered my fourth box of 
milk sweets. 

"I can't possibly eat it," I whispered to Madhu. 

"But you must." he hissed. "Don't cause any embarrassment." Strange how 
biting his tone seemed to be. almost heartless, as if he knew that I had been 
improperly desiring these sweets, and now must pay the price. But I hadn't 
mentioned these thoughts to anyone. 

Slowly I forced myself to eat those sweets also. I felt like vomiting. 

After this visit, he insisted we go to another house, but I refused point- 
blank. 

In the future, I must try to avoid concentrating on any crude desires. It 
seems that meditation causes their manifestation. 

Logic beyond logic 

The field training keeps me hectically busy, and I love it. The internal 
energy built up in Benares is finding its expression. Usually I give three or four 
lectures daily for different schools, clubs, and civic organizations. It seems like 
everyone in the city knows that I'm here, and they all want to see the westerner 
who teaches yoga. I'm not yet authorized to teach personalized meditation 
techniques, but I've been teaching the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra to crowds of 
up to 2000 people at a time. 

I usually have very little advance notice of whom I'll be speaking to, nor do 
I prepare my lectures. My talks are all spontaneous. Because some people 
attend more than one program, 1 also make sure each talk is unique. 

Today I was brought to the main university. Before giving the lecture, the 
organizers ushered me into a meeting room in which there were about forty 
professors. 

"Who's the audience this time, Madhu?" 1 asked. 

"You will be speaking to the combined faculty and students of three 
departments: logic, ethics and metaphysics." 

"I see." At that time I was in such a flow that my intellect was barely 
functioning. I was slightly baffled trying to understand the meaning of 



79 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


each of these three words. 'Logic' was okay, 'ethics' was half clear, but 
'metaphysics' left me in a cloud. 

I turned to converse with the professor sitting next to me. After a few 
minutes, I nonchalantly came to my real point. 

"You know in the west," I said, "many words carry different meaning than 
in India. Here at this university, what do you mean by the word ’metaphysics'?" 

I grasped little of his complicated reply. But at least I memorized his words 
"those dimensions that transcend purely physical analysis." 

"Dadaji," another professor inteijected, "all of us would like to know the 
title of your discourse today." His voice was loud enough that everyone 
suddenly stopped their personal conversations to listen to my reply. 

Without thinking, I said, "I will talk on 'The Absolute and Eternal 
Relationship between Logic, Ethics and Metaphysics'." 

There was a gasp of many voices throughout the room. 

"No one has ever spoken on such a topic here, Dadaji. It should be 
extremely interesting." 

Now I was occupied trying to deduce the meaning of my title. But before I 
could figure out even the slightest connection, the door opened, and one man 
announced, "Gentlemen, let us proceed to the lecture hall." 

The organizers brought me onto a stage. I faced about 500 students and 
teachers. One man spent five minutes lauding praises on me. During that time I 
tried to divine something of my subject, but could only draw a blank. 

Then it was my turn to speak. From the moment I started, I had no idea 
what I was saying. The words I used were complex, and the sentence structures 
and relations between those sentences were even more complex. I was totally 
lost, but went on speaking enthusiastically. Several times the audience 
interrupted me with applause, though I didn't know what they were 
appreciating. At the end, they gave me a long and loud standing ovation. 

The main organizer told the audience, "When Dadaji first told the title of 
his lecture, many of us wondered what he would speak. I dare say that we are 
now fully satisfied with his explanation. Nevertheless, you are now welcome to 
ask questions."

One student stood up and asked something. God knows what he asked; it 
was far beyond my understanding. 

"Instead of replying," I said, "what would you think if here and now I were 
to teach you all something which will answer all the questions you have related 
to this topic?" 

Everyone applauded. I taught them B aba Nam K evalam meditation. 

Then I escaped. 

Accelerating zeal 

Benares training center. Each time we have group meditation, a different 
trainee leads it. Today was Vimal's turn. He's a very simple fellow, which, in his 
case, carries two meanings. On one side he's devotional and affectionate, but on 
the other hand he often falls into trouble. Once, when Baba was passing on a 
road, Vimal threw himself in full prostration at Baba's feet. Normally this might 
be an understandably humble or even spiritual act. But as rain had only just let 
up, Vimal rose to his feet covered with mud. While Baba pretended not to 
notice, Vimal's face was illumined with a broad smile. 

Today while leading the kiirtan, he gradually became more and more 
enthusiastic, jumping higher and wider, and thrusting his arms toward Baba's 
photo. As he sang Sam'gacchadvam before meditation, he accented each word 
with heartfelt emotion. During the silent meditation, he was not so silent, 
uncontrollably blurting out "ah!" and "oh!" and "Baba!" with such explosive 
force that no one could help but be amused. Afterward, he could barely get 
through the singing of the G uru Puja, breaking into tears repeatedly. 

At last came the point for him to lead us in the Supreme Command. 23 His 
emotions were so strong that he could not stop himself from leaping up, lifting 
his fist high in the air, and shouting with full fanaticism, "THE SUPREME 
COMMAND!" With these words, he 

23 a) The ancient Sanskrit verse, sam ‘gacchadvam', is sung before group meditation. It comes 
from the Rk Veda, composed about 15,000 years ago, and means—Let us move together, let us 
sing together, let us come to know our minds together, let us share like sages of the past, uniting 
ourselves in intention and mind, b) Guru Puja. performed after meditation, is more than a 
song—it is a spiritual practice by which one offers one's strongest attachment or ego to the 
infinite Entity, and ultimately offers oneself, c) The Supreme Command was written by Baba. It 
contains the most essential guidelines for a spiritual life.

collapsed on his back, falling upon some of us. Of course, we burst into 
laughter. But he did not hear our response. His eyes were closed, and he 
remained in super-consciousness (samadhi) for about two hours. Devotees 
each have their own unique way. 

Passing by chance 

Over the last weeks, my health has again crumbled, to the point that I can 
barely walk. But I never complain, and I accept the troubles as a help to 
solidify and increase my realization. Still it's hard for me to joke—my mind 
needs much more expansion. 

Studying is a tiring task. The 400 meaningless shlokas are the worst part. 
Ten days ago I passed both the Prout and spiritual philosophy examinations, 
but have yet to fully memorize the shlokas. Every time I look at them, my head 
spins. Sometimes I think I forget more than I remember. 

Difficult as it is, the studying has its own merit—to discipline the mind 
even while feeling exhaustion and discomfort. 


October. I really have no idea how I managed, but by cramming and by the 
Lord's grace I learned enough shlokas to pass the exam. There were many I 
didn't know, but by "chance" the examiner quizzed me mostly on the shlokas I 
had learned. Of course I will soon forget them, but it doesn't matter—my 
concentration has been improved radically by the exercise. 

The second phase of my training is completed. I will go to Patna for the 
third phase. Perhaps it's just in time—for my health. 

Pandemonium with a purpose 

Though Ananda Marga's permanent global office is in Ananda Nagar, the 
global camp office is presently in Patna—it is here that Baba lies in a poorly 
ventilated, inferior jail cell. Patna is a half-day's bus ride away from the Nepal 
border. It is an ordinary congested Indian city filled with poverty, filth, and 
hidden mysticism. 

How can I describe our global office? It is certainly not like the stereotyped 
image of a yoga school or spiritual center—beautiful, calm, immaculately 
clean, organized, disciplined class programs, healthy food

shared collectively, everything moving according to fixed schedule, and a staff 
who reflect only profound inner peace. Rather, at first glance it appears to be 
the direct opposite. The three-story concrete building is overflowing with paper 
work, maintained in shabby, irregular files. Old office equipment in various 
stages of disrepair occupy much of what would otherwise be our living space. 
Scores of Dadas and Didis dressed in every shade of orange scurry about, 
struggling to fulfill unannounced, urgent social work targets. They say the 
number of workers increases to four or five hundred at the time of their 
monthly meetings—somehow everyone adjusts. In every room, nay. in every 
comer, different schedules are followed—many work throughout the night and 
get little, if any, sleep. Irregularity of meals due to the pressure of work is the 
norm rather than the exception—a common example of a hurried meal is 
peanuts, puffed rice and a banana. 

Yet there is something wonderful here! One hears conversations and sees 
documents concerned with medical clinics, cheap kitchens, disaster relief, 
philosophical publications, cultural clubs, poor students' book cooperatives, 
anti-exploitation movements. At any moment, in the midst of the apparent 
chaos, there is someone singing devotional songs, and someone else sunk in 
deep meditation. In between the pa-per work they practice their yoga postures. 
Their enthusiasm, their laughter, their disagreements, their unperturbed 
concentration amid constant distractions—it all clearly demonstrates the 
Tantric spirit, the zeal to fight against any difficulty for the upliftment of self 
and society. Who can enjoy this? Somehow I do. 

Here is where I'll finish training. I arrived today with another trainee who 
passed the second phase with me, a German named Praveda. 

Our trainer is a highly elevated Dada. Some say he naturally exudes power 
to those who sit in meditation with him. Recently he completed a 40-day 
protest fast which was the first of its kind in Ananda Marga. A demonstration 
against the injustice of Baba's incarceration, it gained widespread newspaper 
coverage, if nothing else. 

Our coursework consists of copying and memorizing various notebooks 
concerned with our spiritual and organizational functions. The trainer will also 
give us regular classes. 

Living conditions are slightly better than Benares. We two westerners are 
staying in an Ananda Marga students' hostel 500 meters

Travels with the Mystic Master 


away from the global office, and living space is sufficient. We receive a small 
weekly allowance with which we purchase and prepare our meals. I guess I'll 
be able to save money while still eating in a way which for me now seems 
luxurious. Today, for example, we breakfasted on tomatoes, puffed rice and 
yoghurt. I can't help but feel it seems God-sent. 

Invisible devotees 

New Delhi. I am here to extend my Indian visa, and then I'll go back to 
Patna. Ravindra and Sadhana, a devoted Margi couple, have invited me to stay 
in their house during my stay in Delhi. Ravindra is the head care-taker of the 
Delhi Zoo, so their house is in a quiet area near the Zoo. 

Today I was alone in the house. While meditating in the small room which 
they keep solely for that purpose, I heard people singing kiirtan: Baba nam 
kevalam. 

"What is this?" I thought. "Some other Margis have come?" 

I broke my meditation, stood up, and walked out of the room in the 
direction of the kiirtan. But after taking a few steps outside the room I couldn't 
hear the kiirtan anymore. I went outside the house. Only birds were singing. 

"Strange," I thought, and went back to resume my meditation. When I sat 
down, immediately my mind became concentrated. 

A few minutes later I again heard people singing kiirtan. 

"Maybe some Margis are playing a trick on me," I thought. "But this time 
I'll catch them!" I jumped up and ran toward the singing. But once more, the 
voices disappeared without a trace. Everything was perfectly peaceful. 

Scratching my head, I went back to meditate. After a short while, the 
kiirtan appeared again. 

"It must be inside my head," I thought. Partially ignoring the kiirtan, and 
partially enjoying it, I went on with my meditation. The kiirtan also continued. 
Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes later I noticed it was no longer there. 

A couple hours later, Ravindra and Sadhana came home. 

"Were you comfortable in our house when we weren't here?" asked 
Sadhana. 



Home 


84 


"Yes," I said. "But I had a peculiar experience in your meditation room. I 
heard people singing kiirtan again and again, but nobody was there." 

The two of them immediately started laughing. 

"It's a common experience in that room," Ravindra said. "When our 
meditation is deep, we often hear that kiirtan. A few other Margis have heard it 
too." 

"Well then, at least it's nothing to worry about," I said. "Do you know the 
explanation?" 

"Invisible devotees, I suppose," said Sadhana. 

Though we all laughed, I felt her idea was not far from the truth. 

Baba exposes my secret 

Patna. A Filipino Dada who was held in the same jail as Baba for the last 
nine months was released today. 

He was standing in the comer of a large courtyard surrounded by several 
other workers and Margis. When he saw me approaching, he said, "You must 
be Dharmapala." 

I was surprised because we had never met. 

"How do you know me?" I asked. 

"Oh, Baba spoke of you many times." 

I became even more surprised. 

"What did He say?" 

"He said that it was good to see some nice American boys like you 
becoming acharya." 

"And did He say anything negative about me?" 

"Well...once when He was talking about you, He said, 'Unfortunately, that 
boy never does his asanas 24 in the evening time.'" 

I was shocked. Though I accept that Baba is omniscient, I never expected 
He would notice and expose such mundane things about me even when I was 
not present. And I am sure absolutely no one could have noticed I was not 
doing my asanas because I always shift from room to room during the evening 
since coming to Patna. 

I'll never miss my asanas again, except when it is impossible to do them. 


2i Asanas are physical yoga postures which purify the body, and to some extent also the mind, 
by harmonizing the glands, hormonal secretions, blood circulation and nerves.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Apparent injustice 

Over the last several days my trainer has been complaining to Praveda and 
me that his greatness is misunderstood by others, and that many Dadas are 
jealous of his spiritual accomplishments. It's true that his behavior is apparently 
eccentric: suddenly inducing high states of meditation in some of the foreigners 
who sit near him, frequently secluding himself alone for many hours in a 
locked room, eating vast amounts of food, and being so moody that he changes 
his plans every day. He often denies us classes due to "mistakes" which we 
never committed. Nevertheless I believe he is highly elevated, and that each of 
his strange actions have some underlying benevolent hidden purpose. 

The attack by the other Dadas has now gone to an extreme. They have long 
been requesting him to move away from the foreigners' quarters, and stay in the 
main central office, but he has always refused. Today two workers picked up 
all his belongings, and transferred them to a room in the central office. He was 
adamant that he would not shift, and remained in his room which was empty of 
everything except the blanket on which he sat. 

A few hours later they also physically carried him away. 

I'm astonished at this injustice! 

A decisive meeting 

We have been regularly visiting our trainer in his new room. He 
continuously talks about the wrongs being done to him, how immature the 
other workers are, and how much they have yet to grow in their spiritual 
insight. Of course, I agree with him. 

Tonight I heard that a small committee was discussing what punishment he 
should be given. I could not believe it and became angry when others told me it 
was suspected he has indulged in conduct which was wrong for an acharya. I 
felt it my duty to vouch for his innocence. The committee meeting was on the 
top floor of the four-story building. I ran up, anxious to arrive before it was too 
late. Panting, and after barely knocking, I opened the door. Another shock. 
Instead of three or four persons sitting there, about 50 or 60 orange-clothed 
Dadas turned their faces toward me. They were also surprised at my intrusion. 

"Excuse me...ah, you're having a meeting..." 



Home 


86 


"Yes, of course it's a meeting," the gray-haired Dada standing in front said, 
gently smiling. "What do you like to say?" 

"Ah...well...pardon me but I heard you were discussing the matter of my 
trainer." 

Laughter came from all sides of the room. I was frustrated and felt even 
more angry. How dare they take my trainer's case as a joke? 

"Go ahead," the elderly Dada said, also chuckling, "and speak your mind." 

Determined to make my point. I blurted out, "I have been with him hours 
every day, and I am sure that these charges are all wrong. His character is pure 
and blemishless, and he couldn't make such a mistake." 

The Dadas exploded with laughter. Some even rolled on the ground, 
laughing so hard. I was utterly confused by their response. 

"Thank you very much," said the grinning elderly Dada. "We will keep your 
opinion in mind." The laughter increased, and I walked out of the room, more 
frustrated than ever. 

An hour later all the workers came downstairs. One of them with whom I 
am close, came to me and said. "Brother, we were not talking about your 
trainer. That was a general finance meeting." 

Danger of the third stage 

Two days later. In the early hours of the morning, while everyone was 
sleeping, my trainer left. No one knows where he's gone, or at least no one says. 

Ten days later. What a naive fool I've been. Today it was confirmed: three 
days ago my trainer left India. While departing, he announced his intention to 
get married. It seems that he's been planning this move for a long time, having 
already arranged his passport and visa. 

The Dada who had tried the most to help him commented to me, "Many 
times I told him not to engage in self-aggrandizement. He had such a bloated 
ego—he thought he knew more than anyone. In Tantra, such people either see 
their mistake, or they make even bigger blunders. For a short time he'll be sky- 
high happy. But when he comes down on his feet again, he'll feel he cheated 
himself. He won't be content unless he does full-steam meditation and social 
service. That sort of

lifestyle is a full-time commitment. It can't be adjusted with a family. His only 
path is to be a monk." 25 


(Author's afternote: Many persons come and go on the spiritual path. Even 
after a few years of effort some Margis may give up their 

25 The fact that a senior Dada engaged in deception and violated his vows is no cause for 
doubting spiritual ideology. The way of Tantra is sometimes very difficult. The path cuts deeply 
through narrow-mindedness and selfishness. While self-realization and strength to serve the 
society grow ever greater, the consequences of making mistakes also grows. To continue moving 
past countless temptations and also past all one's inevitable mistakes, the only saving grace is 
found in the humility cultured by devotion or love for Guru. That humility does not allow 
superiority or inferiority feelings to develop. By thinking T know myself. I shall never fall from 
my path', aspirants fool themselves. They are in great danger because they depend upon ego. 
Whereas those who think—I know nothing, I only want to do what Guru or God wants me to 
do—they rise higher and higher after getting up from each fall. But these humble ones do not 
know they are higher. They know nothing. 

The Tantric organization provides the structure for everyone to try their best, and allows 
aspirants to err again and again if they are willing to admit their mistakes and try to rectify 
themselves. 

My trainer had entered the "third stage" of spiritual development at the time of his 
downfall. In the first stage one feels difficulty to concentrate, and also may be challenged by his 
or her family or friends. In the second stage, some concentration is achieved, and a little bit of 
bliss is experienced. Obstacles are more internal than external. In the third stage, one-pointed 
concentration enables the aspirant to achieve some occult power, but the mind is not yet merged 
in the infinite entity. I quote one of Baba's writings: 

"There is quick progress, no doubt, in this third stage, but there are strong possibilities of 
degradation also. At every step one must move with vigilance. In this stage the spiritual 
aspirants acquire some occult powers, but these powers may be dangerous after a certain 
progress. There is every chance of misuse or abuse of those occult powers as a result of which 
onedegenerates.... The spiritual path is as sharp as the razor's edge, it is really inaccessible' —so 
say the realized persons. Human beings will have to move on, but in this stage they cannot move 
a step forward unless and until they develop a high-grade conscience. For this they depend 
solely on the grace of the Supreme.... In this third stage, if there is devotion, one can easily move 
forward without any difficulty: but a person who has no devotion, whose heart is as dry as a 
desert, will find it impossible to progress." 

I n the fourth stage one's mind becomes inextricably concentrated upon the Supreme Being. 
Then all psychic problems cease, and only external difficulties confront the aspirant. But there is 
no possibility of downfall because the thought of Guru is constantly present. Baba writes about 
this stage: "When a person attains an exalted state of spirituality, he or she can bring welfare to 
millions of people, and they can do so due to the grace of the Supreme C onsciousness."

spiritual practices. They may continue to accept Ananda Marga as an excellent 
way. but they do not have the strength to continue. What is the cause? Some 
believe our most important practice is meditation. Others think it is service. Still 
others think that the key lies in the balance between these two. And there are 
others who say that the only guarantee lies in following all the disciplines, 
though I do not know anyone who does that. 

I noticed one vital point among the acharyas who gave up their 
acharyaship, and among the Margis who stopped practicing meditation—they 
all had one thing in common: they did not regularly practice kiirtan when they 
were alone. By meditation or by social work one may develop the ego of 
accomplishment or of failure. Whereas kiirtan, the singing and dancing to Baba 
nam kevalam, is free of egoistic ambition. It is a purely devotional practice. It is 
a dance of surrender to Guru and God. 

My trainer hardly ever sang kiirtan. He used to say, "Only those who are 
weak-minded need kiirtan. My meditation is very powerful, so I don't require 
such singing." 

But Baba says otherwise: "The nucleus of devotion is not to be found in the 
heart of the dry yogi. Rather it is located in the hearts of those who are 
practicing kiirtan. If you want to develop devotion, when you have 30 minutes 
time for spiritual practices, spend 20 minutes in kiirtan, and 10 minutes in 
meditation." 

Some say, "It's alright to do kiirtan. But it should be natural and unforced. I 
do it whenever I feel like it." I think that is a mistake. Kiirtan is the means to 
receive inspiration. So it is most beneficial to perform especially when one is 
depressed or otherwise not inspired. Silent meditation is a hundred times more 
valuable if it is begun with a clear and happy mind. That's why kiirtan is a must 
before meditation, unless the environment does not permit it. If, after doing 
kiirtan for 10 minutes, you still do not feel uplifted, continue it. It may take 20 
minutes, or even 30 minutes. But eventually it works because it reminds oneself 
again and again: there's nothing to worry about—everything is only the 
expression of cosmic love.]

and Hocus-Pocus 


Changing into something more comfortable 

Patna. 1973. At last, my training is finished! That which was said to be 
impossible without meeting Baba finally happened: I've become an acharya. Of 
course simultaneous with being pleased at proving the impossible to be 
possible, I still carry in my breast the unfulfilled wish to be with Him 
physically. Well, never mind—the omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent Guru 
is in my heart. I don't need to meet Him. Anyway, my feet have been itching to 
get on the road where I can get into some real service and spiritual adventures. 

And where will that be? The answer also came today: Australia. Officially 
I'm already the "Melbourne Regional Secretary". It comes as a bit of a surprise; 
I imagined my posting would be in Africa or Asia. But that's fine with me. 
Anywhere will be a relief from this training which overtaxed my patience. It 
will simply be a different sort of challenge than I expected. 

I should add that replacing my civilian clothes with an orange turban, and 
orange and white robes has given me inexpressible satisfaction. My robes 
automatically awaken within me a dynamic spiritual mood. They feel so 
natural. In comparison, my civilian clothes feel like a stage-costume, worn only 
to play a role in the "normal" social drama. 

This uniform also serves as a symbol, which will constantly remind me to 
try to serve others spiritually and socially. At the same time it announces to 
others: Here is someone who wants to serve you. 26 

“The orange color represents fire: the fire of sacrifice. 




The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 90 


Baba promises His support 

Today Dada Ramananda, Baba's personal assistant, told me a beautiful 
story. It happened about two years ago, before Baba was in jail. At that time, 
hundreds of thousands of people were suffering from floods. Baba sent 
Ramanandaji to serve the people. Dada had no resources, so he appealed to the 
Margis for support. They made a team which provided daily food for about 500 
people. He felt those benefited were like a small drop in the ocean of suffering, 
and so he constantly worried about how to increase his service. 

After a few days, a big spiritual function was held by Baba. Ramanandaji 
did not want to leave the suffering people, so he was the only Dada who did not 
attend. Baba sent someone to fetch Dada. He also informed His assistant, 
"Whenever Ramanandaji arrives, even if it is in the midnight, he must 
immediately come to me." 

When Ramanandaji came to the function, he was told to go to Baba's room. 
He was nervous that Baba would be angry and punish him due to so little 
service. 

On entering the room. Dada found Baba pacing back and forth. Baba spoke 
to him using a strict tone, "Don't disturb me right now. You sit in the corner." 
So Ramanandaji was put on his guard for an unpleasant experience. 

When Baba sat down. He said to Dada, "Okay, now you call all the Margis 
and wholetimers who are near." 

Ramanandaji thought, "Baba will give me punishment in front of others." 
Dada brought about ten people only. 

Then Baba, who was wearing His undershirt, told Dada to bring His shirt. 
Apparently so that He could further formalize the punishment. 

Baba said. "In my pocket is my wallet. Give it to me." 

Baba took out ten 100-rupee notes, saying, "Ramananda, this is my physical 
help for your relief work. I know what you were thinking. But you should not 
worry. Whoever serves suffering humanity without thought of getting the 
slightest personal return has my blessing, and will get everything needed for 
doing that service. It is my promise." 

Ramanandaji happily accepted the money, but did not use it, because he felt 
those notes were something very special, having come from Baba's hand. He 
had never before (or after) seen Baba handling money. Anyway, from that 
moment, donations came in a large flow. 



91 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


and he increased the flood relief work such that many thousands were served 
every day. 

[ Author's note: Years later, I mentioned this incident to Ramanan-daji, and 
asked him if he still had the notes. He told me that when the accident happened 
in Bhopal causing the greatest leak of gas ever experienced in India, he went 
there and used that 1000 rupees to purchase the food for those people in the 
critical ward of the temporary hospital. All of them finally survived. Many of 
them believed they survived because the food had come from a monk. They 
never guessed the real explanation.] 

Selfless determination 

Calcutta. I was instructed to come to this so-called worst of cities to await 
my plane ticket to Sydney. It is a complicated place: overwhelming congestion, 
filth in almost every direction, noise, business, poverty, a smattering of modern 
technology, the desire for money, the desire for escape, the desire for 
development, and the desire to transcend it all. It's good medicine for whatever 
remains of my spoiled suburban syndrome. 

The house where I'm living is in South End Park, and it's special because 
Baba often stayed here. I suppose it is also a little cleaner than the average, but 
it's hard to say for sure, owing to the dim lighting, which I can't say makes it 
any more quaint. Of course anywhere other than the training quarters is an 
upward move for me 

During the afternoon I heard a faint knock. When I opened the 
door, I saw a Dada who I'd met once before. Thin and pale, he stood 
on the doorstep seemingly uncertain whether to enter or not. 

"Well, come in," I said, "and get out of the sun." 

Suddenly his knees crumbled, and he was lying at my feet. 

"Dadaji!" 

But he didn't reply. 

Shocked and confused, I ran inside the house to get help. I found a boy who 
had some sort of cleaning duty. Together we ran to the door. 

"Dadaji, Dadaji," the boy cried as he rubbed the Dada's forehead, which 
was covered with sweat. 

The Dada slightly opened his eyes, and then closed them again. Now I 
noticed he was still breathing, though irregularly. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 92 


Together we carried him inside and I ran to get some water. By the time I came 
back, the Dada was sitting up. leaning against the wall. 

"I must have fainted," he said weakly. "I'll go 

find a doctor," I said. 

"No, don't do that. I think it was just something I ate, or didn't eat. Too 
much work to do today." He struggled to stand up. 

"Dadaji, you need a doctor. Please rest," I said. 

But he insisted, and in a few minutes he was gone. 

I felt bad for him, inspired by him, and selfish all at the same time. Whether 
his behavior was right or wrong, I want to have the same selfless, determined 
spirit. 

A little dirty money 

The itch still remains to be on the move and working. On top of that, my 
financial situation is precarious. The office in Patna gave me only a train ticket 
to Calcutta and 150 rupees (about US$ 10). I wouldn't feel so bad spending the 
money at a miserly pace, but for the feeling that I'm not being properly sociable. 
Everyday I buy only the exact amount of vegetables I need, then eat a modest, 
self-cooked meal alone, consciously ignoring most of the opportunities I have 
to share it with whoever else happens to be around. But if I share the little I've 
got, the money may not last until my ticket arrives. God knows when that will 
be. Of course. I've got to be practical, even if it looks a little greedy. 

Today I was alone in the house. Everyone else was out participating in a 
demonstration to protest Baba's imprisonment and the persecution of Ananda 
Marga. About two or three thousand Margis were there. I was instructed not to 
attend because I might be picked up and questioned by the police, and 
blacklisted from entering India. 

A knock on the door (this time a solid knock). Two youths smiled at me. 
They were perhaps twenty years old. 

The tall one said, "Namaskar. We are Margis. May we come in?" 

"Of course," I said, happy for the company. I took them into the main room, 
and we sat down on the floor (a foregone conclusion, there being no chairs in 
the house). We talked back and forth about our origins. They were from a 
nearby village. 



93 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I asked them if they knew any devotional songs. They looked at each other, 
spoke between themselves in Bengali, and burst into a rhythmic song. 

Then they asked me to sing something, which I did. 

"Now, how about some meditation?" I said. 

"Yes, meditation is good," the tall boy said. 

"Fine. I'll go for half-bath first, and then you two can do half-bath." 

"Thank you." 

After about two minutes in the bathroom, I returned. "Ah, I'm very sorry," the 
tall boy said, "but I think we have to leave now. We did not tell our mother that 
we would be away so long." "Yes, and it looks like rain," the other said. "Well, 
that's too bad. Can't you just stay for a short meditation?" "No, we've really got 
to go..." 

As I stood up with them, I suddenly had a thought: "Maybe they aren't 
really Margis, and they stole my money." 

We walked toward the door. I thought, "No, it's impossible. The money is 
deep inside my bag in a secret place, and they'd never find it in such a short 
time." 

They left. The thought that they might have ripped me off kept nagging me. 
But I thought again and again, "I mustn't be so cynical and negative." 

Finally, just to still my doubts, I checked my bag. My wallet was gone. 

I ran to the door. Of course they were long gone, and untraceable. 

"What a damn fool I am! What an ignoramus!" I sat down thoroughly 
befuddled, bemoaning my situation. What was I to do now? 

The peculiar thing is that even in the midst of this crisis I kept thinking: 
"How intricately I calculated my food needs, hardly sharing a leaf of spinach 
with anyone—and now my little dirty money is all gone. Everyone could have 
nicely enjoyed together with me." 

On the plane to Hong Kong. In the last two days I've come to the 
conclusion that the robbery happened as another lesson to teach me to depend 
on Him rather than on my little self. Having no money, I was forced to depend 
on hand-outs. 

Call it coincidence if you like, but yesterday my ticket to the Philippines 
arrived. There I will meet my higher authority—the Dada who 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 94 


will supervise my work in Australia. Without a penny in my pocket I boarded 
the plane. A businessman sitting next to me asked the meaning of my uniform, 
and that led into a long discussion about yoga. 

At the end of the flight I mentioned to him that I had no money. Without 
any hesitation he gave me five dollars, which was much more than the stolen 
money. Having been poor so long, I was elated with the first donation I ever 
solicited. 

Big task for a small boy? 

Manila, Philippines. My posting is the South Pacific Sector 27 but I'll stay in 
the Philippines for a few weeks because my Sectorial Secretary is here in 
Manila with temporary visa complications. As I am his only subordinate, it 
means I shall be working alone for some time in the South Pacific sector. If 
anyone were to say, "Sounds like a pretty big task for a new boy"—I would 
say, "I'm Baba's boy. Big or small, it's all the same for me." 

The dysentery which I caught almost one year ago in Benares is still 
ravaging my intestinal system. In an effort to clean it out. I'll be eating only raw 
fruits and vegetables for at least a month or two. 

Urgent and unurgent matters 

I've been working during these three days with the Southeast Asia Sectorial 
Secretary, Dada Adveshananda. 28 Adveshanandaji is an interesting man. He 
doesn't care for anything except maximum working speed, and that too he does 
with a smile. A man without a system. I suppose he even races through his 
dreams at night. 

While walking through town today with him and two local full-timers 29 , I 
said, "Excuse me, Dadaji. Part of your turban is hanging out." 

I was running to keep up with him. 

27 For organizational purposes, Ananda M arga divides the world into nine sectors. The South 
Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and most of the South Pacific 
islands. 

28 Southeast Asia Sector includes the Philippines, and the rest of Southeast Asia from 
Thailand down to the edge of the South Pacific Sector. 

29 Local full-timers are volunteers who work full time for Ananda M arga, usually for a 
specified period of time, and who follow a yogic discipline during that period similar 
to that prescribed for acharyas 



95 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"What's that you say, my little one?" He seemed always to be thinking a 
hundred things at once, and one needed to be very direct to get through to him. 

I repeated myself loudly in his ear. 

" Acha, I got you," he said. He turned to one of the full-timers, saying, 
"Ramdas, you've got a scissors with you, don't you?" 

We were still walking in top gear. Ramdas handed over the scissors. 
Adveshanandaji instantly cut off the protruding orange strip, and threw it in a 
garbage can as he passed. In the next moment he turned to the other full-timer 
to talk about an urgent matter. 

You're the program 

I asked Ramdas today to tell me something about Adveshanandaji. He told 
me that Dada had worked most of his life in India. During a one-year stint in 
Europe, he traveled incessantly, often passing the nights sleeping in telephone 
booths. During that time he initiated into meditation more than 1000 people. 

He arrived in the Philippines two years before. He openly stated several 
times, "My main work here is the creation of Dadas and Didis." 

One time he instructed a local full-timer to prepare to travel to a distant 
Philippine island to start Ananda Marga there. That full-timer spent more than a 
month earning sufficient money for the trip. With Dada's permission, he went 
to his posting, taking two days to go there. 

After arriving at the island, he found a telegram addressed to him: "Return 
to headquarters immediately. Adveshananda." 

The full-timer returned as quickly as possible. When he entered the Manila 
yoga house, he ran up to Adveshanandaji. 

"Dadaji, I'm here!" 

"Hmm. What?" 

"Your telegram ... so I came like lightning. What's the program?" 

"Ah, yes. You're the program. Good work." 

"Dadaji, is there some urgent work for me or...?" But it was too late for 
further questions. Adveshanandaji had already turned to some other matter. 

Ramdas added: "Recently that full-timer went to training to become a 
Dada, so I guess it worked. Dadaji breaks our attachments left and right." 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 96 


I asked for another example of Adveshanandaism. 

Ramdas said, "One time about 600 Margis were collected together for an all- 
Philippines retreat. Two days into the program we were having a 24-hour kiirtan. 
About half-way through the kiirtan, Dada mounted the lecture stage, held up both 
of his hands and yelled, 'Stop the kiirtan!' Everyone was shocked, but we stopped. 

"Adveshanandaji stood there visibly vibrated. He said, 'Dharma Maha 
Samelan (DMS) will now be held!' Everyone was even more shocked. Baba 
personally allocates His representative for this specially planned event. Of course 
no one had planned that this present program would be a DMS, and so, well, 
simply speaking, it could not be a DMS. 

"But there stood Adveshanandaji, his eyes closed, his hands held up. The 
room became totally silent, everyone filled with excitement and expectation, as 
we awaited the 'DMS' speech. 

"Instead of a speech, however, Adveshanandaji began speaking over and 
over, 'Baba, Baba, Baba... 1 He became louder and louder, and super intense. Then 
we were all yelling 'Baba! Baba!' Several Margis collapsed in samadhi 30 . I never 
felt anything so strong in my life. 

"I think about ten Margis volunteered to go for wholetimer train¬ 
ing after that." 


Baba starts fasting 

April. Word came today that Baba has begun a protest fast over the lack of 
inquiry into the attempt on His life in the jail by Indira 1 Gandhi's government. At 
present He is taking only two small glasses of orange juice per day. 31 


30 Samadhi means a state of complete absorption. There are many kinds of samadhi depending on 
the psycho-spiritual level of the person. In the higher for ms of samadhi, one feels oneness with the 
Cosmic M ind, or an all-consuming devotion for God or Guru. 

31 In February of 1973 the prison doctor administered Baba a strong dose of poison 
which he had passed off as a special "medicine". Baba temporarily lost consciousness 
and when He awoke, He was blind, His brain seared with pain. This condition lasted 
for several days, after which He partially regained His sight. Baba's vision remained 
somewhat impaired until the end of His life. The doctor, who was certainly hired for 
this nasty work by higher officials of the Indira Gandhi government, soon afterwards 
gave up his profession, but this did not save him from becoming permanently para¬ 
lyzed in the same hand by which he gave the poison to Baba. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 97 
An orchestrated accident 

Sydney, Australia. Fresh, young, curious, clean—all are qualities of this 
relatively new country and its people. I arrived two days ago in this world 
which seems open-minded to the ideas of yoga and Tantra. 

Ananda Marga is a new and small group here. There are a handful of 
Margis in each of several cities. 

I know I'm going to enjoy this country. 

Today a letter arrived from Ramdas. He writes: 

Something terrible has happened. A small accident happened in the car in 
which Dada Adveshananda was riding. The driver requested Dada to wait alone 
in the car for an hour while he assisted the passengers to go home by other 
means. 

Shortly afterward, a man approached Dada and asked him to leave the car. 

"What's it to you if I sit here?" said Dada. The man walked away silently. 

After a few minutes he again came back and said, "Really, sir, I think you 
should move." 

"You're a nonsense fellow," Dada said. "Leave me alone." 

And again a few minutes later he came and said. "I'm sorry to disturb you, 
sir. but..." 

"Get out of here!" Dada yelled. "If you're sorry to disturb me, then don't 
disturb me." The man left. 

A few minutes later a big construction truck smashed into the car. Dadaji 
was thrown out of the car, and dragged underneath the truck. 

It was awful. The construction people together with the ambulance people 
pulled him out of the wreck. He was unconscious and his legs were smashed. At 
least he did not die, though even for him it was a shock. 

In M arch, Baba dictated a number of letters to the governor of Bihar state complaining 
about the attempted murder and demanding a judicial inquiry. When Baba received no reply He 
took the further step of writing the governor and many other officials, and informing them that 
He would noteat until His poisoning was properly investigated and there was an improvement in 
His living conditions and those of the other M argis in the prison who were being detained under 
conditions far below the minimally acceptable standard for political prisoners.

He is still in the hospital but will probably be released in a wheelchair. The 
doctors say he may never be able to walk again, and he laughs at them. Yes, 
he's already recovered his aplomb. 

Most interesting, however, is Dada's own self-analysis. He says, "Everyone 
was always telling me to slow down, and be a little systematic. But I wouldn't 
listen. Baba Himself knew that even if He told me directly, I wouldn't listen. 
This was the only way that I could leam my lesson. Ah. the grace of Guru is 
unfathomable." 

As to that man who tried to warn Dada, no one ever saw him again. Dadaji 
says, "It was surely Baba in another form, just trying one last time to 
constructively cure me of my egocentricity. In my case, however, there was no 
way except destruction." 

The dysentery is still with me. I've been following a fruits-only diet, and 
going to naturopaths, chiropractors, colon-therapists, and the like, but nothing 
works. 

How I tolerate it, Lord only knows. 

Psychic power attack 

Brisbane. I've been invited to make a house-call tonight under peculiar 
circumstances. The residents are nine young men and women, a normal sort of 
communal living arrangement. It seems they are troubled by an "outside force." 
They've already called upon a Christian priest and a Buddhist monk to help 
them but neither visit satisfied the group. The priest did an ineffective exorcism, 
and the Buddhist monk counseled them to "ignore the illusion." Whatever the 
problem may be, it will at least be enjoyable to watch Baba solve it. 

They were a normal group of kids in their late teens and early twenties, 
except that they all looked haggard and emotionally strained. Without 
exception, each had facial skin sag. 

"Let's come to the point," I said. "Tell me the problem." 

They all started nervously speaking at once. 

"Please, there's nothing to get excited about. Every problem exists for a 
good reason." I pointed to the boy who looked the least out of control, and 
asked him to explain. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 


99 


"Dadaji, all of us in this house are so tired. Every night for the last two 
months a Psychic Power attacks us between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning." 

"It's terrible!" 

"I can't take it another night." 

"You've got to help us!" 

"What does the Psychic Power do?" 

"I don't know how to describe it exactly, but it seems to be more or less the 
same for all of us. We wake up with our minds racing, full of fear, imagining 
the worst things emerging from the shadows. Until now nothing much has 
happened externally, but our minds go nuts for about half an hour or an hour. 
Sometimes things fall off shelves, or the walls shake, or a door slams. Whether 
we sit down, lie down, talk or try to be silent, it doesn't matter. We feel like we 
are going crazy. Then it stops. But who can sleep after that?" 

After that they all chipped in little tidbits of experience, but the common 
nightly phenomena appeared to be approximately as the boy had described. 

I closed my eyes, thought about Baba, and quickly understood what to do. 

"I'm going to sleep in your house tonight," I said. "When the Psychic Power 
hits, wake me up." 

"No need. It will wake you up before we get to you, Dadaji." 

"Perhaps. Anyway, we will do a meditation exercise together, and become 
one hundred percent positive. In that state of mind, no black force can have any 
effect. If your minds are weak, if you have fear, then bad people with a little bit 
of power can easily control you. But we will concentrate on the most beautiful 
and positive entity, the infinite entity: God." 

Then I explained the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra. We sang it together for a 
couple of minutes, and did one minute meditation. 

"Tonight we will do it together as long as necessary." 

Soon after, we went to sleep—at least those of us who could sleep. 

In the morning the rising sun woke me up. I went downstairs to the dining 
room, and found everyone there. 

"What happened? Why didn't you wake me up? Or didn't the Psychic Power 
hit last night?" 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 100 


"Oh, it hit all right," one of them said. "But you were sleeping so 
nicely that we decided not to wake you up and to first try singing the 
mantra without you. And it worked, Dadaji!" 

"Immediately!" 

"Like a charm." 

"Yeah, the very moment we started singing, the Power disappeared. 
We were so happy that we continued singing for a long time, and then 
did meditation." 

"Very peaceful, beautiful." 

They were all smiling, the sun streaming in through an open window. 

Suddenly there was a loud knocking on the door. We all jumped up and ran to 
see who it could be at such an early hour. 

A lady was standing on the doorstep. She had long, uncombed black hair, 
deep shadows under her eyes, and a wrinkled black dress. 

She pointed her finger at me, and said with spit coming out of her mouth, "I 
hate you!" Then she slammed the door shut as loud as she could. 

Two of the boys opened the door and went after her. A minute later they came 
back. "She drove off in a car with no license plates." 

"Anyway, she won't bother you anymore," I said. 

After the psychic power incident one month ago, I visited the house a couple 
times more. I explained our spiritual philosophy in a little detail so that they could 
understand the undefeatable power of God's love. They all learned and regularly 
practiced meditation after that. 

Today the boy who seemed least out of control entered our local full-timer 
training course. 

I am convinced that the lady we saw was experimenting on this group of kids 
with some kind of psychic power, trying to take over their minds or something. 
At the moment that they all started singing Baba Nam Kevalam, her evil 
intentions probably reflected back on her with multiplied strength. She must have 
suffered badly that morning. 

Water cure 

Melbourne. Two weeks ago I was reading through Baba's health book Yogic 
Cures & Natural Remedies to find a treatment for one 



101 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Margi brother. How many scores of times had I looked at the chapters on 
digestive disorders? But this time one instruction made me pause: "The patient 
must drink small amounts of water as frequently as possible-totaling at least 
four to five liters per day." I had tried everything to cure myself. Why hadn't I 
tried following that simple directive? 

Since then I've been drinking a little water, up to half a cup at a time, about 
every fifteen or twenty minutes, except during and just after meals. And—Lord 
have mercy on this body!—it looks like my old friend Dysentery has finally left 
me. 

By now my intestines are probably completely shot. I have absolutely no 
appetite so I make sure my meals are separated by at least four to five hours. 

All in all, my health problems have challenged my practice of con-tentedness. 
If I can maintain contentedness while I'm this sick, I guess I can maintain it just 
about anytime, anywhere. Is this part of the meaning of Ananda Marga, the 
"path of bliss"? Thnt no matter what happens, good or bad, it helps spiritual 
development? 

An itchy test cum education 

Four months later. Sydney. 1974. One week ago in New Zealand, I visited 
my higher authority, Dada Sumitananda. At the time, a little eczema appeared 
on my nose. He suggested that I fast on herbal teas and pure fruit juices for a 
few days to clear out the excess toxins. The fast would give the toxins a chance 
to come out. 

Well, they sure did come out—like a parade on Madison Avenue. Now my 
whole body is covered with the eczema. It itches terribly. Though I look 
terrible, I continue my normal touring, and also continue the fast. 

Two weeks later. Brisbane. The eczema has become worse. It's now a thick 
brown cake, cracked and oozing pus. I have to change my clothes at least twice 
a day. Though I try my best not to scratch, the itch is so great that I 
unknowingly claw myself. I wear gloves to control my hands during sleep. 
Sometimes, however, I wake up to find that I've unconsciously taken off the 
gloves and had a good scratch. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 102 


Doctors are of no use. From today I've stopped even the teas and juices, and 
now drink only mineral water. Anyway, I don't have any hunger. 

Still my lecture tour continues. I don't know what the public thinks, because 
I don't talk about my condition, and neither do they. In any case, there are still 
plenty of new people asking to learn meditation and yoga. 

It's all so bizarre. 

Three days later. Yesterday, a group of Margis invited me for a day's outing 
to a lake. While I was telling stories to the Margis, a drunk suddenly interrupted 
us, saying, "Man. ah you a Yoogy?" 

One brother answered him. "Yes, he is." 

"Then how's come's you's got all that gook all over yur body? Wha kind o' 
Yoogy's got sooo yecchy? Huh? How's you goin explaain?" 

"It's a test I'm undergoing to strengthen my mind." 

Everybody was silent. The drunk stared at me like his eyes were going to 
pop out. 

"Well I like dat," he finally said. Coming over to me, he shook my hand, 
again exclaiming, "I like dat!" Then he walked away with a cheery jaunt. 

The Margis also liked dat. 

Ten days later. Adelaide. About a week ago the eczema started to get a little 
better. But the progress was so slow that I finally lost faith, even in the water 
fast. After one month of fasting I gave it up and started to eat fruits. Within two 
days I became 50% better. I'm astonished. How could eating help me more than 
fasting? 

One possible answer is that the elimination of toxins was halted when my 
system switched gears in order to digest food. But a more likely reason, I feel, 
is that my mind no longer required such an intense disease—enough was 
enough. 

For nearly three months I've eaten only fruits and raw vegetables. Still, the 
eczema did not become more than 75% better. A few days ago I hit another 
"enough-is-enough" point. I started eating bread, 



103 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


cooked foods, sweets—everything. Within two days my skin was completely 
clear (though I still have no appetite). 

Thanks, Baba, for the education in nutrition, fasting and mind-games. 32 

[ Author's aftemote: An Indian Margi, Chandra Prakash of Patna, told me a 
similar story, which he had rarely mentioned to anyone else. In 1983 and 1984, 
at the age of 34, he started feeling a constant pain in his intestines. Whenever 
he ate even the smallest amount of food, he vomited. Thus he was compelled to 
stop eating. Finally, for a period of four months, he drank only fruit juices and 
a little milk. In the third month he underwent medical analysis. The doctor told 
him that he had intestinal tuberculosis and prescribed medicine. After fifteen 
days of treatment, Chandra Prakash could no longer stand the intense reaction 
produced by the medicine. He went to another doctor who told him that the 
diagnosis of the first doctor was wrong, and that in fact the sickness was cancer 
of the colon. He said that an operation would have to be performed within three 
days, and sent the patient to the appropriate section of the hospital. But the 
doctor in that section told Chandra Prakash that he would have to wait six days 
before they could perform the operation. In the meantime, further tests were 
conducted. On the fifth day, Dada Shraddhananda (who became president of 
Ananda Marga in 1990) arrived at Chandra Prakash's house unexpectedly and 
said, "Somehow I felt you were in trouble, so I came." When Dadaji heard that 
an operation was intended for the following day, he said, "No. You must not 
undergo that operation. If you do, it will kill you. In fact you have no real 
illness. You should only have faith in Baba, and you will be cured." 
Accordingly, Chandra Prakash did not go to the hospital. Some days later he 
heard that the last tests had been inconclusive. A few days after that, he went to 
Ananda Nagar to attend the semi-annual spiritual festival with Baba. At the end 
of 


32 Besides teaching yoga and meditation throughout the entire period of these fluctuations in 
my health and appearance, I also helped to organize our first service projects in Australia - a 
permanent soup kitchen for derelicts, two full-time non-profit food cooperatives, and a 
kindergarten according to Baba's neo-humanistic education system. The kindergarten was 
registered with the Sydney city government under the name" Sunrise School". 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 104 


the festival, as usual. Baba gave a blessing which begins, "May everyone be 
happy, may everyone be free of illness...." In the middle of the blessing Chandra 
Prakash stood up angrily and said. "What You say. Baba! I have been suffering 
for two years, and You say everyone should be healthy!" Without waiting for 
the end of the session, he stamped out of the hall and marched over to a food- 
stall. He purchased six plates of pakora (deep fried potatoes and flour), a plate 
of milk-sweets, and finished it off with a glass of tea. He then walked back into 
the hall and announced to his father how he had broken his four months of 
fasting. The old man was shocked. A few minutes later, Chandra Prakash ran 
out of the hall again, this time to vomit. After vomiting, he entered the hall 
again and announced that he was cured. From that moment he was never again 
troubled by the slightest digestive ailment.] 

No need to trouble Him 

Hobart. Today I delivered a general introductory lecture to the staff and 
students of a local high school—over 2000 people. While waiting in a separate 
room beforehand, I was shivering due to the chilly weather (it's winter here) and 
also due to my nervousness before the talk. As usual I thought about Baba in 
order to calm myself. 

Then a thought occurred. "Why am I troubling Baba to calm my mind? I 
should simply think of Baba, give my mind to Baba, let Him speak through me, 
and not care what He does to me." I continued to think of Him. but without 
asking for anything except to be His channel. 

I was alone. The vice-principal came to fetch me. Though I was perceptibly 
shaking, she said nothing. Then I stood before the audience, still shivering. I 
was determined not to ask Him for anything except the proper words. 
Throughout the speech I trembled like a song-bird. 

Afterward, while returning to the yoga house, a full-timer who was sitting in 
the audience said to me, "Dada it was an excellent lecture. But there's one thing 
I don't understand..." 

Now I was sure that he would criticize me for shivering. 

"How could you be so perfectly calm in front of thousands of people?" 

I was surprised. "Perhaps we each perceive the infinite Entity only in the 
way which is suitable for our own evolution. So there's nothing to worry about."

He was satisfied with my answer, even though I meant something different 
than he understood. 

The aura of His love 

Perth. Today I gave a lecture to the Parapsychology Club of Perth. When I 
stood up in front of the audience, I had no idea what I was going to speak 
about. As usual I thought, "Baba, Baba, Baba..." The flow came, and I began to 
speak. 

After the formal program was over, several people came up to meet me. 
One lady said, "Dada, before your lecture I was enjoying just looking at you. 
You had a beautiful blue aura all around your body, like I've never seen before. 
Of course you know that such blue means cosmic love." 

I casually shrugged my shoulders. 

"But in the few seconds just before you started to speak, the blue light 
suddenly became so bright that I couldn't tolerate it. I closed my eyes but the 
aura was still there. Could I ask what you were thinking about at that moment?" 
"I was thinking about my Guru,” 

Anandamurtiji...the essence of love. 

Auckland, New Zealand. I have a new posting: Wellington Regional 
Secretary, responsible for New Zealand. The nature of the people here seems as 
gentle as the sheep for which this land is so famous. 

Baba admits a fraction of His knowledge 

Christchurch. A newsletter arrived from India today explaining the latest 
developments in Baba's court case. Here is an excerpt: 

"The judge asked Baba one of his usual questions: Tn what language will 
you address the court?' (In India there are forty major languages, so it is often 
necessary to arrange translation.) Baba replied, 'As I know over 200 languages, 
I can speak in whatever language the court prefers.' The judge was shocked by 
Baba's answer, and could not speak. After waiting a few moments. Baba 
politely offered, 'Perhaps it will be most convenient for the court if I speak in 
English: strict Oxford English.' The judge readily agreed." 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 106 


Though Baba's statement was surprising, I believe it was modest. Many 
workers declare that He surely knows all languages. I speculate that His not 
admitting this vast knowledge is in accordance with His long-standing habit 
never to directly refer to His own omniscience. Nevertheless He spoke the truth 
because He said "over 200 languages." 

Nelson. There are some signs that I may soon be transferred to another 
region. In that light I am happy that before my going, we have succeeded to 
open the Nelson Sunrise Pre-school. Twelve children are already attending. 

An all-violins orchestra 

Nandi, Fiji Islands. 1975. Today I'm reminded of Milarepa, the great 
Tibetan yogi. His guru. Marpa, ordered him to wander continuously through 
the mountains, never staying in any place more than three days. 

We Dadas are not much different. Not only do we constantly travel from 
city to city, but our postings can change at any moment. One day we are in 
New Zealand, the next—who knows? Fortunately, I enjoy this sort of life. 

My posting is now Suva Regional Secretary, responsible for the Fiji 
Islands. 

Lataoka. At night the mosquitoes are thick as pea soup. Whenever we do 
evening meditation I have to keep my entire body covered, including a light 
cloth over my head. 

This evening, however, during group meditation, I became fed up with the 
cloth on my face. It was one problem or the other. For once, why not let the 
mosquitoes have their way? 

After taking the firm determination not to move, I took the cloth off my 
head. 

One mosquito landed on my nose and took his dinner. He called his friends, 
and they made it a party. "Hey everyone, no charge! Banquet on the nose," they 
whined. They didn't seem interested in any other part of my face. 

My nose began to itch tremendously. But I refused to move. My mind flew 
back and forth between my meditation and the festival on my nose. The violins 
rose toward a crescendo, while the itch turned 



107 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


into a downright pain. I felt like a hundred party-goers in tuxedoes and black 
evening gowns were dancing on my pink beak. 

My mantra was striking like a hammer in my head, while the pain turned 
into a constant throb. The human snout converted into a vibrating vermin 
paradise. For all I knew, it might have been flickering between red and blue 
like an electric clown-nose. The throbbing became so intense, tears came out of 
my eyes. 

Suddenly two things happened simultaneously. My nose turned numb, and 
my concentration dropped deep within. I became oblivious—not only to my 
nose but to everything except the meditation. 

When the meditation ended, I turned around to give a talk to everyone 
there. 

"Oh, Dada! What happened to you?," they exclaimed, shocked. 

My nose had doubled in size. 

I laughed and proceeded with the talk. 33 

Tropical fever 

An epidemic is sweeping the island. Now Dinkar (our local full-timer) has 
caught it. The symptoms are high fever and acute body pain. Many have died, 
and everyone requires hospitalization for at least a couple of weeks. I 
suggested to Dinkar that he try to cure it in a yogic way. From today he will 
follow a fruits-only diet, and practice certain yoga postures. Otherwise he is 
resting in our hut. 

In only five days Dinkar was cured. I believe it could have been quicker 
except that he broke his diet once by eating a few biscuits. In any case, the 
Margis and other friends are very surprised he could overcome the disease 
without medicine and in such a short time. 

Nandi. Now I've got the sickness! Today I ate only papaya. Though bed¬ 
rest is recommended, I am practicing yoga postures in double quantity, and 
keeping up with all my normal work. Of course I keep my face far away from 
anyone else's to avoid contaminating them. Being 

23 19 years later: The most interesting thing is that for many years after that not a single 
mosquito bit me on my face. In the last few years perhaps four or five mosquitoes have nibbled 
my face a little, but none have yet dared to prick my nose. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 108 


continually on the move makes me sometimes feel very weak, but at least it 
keep my mind high. 

Two days later. Lataoka. Yesterday I stopped eating and only drank lemon- 
water. And today I observed full fast without water. I almost fainted several 
times while working but my mind was unaffected. Tonight the fever left me. 
Though I am still weak, I am sure the virus is out of my system. 

One of the Margis is a newspaper editor, and he wanted to print an article 
about my overcoming the disease in only three days. I told him I didn't want 
any publicity until my residence visa was secured. 

Indira Gandhi plays her role in the cosmic drama 

27 June. Recently there have been ominous developments in India. Two 
weeks ago the High Court in Allahabad found Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 
guilty of election fraud. Because it was just a matter of time before she would 
have been impeached and lost her Prime Ministership, yesterday she declared a 
federal state of emergency. Martial law was imposed. I fear the worst. 

4 July. Today I received a phone call from Sydney. Yesterday Ananda 
Marga was banned in India. Mrs Gandhi declared twenty-six organizations to 
be illegal. Of these, one was Ananda Marga and twelve others were 
organizations directly and indirectly related to Ananda Marga, such as 
Renaissance Universal (a club for intellectuals) and various Prout groups. It 
seems that all of our institutions in India were closed, and that all of our Dadas, 
Didis and well-known Margis have been arrested. Our Central Office is being 
shifted to Katmandu, Nepal, with an assistant Central Office in Denver, USA. 

My own reaction is mixed. On one hand I'm horrified. Many of my 
brothers and sisters may have to suffer severely. Perhaps some will even die 
before this episode is finished. But at the same time I feel the banning was 
inevitable, and will eventually turn to our advantage. Surely it is a part of 
Baba's planning. Ananda Marga is a revolutionary movement, albeit a peaceful 
one and the corrupt will not give up their power without a fight.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Furthermore, Tantrics must be able to undergo any sort of trial. And 
nothing teaches better than direct experience. 

That's why I remain not only optimistic, but am, indeed, positively inspired 
by these events. 

Money: a mere game for Him 

Nandi. No matter what happens in India, our normal work everywhere else 
must continue. 

Whenever Dinkar and I run out of money here, we are unable to look to the 
Margis for assistance because most of them are very poor. So we resort to 
taking the rounds of the shops, requesting donations. The shopkeepers usually 
each give a dollar or so. 

Today when we entered the city center, imagining how our piggy bank 
would soon be bulging, a shopkeeper approached and said: 

"Please don't mind my words. Haven't you noticed that many of the 
merchants have started to avoid you?" 

"Do you mean...?" 

"Yes," he said, "they're tired of giving you donations." 

I thanked him, and he left us. 

Both Dinkar and I were stunned. 

"The last thing we want to do is offend them," he said. 

"Sure. From this moment we won't ask a dime from them." 

"Then how will we exist?" 

"That's Baba's problem. We just have to do the work." 

There was an uneasy silence between us. Then I exasperated Dinkar further 
by saying, "And today's the day we have to send our monthly five dollars to the 
sectorial office in Sydney. It's our duty, and no matter what our own situation, 
we must send the money." 

"But we'll then be really stranded!" he said. 

"From my side I'm going to send $2.50," I said. 

"Well... I tnink we better save my $2.50 for emergencies," he said. 

"Suit yourself." 

Half an hour later when we got to the post office he had changed his mind 
and we sent the whole five dollars. 

We have $4.20 remaining which we've decided to use only on bus fares 
and other organizational expenses. And there is no food in our little hut, 
isolated halfway between Nandi and Lataoka. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 110 


Two days later. Having not eaten since yesterday noon, we visited our only 
relatively wealthy supporter, Senator Sharma. He was kind enough to donate 
large sacks of rice and potatoes. 

Four days later. In our hut in the countryside between Nandi and Lataoka. I 
was working on an article for our first newsletter when Dinkar interrupted me. 
"Dadaji, do you expect the money to simply fall from the sky?" He was feeling 
desperate, with only $2.60 in the cigar box. 

"Maybe. It's up to Baba how He wants to solve this problem. I'm not 
worried." The truth was, I was also getting pretty tired of our starchy diet. 
When would this test end? 

Ten minutes passed as we worked in silence. My mind drifted to Baba. 
Suddenly a thought entered: Sell advertising in the newsletter. 

I told Dinkar. He was skeptical. I said, "It was not my idea. I'm sure Baba 
put this thought in my head, so I'm sure it will work." 

Within five minutes we made the plan: first we'll quickly finish and print 
ten sample copies. These will be shown to prospective advertisers. The ads will 
be in their own separate section at the end. Dinkar can also draw illustrations 
upon order. We'll tell our clients that five hundred copies will be printed. 

Five days later. Baba's advertising scheme was successful far beyond our 
expectations. We made enough money to fully support us for the next few 
months and even pay for our plane tickets back to New Zealand when our visas 
expire. 

We have the duty to work as sincerely as possible. And He has the duty to 
provide the means for getting it done. Sometimes with a dab of extra whipped 
cream on top! 

My will against His 

Wellington. Our visas expired in Fiji, so we are back in New Zealand. 

We are receiving reports verifying that all of our workers and outstanding 
Margis in India are either in jail or in hiding. I continue my work, confident 
that everything will happen according to His wish. 



The Master of Testing, Caring and Hocus-Pocus 111 


Christchurch. On the bus today I thought, "What is the use of working like 
this unless I can see Baba? If I can't see Him in India, then I've got to make 
Him come here... I'll fast until He comes to me. I know He's got the mystic 
power, and if He wants to use it, He can easily do so." So I stopped eating or 
drinking from that moment. If I die or get sick it's His fault. I have every right 
to see Him. 

But I will continue all my normal work, and not tell anyone. If my higher 
authority comes to know, he might order me to stop the fast, and I would be 
compelled to comply. 

Nelson. The first day was a normal fast. But the second day was heavy. 
Today, my third day, the body seems to have adjusted a bit, and it's not so bad. 
Of course I'm damn thirsty. Anyway it's no problem for me. Let the suffering 
come, let sickness come—it will just speed up His coming to me. 

Auckland. Fifth day of the fast. Baba's very clever. The more I want to 
suffer, the more He protects me. Five days now without water or food. Some 
people would have died by now but I don't feel bad at all. It's impossible. 

Though my body's okay, my mind is wild with thirst. I've been having 
uncontrollable visions of waterfalls during meditation. 

What's He doing? Why doesn't He come? 

Anyway I'll fast to death if He refuses me. That will teach Him nicely not 
to play with me. 

Due to my traveling, nobody knows I've been fasting so long. Everywhere 
I go, the Margis think that I'm doing only a one or two-day fast. 

Wellington. Eight days now. You'll be in big trouble. Lord, if I die. It will 
cause all sorts of complications here, and I don't care. You're to blame. 

You have to come and see me. 

But there's one problem: I'm not suffering enough. Though my head 
constantly hurts and all the parts of my body have shrunk, I still don't feel 
anywhere near to death. Actually it's a bit of a drag. Just at the time that 1 don't 
want protection, that Trickster is somehow fortifying me.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


But I'll out-trick Him in the end. 


Next day. I was wrong. He's the master in hocus-pocus. Of course. 

The full-timer answered the doorbell this morning. The person at the door 
said, "Namaskar. I don't know why, but I suddenly got a strong feeling from 
Baba to fly here for a surprise inspection." He laughed and entered the room 
where I was sitting. 

It was my higher authority who had been in Australia for the last nine 
months. On seeing me, he was shocked. He immediately understood that my 
state of mind and body were far from normal. 

"So ... my Lord ... you're the cause. You must be the reason why He told me 
to come here." His voice was sharp. "What are you doing to yourself?" 

I smiled without replying. 

"You're doing long fasting, aren't you?" 

My shiny, shrunken head nodded. 

"How many days already?" 

"Eight," I said. 

"With or without water?" 

"Without," I smiled. 

"Baba! You're crazy. You could've died. What's the purpose of this?" 

"That's my own matter." 

"Buddha fasted 40 days, and he still couldn't get realization. You idiot. You 
won't get anything except very sick." He asked me to please stop. I refused. 
Then, as I feared, he formally ordered me to break the fast. 

I didn't get exactly what I wanted. But I did confirm for the umpteenth time 
that He does have omniscience, and He does have power, but He uses it as He 
sees fit. Not according to our wishes or demands. 

And I did find out that this body has the capacity to fast without water much 
longer and much more easily than I expected. Contrary to Dada's forecast about 
my getting sick, I feel completely healthy—better than in a long time. This may 
be useful information for the future when different catastrophes hit our little 
planet, and we cannot get the food or water we think we need. Even then, those 
of us who have sufficient mental power can continue serving humanity.

The violins test a new (already strong) Margi 

Tonga Island. My responsibility in the South Pacific Sector is coming to an 
end; I will be transferred to another sector. It's not yet clear which one. In the 
meantime I've been directed to travel through the South Pacific islands, ending 
up in Hawaii, where I will be sent a ticket to Denver. Since the Emergency 
began in India, Denver has been functioning as our temporary Central 
Headquarters #2. 

Two days ago I arrived in Tonga, which is less touched by "civilization" 
than any other place I've visited. I'm staying in a thatched hut with a family of 
thirteen. Usually one member of each large family has a job. The rest enjoy 
their simple life at his expense. 

And enjoy they do. Many of the adults are child-like, playing games all 
day. They have no sense of personal property. If anyone leaves a bicycle 
outside a shop, he can expect a new caretaker will assume responsibility for it 
by the time he comes out of the shop. If a car is parked for a few minutes 
without a guard, all of its removable parts will be efficiently removed by the 
time the driver returns. 

Almost every evening they ceremoniously pass around a coconut shell 
filled with a slightly intoxicating liquor made from a root like cassava. The 
ceremony gradually breaks down as singing, dancing and other sorts of 
pleasures take over. Their songs are sung in four or five part harmonies, the 
dances are rhythmically perfect, and as to the other pleasures—well, that's 
when I always go for a stroll. 

Though the people are simple, some are interested in meditation. I've 
initiated a few, and have been watching to see their sincerity. 

Late in the afternoon I went to the beach to meditate with one of the new 
initiates, a nineteen year old. During our meditation, the sun set. Mosquitoes 
came upon us in huge swarms. Though tolerating their attack, I briefly opened 
my eyes to see how my friend was doing. His nearly bare body was now 
clothed with a layer of mosquitoes, yet he sat stock-still. We remained another 
half hour. 

As we left the place, I asked him, "How was your meditation?" 

"S'was allrait. S'was verry good." 

"What about the mosquitoes?" 

"Dem was sommmm probalam. B' God was greater."

The king pushes his weight around 

Today being Sunday, I went to church. I had heard the king regularly 
attends a particular church, so I chose that one, hoping to get an eyeful. Until 
then, the closest I'd got to him was the sound of his daily motorcade, that is, the 
sound of scores of car horns blaring. Wherever he passes, the people make the 
same comment: "Da kiin's gonna i'spect 'is pigfaarm!" Then they roll on the 
ground with laughter. 

I was able to get a front row seat, immediately below the royal balcony. 
Shortly before the service started I got my eyeful alright. He's renowned as the 
fattest king in the world, well over 400 pounds. He was so big it seemed he 
could not support his own weight. While walking and huffing and puffing, he 
was assisted on either side by attendants. 

Though the king is obviously a devout Christian, I'm sure he allowed his 
eyes and mind to wander sufficiently to notice me last Sunday. The proof lies 
in my receiving today an official notification that I must leave this island 
within twenty-four hours. The only explanation, according to all the informed 
people with whom I've spoken, is that the king does not want any religion 
except Christianity propagated in his land. Needless to say, though I'm not 
teaching religion, my turban and orange uniform do create a sectarian 
appearance. 

He's a clever one. He waited all week to have the notice delivered to me at 
6:00 p.m. today. It is Friday, and all government offices are closed tomorrow 
so I'll have no opportunity to appeal within the allotted time limit. 

All of my new friends are outraged. For the first time I see them in 
something other than a joking mood. But they also are helpless. The king is 
known to be a stubborn man, and no one knows what to do. Out of desperation, 
a radio interview was arranged for me tonight, to publicize the injustice of the 
leave-order. 

The disc jockey himself was upset with the king, and gave me a full hour 
on the air. But when the program finished, he shrugged his shoulders, then 
embraced me and wished me well in my travels. 

A nice Vice 

Western Samoa. While traveling to teach meditation and yoga, I never stay 
in hotels. If I have no place to stay, I remain in a congested public

spot, and wait for a sympathetic person to offer me a spot in his house to spend 
the night. Even if someone wants to donate money for a hotel room, I 
gratefully refuse. One way or another, I eventually meet a noble person, and it 
invariably leads not only to a comer on the floor for my blanket, but also to 
someone keenly interested in spiritual development. And he or she usually 
introduces me to others with similar interests. My real purpose, which is not to 
eat and sleep, is thus automatically fulfilled. 

Facing such a predicament here, I took my stand in the midst of a busy 
crowd in the central marketplace. After two hours a young lady approached 
me. She was about twenty years old. 

"Sir, is there any way I can help you?" she asked. The quality of her 
English showed she was well educated. 

"I am a teacher of meditation and yoga," I said. "I want to meet people who 
are interested to learn, and, as I've just arrived, I also have no place to stay." 
Usually I come right to the point. 

"My father has always been interested in such things. Let me introduce you 
to him I'm sure he'll also offer you a room." 

She led me to her car. So she was not only educated, but also at least a little 
wealthy. 

Her house was so big I could not see where it ended. Walking past the 
servants and through several rooms, we reached the library, where a large, 
bulky man sat reading. He looked up as she entered and smiled. When he saw 
me, his smile broadened. 

"I've brought you a yogi, Daddy," she said. 

He rose and offered his hand, "1 am thrilled to meet you, sir. I've been 
waiting for your visit." 

Introductions were made. Among other things, he mentioned that only two 
years ago he had completed his term as the Vice-president of Western Samoa. 

These three days were packed with engagements. My host introduced me 
to scores of the country's upper-echelon who were keen to learn yoga. Most of 
them had health problems, for which I prescribed yoga asanas and appropriate 
diets. Some of them, including my host, are already improving. 

The most exciting programs often come last and then end prematurely. 
Today I received a telegram ordering me to leave immediately for Denver, 
from where I shall travel to my next posting: Europe.

Determination 


Dedication personified 

Stockholm, Sweden. 1976. My new posting is Regional Secretary for both 
Stockholm and Oslo Regions, otherwise known as Scandinavia (Finland, 
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Greelland). It is already clear to me 
that the people here are more gentle than North Americans, Indians and 
Australians. In my experience, only New Zealanders compare. The 
Scandinavians are also extremely open-minded and interested in anything new. 

I have four full-timers in my office here in Stockholm to assist me with my 
work. 

I don't think I've ever met a person as sincere as Suresh, one of my full- 
timers. Whatever he does, he does wholeheartedly, with full concentration. 
Since I introduced the daily schedule for the full-timers in the office, he has 
followed it strictly—to the minute. While doing yoga asanas, he carefully 
refers to the clock, and when the allotted time is finished, even if he has not, 
completed his exercises or the final deep relaxation, he jumps up, puts on his 
clothes and begins the next scheduled work. Likewise, at the end of meal time, 
even if half of his food is still on the plate, he gets up from the table. With 
work, meditation, sleep or any activity, he maintains the same punctuality. 
Needless to say, it was beginning to get on everyone's nerves. 

A couple of days ago I walked into the bathroom while Suresh was taking a 
bath. He had his clock there also. When the scheduled time was up for bathing 
he put on his clothes even though he hadn't dried himself yet. I think there 
remained a bit of unrinsed soap on him as well.

"Suresh," I said, "the schedule need not be followed exactly to the letter. It 
should rather serve as a guideline, which maybe adjusted in minor ways 
throughout the day to suit the needs of our work or meditation." 

"Really, Dadaji?" As he stood there, soaking wet, staring at me for several 
seconds. I felt like he was inputting this new attitude into his brain, deleting the 
erroneous elements of the old one. 

"I understand clearly." he said. 

From that very moment his timing has became, well, perfect. Yes, I can say 
'perfect' because his schedule adjusts with everyone, without wasting any time. 
Quite amazing! 

Suresh continues to amaze me. Since I first arrived, he's done everything 
with complete concentration and seriousness. Never laughing, never showing 
any mood. If he makes any mistake, including mental mistakes unknown to the 
rest of us, he punishes himself by doing fifty or a hundred tic-tics (stand-and- 
squats while holding ones ears), or by pressing his forehead to the floor. 34 I've 
been wondering what I could do to encourage him to be more human. 
Yesterday, unable to think of anything more subtle, I just told him bluntly , 
"Suresh, you needn't be so serious all the time. It's good to laugh sometime." 

"Really, Dada?" Again staring, re-programming. 

"Humor and happiness" I continued, "often help us to communicate, help 
us to be in His flow." 

A pause. Then he started to laugh. "Ha, ha, ha! I got your point, Dadaji." 

From that moment he's become a thoroughly pleasant, smiling person. 

A unique devotee. Who's 
helping? 

Oslo, Norway. I'm surprised that there are hundreds of homeless or 
otherwise impoverished people in this wealthy country. The Margis 

34 "Tic-tics" have a wonderful place in the history of Ananda Marga. If any Dada or Didi 
committed a mistake, they would often be instructed by Baba to perform some number of tic- 
tics in front of H im. At such a time, He sometimes commented, "This rectification exercise will 
not only exhaust your negative reactive momenta, it will alsc be good for your health." Later, 
when Baba began correcting the mistakes of M argis they too could enjoy this novel method of 
recovering one's mental balance.

organized a weekly soup kitchen. The very first day, a few of the recipients 
actually danced with joy to receive the vegetarian food from us. 

Copenhagen, Denmark. For the last three weeks, sister Kunti, a full-timer, 
has been searching single-mindedly for a suitable house to rent for our yoga 
center. This morning, though disheartened by her on-going failure, she set out 
to try again. 

She took a bus into the city. After a few minutes, an old lady boarded, 
walked directly to Kunti, and sat down next to her. The lady's face was full of 
both wrinkles and tenderness. 

"Nowadays many young people are misusing their energy," she said. "I am 
happy to see that you are a different type." 

She spoke in Norwegian, which is Kunti's mother language. It was odd, 
even bizarre. How could she know that Kunti was from Norway when Kunti 
had not yet spoken a word? 

"The task is elephantine," the old lady continued. "The speed must be 
accelerated. Don't you also think so. my dear?" 

As the woman stared in Kunti's face, a transformation occurred inside the 
bus—it seemed to billow like a river. Instead of waves of water, however, the 
air itself and the colors around were rippling, vibrating. An unidentifiable 
mixture of sound waves inundated the atmosphere. Kunti could no longer 
comprehend what was happening. She also joined the sea of vibrations. 

At last the lady said, "And I think you are looking for something. Isn't it, 
my dear?" The bus stopped. "Perhaps you will find it here. Let's get down." 

Her ankles barely able to support her legs, Kunti stepped outside with the 
lady. Without speaking a word, the lady, smiling sweetly, pointed at the 
building. Still lost in the cosmic current, Kunti entered the building. 

"Is there a flat to rent here?" asked Kunti. 

"Yes,” said the manager. "But how did you know? The ad has not yet 
appeared." 

"Ah. one moment, please," Kunti said. She walked back outside. The old lady 
was gone, never to be seen again. The flat was perfect, and we took it.

Rendering possible the impossible 

Oslo. Vishvabandhu and Sulocana, a married couple, have worked like 
mad people to start a public food cooperative. Obliged to quickly pay off the 
loan they took for the project, speed was compulsory—in planning, renting, 
construction, ordering, and publicity. Within a mere month they did everything. 
Today the shop opened in the center of the business district. It looks beautiful. 

Vishvabandhu said these words at the ribbon-cutting ceremony: "Tantric 
spirit made the impossible possible again." 

Considering that they hadn't a drop of experience in this line, I agreed fully 
with his statement. 

The United Nations gets a taste of Tantric resolve 

Stockholm. Yesterday, just as I arrived in Lulea, Karan phoned me from 
my Stockholm headquarters. "Dada, you won't believe this!" he said. "Suresh is 
publicly threatening to commit self-immolation within one week unless the 
government requests the United Nations to discuss Baba's case and Gandhi's 
banning of Ananda Marga! He's going to bum himself to death!" 

"What are you talking about? Let me speak to him." 

"Gladly, except that he's in hiding. He made his announcement by 
telephone to the government and the media. He called me also, but refused to 
tell from where." 

After asking many questions and receiving few clear replies from Karan, it 
was obvious that I had to return to Stockholm immediately. Just as I hung up 
the phone, it rang again: a reporter from the local newspaper. 

"Sir, do you think Stan Eklofs threat is real or simply drama?" 

"I'm believe it's real. It fits with his all-or-nothing attitude. That's why it's 
so urgent to take all possible steps to stop him." 

"Do you have any idea why he's taking such a desperate step? Is he alone 
in this escapade?" 

"Two or three weeks ago Mr Sarkar specifically suggested that Ananda 
Marga's case be presented to the United Nations. I suppose that when no one 
took the initiative, Stan decided to act. Though I understand and of course 
agree with his sentiment, his strategy is wrong and horrifying." 



Determination 


120 


After completing the interview, I set out for the station. Lulea is in the far 
north of Sweden, an overnight train journey to Stockholm. When I reached my 
office this morning, Karan greeted me, "Dadaji, a big article together with a 
photo has already appeared on the front page of the Lulea paper. The phone is 
ringing off the hook with reporters— they're impatient to meet you." 

"There's no time for that yet." Throwing my overcoat on the chair, I sat 
down at the phone to begin the work of trying to—trying to what? save a life? 
Yes...but surely life or death was in Baba's hands, not mine. "Alright, Lord, use 
me as You see fit," I thought. 

An hour later 1 was at the office of the United Nations. 

"This is a totally unprecedented affair," said the chief representative, Mr 
Johanson, a typically polite and self-composed Swede. "How can you expect 
the Swedish nation to agree to present the case of a convicted murderer to the 
United Nations because of a suicide threat? It will be better that you convince 
Mr Eklof of the futility of his undertaking." 

"I don't think he'll back down, sir. It is his nature. He's totally sincere and 
ready to sacrifice everything for what he believes in." 

"I understand. But you are asking for something impossible." 

"I'm not asking for anything, sir. This is Stan's demand, not mine. I'm 
simply concerned that you understand his determination. I don't want him to die 
a needless death. You have the power to rescue him." 

"Sweden cannot condone an act which boils down to terrorism— albeit in 
this case the victim and the terrorist are one and the same." 

"I don't agree with his tactics either, but his purpose is not destruction of 
the state or any other kind of violence. He only wants justice; that the case of a 
great and persecuted humanist be rationally presented to a global peace-making 
organization." 

"But his method..." 

"Sir, can't you at least discuss the matter with your staff?" 

"Discussion itself is not impossible... But at the same time you must try to 
contact Mr Eklof and persuade him not to immolate himself." 

"It goes without question that I'll do everything I can to stop him. But I 
know him too well, so I have more hope in your efforts. By the way, you know 
I don't have his phone number..." 

"I'll make a formal request to two or three leading radio stations to 
repeatedly air your request for Mr Eklof to call you," he said. 



Determination 


121 


We fixed an appointment to meet again the next day. 


This evening all three stations frequently announced: "This is an urgent 
message for Stan Eklof, the man in hiding who has threatened to immolate 
himself if the case of his convicted Indian guru, PR Sarkar, is not presented by 
the Swedish nation to the United Nations: Mr Eklof please telephone your 
headquarters in Stockholm immediately." 

Next day. Suresh called this morning. "Where 

are you?" "I can't say, Dadaji." 

"It's a wonder that nobody's recognized you. Your photo was shown on 
TV." 

"Ha, ha! I guessed no one would notice me." 

I told him about the inflexibility of the United Nations' representative. 
Then I requested him to compromise, to give the authorities more time and to 
return to press his demand in a respectful manner. 

"Sorry, Dadaji. I'm committed to this path." 

"But..." 

"Let His will be done! I'm more than ready to die if it's needed. Rather I'm 
expecting to die." 

I continued trying to convince him to alter his stand, but it was no use. 

"Alright, Suresh. I understand your position. I'll try my best to persuade the 
UN people." 

"Don't worry, Dadaji. Everything is Baba. It's all His drama." I asked him 

to call me regularly, and hung up. 


This afternoon I met again with Johanson. "Did Mr Eklof agree to give up his 
desperate gamble?" I told him of Suresh's unyielding attitude, then added, "And 
from your side, Mr Johanson, is there any news?" "Well...I...you see..." 

"I understand. You did not even talk about it with your staff, right?" "Not 
exactly..." 



122 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Mr Johanson, very little time remains. If Stan kills himself due to our 
negligence, we won't be able to sleep peacefully for the rest of our lives." 

"But he has no right to try to force the government's hand like this!" Was 
Johanson losing a bit of that typical Swede imperturbability? 

"At least you can try to discuss it with your staff. I've been trying. What 
about you? Besides, who can say what's really proper and improper in this 
immoral world? You cannot imagine the extreme suffering of Mr Sarkar and 
our hundreds of workers who are inside of abominable Indian prisons. And all 
completely unjust." 

"That's not the point! Mr Eklof is trying to blackmail us." 

"Perhaps the term is correct. If so, it's a minuscule crime compared with 
what the Indian government has been doing to us. Anyway, let's leave this 
aside. Our task is to overcome this impasse. Please, I'm begging you to at least 
discuss it with your staff. Can you do that, Mr Johanson?" 

He paused. "Alright...I'll do it...How many days do we have left?" "Four." In 
fact five days remained, but I thought it better to keep an extra day in my hand. 

We agreed to meet again the next day. 

This evening Karan spoke with Suresh's parents. They are sick with worry. 
We invited Mr Eklof to accompany us to tomorrow's meeting. 

Next day. "I have an offer to make," said Johanson. "Please tell Stan that if 
he calls off his threat to self-immolate, then we are prepared to discuss with 
him the possibility of presenting Mr Sarkar's case to the United Nations. Of 
course there are many complex details that need to be clarified before we can 
make a final decision as to whether or not it fits the protocol of the UN." 

"I understand you." I said, "and appreciate your proposition..." 

"Good—it's the most we can do..." 

"...but unfortunately I doubt Stan will accept it." 

There was an uneasy pause. Then Suresh's gray-haired father started 
speaking in Swedish to Johanson. Karan, who had until now been translating 
for Mr Eklof, now translated for me. "He says that it's a fine proposal, and 
surely Stan will have to reconcile himself to the fact that 



123 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


the Swedish government is stretching its rules to the limit on his behalf. He's 
very thankful to Mr Johanson." 

"I agree with you, Mr Eklof," I said. "What both of you say is rational and 
correct. But, please excuse me for saying this, Stan is prepared to immolate 
himself for this issue. He is certain to want something definite before 
relenting." 

"He must understand this is the absolute maximum the government can 
offer," Johanson said. "Now his fate rests with you, Dada. You have to 
convince him." 

I shrugged my shoulders and sighed, saying, "I'll do my best." 

After leaving the UN office, we took a taxi together with Suresh's father. 
On the way, he suddenly exploded. "Who's side are you on?" he yelled. "I think 
you prefer my son's death to the reasonable option given by Johanson! You are 
the cause of all this horror! You don't really care about Stan!" He went on 
screaming similar things, giving me no chance to reply, until at last he broke 
down weeping into his hands. 

Karan and I grimaced in pain. He gently rubbed Mr Eklof s back. We 
drove in silence, except for the sound of the old man's sobs. 

The taxi arrived at his house. Just before he got out, I said, "Please believe 
me, Mr Eklof. I love Stan deeply." 

Mr Eklof s face showed exhaustion. He gave a weak smile, turned and 
walked toward his house. 

I felt awful. I felt so bad for Mr Eklof that I had physical pain in my heart. 

Later Suresh called again. "You people are working so hard. And I'm here 
in hiding, carefree and enjoying my meditation. Dadaji, I hope these days are 
not too tiring for you all. Rest assured that I'm happy, happier than ever." 

"But you know, Suresh, if you don't accept the government's offer, you 
may be doomed. They insist this is the limit." 

"I understand, Dadaji. I expected it might be like this from the moment / 
first announced my resolution. If I die, it will provide just the right sort of 
shock to humanity." 

"Suresh, you can do infinitely more for humanity if you go on living and 
serving." 



DETERMINATION 


124 


"I don't know, Dadaji, and I don't care. I feel deeply that I'm doing exactly 
what Baba wants. I'm receiving His immeasurable grace every moment. The 
entire cosmos seems to be His smile, especially when I do meditation. So I 
have no doubt." 

"If you think like that, then what are we to do?" 

"What you are already doing is perfect. Please continue your efforts, 
unattached to their results. In the end it will happen according to His whim." 

"Suresh..." 

"I know it's harder for you all than for me, but I shall accept no 
compromise." 

Next day. "Damn it," said Johanson, "he's asking for the impossible." 

"I know," I said. "He's fully prepared to die." 

"Can't you provide any further lead as to where Eklof might be? Our 
investigators say they've already checked every imaginable link, and nothing 
remains except to search every house in the country." 

"No. No further clue. And I already told you that finding him is immaterial. 
Wherever you might keep him, however you try to restrain him, you'll never 
dissuade him from his resolution. I tell you, there's no other way. The only real 
solution is for Sweden to present Mr Sarkar's case to the United Nations." 

He didn't reply. We sat in silence for one or two minutes. 

"Sir, that's enough for this morning. If possible, please be in your office this 
afternoon, as I may need to call you." 

Johanson did call this afternoon, and completely astonished me. 

After hanging up, I waited impatiently for Suresh to phone. Thirty minutes 
later the phone rang. It was him. 

"The Swedish government's decided to put Baba's case to the UN!" I 
blurted out. "Can you believe it, Suresh? Congratulations!" 

“Tato Baba, tato dharma. Tato dharma, tato jaya," he said quietly and 
calmly. "Where there is Baba, there is righteousness. And where there is 
righteousness, there is victory." 

"I want to see you as soon as possible, Suresh. We should meet Mr 
Johanson also. Which is closer for you—our office or the UN office?" 



125 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"I can meet you in the lobby of the UN office," he said. "It's only a few 
minutes walk from where I am now." 

"You crafty fellow! Exactly where have you been staying?" 

"In the apartment of an old friend. By 'old' I mean he's more than 80 years 
old. And he never reads the newspaper or listens to the radio news. I told him 
my house is being painted. Ha, ha!" 

Before I left, Karan called Suresh's father. When he heard the news, he 
burst out, "Oh, thank God! Thank God!" He cried a bit, and then said, "Please 
accept my apology for what I said in the taxi yesterday. Without your efforts I 
think my son would have died." 

After waiting for ten minutes or so in the UN office lobby, I began to feel a 
bit nervous. Suresh should have arrived before me. 

Another man had also been standing there for a long time. Might he have 
seen Suresh? I approached him. He smiled. 

"For God's sake, it's you, Suresh!" 

He ripped off his false mustache, took off his bogus spectacles, and burst 
out laughing. We embraced each other, weeping like babies. 

His invisible hand 

Oslo. Talk about no experience. It's one thing to start a food cooperative; 
but it's an entirely different ball game to open a public printing press without 
the slightest knowledge. There lies the faith of the devotees. Bhagirath and 
Arjuna are confident that their enterprise will be successful. Isn't it wonderful 
that all of our projects offer on-the-job training? And most of them do so 
without any trainer! Unless you count the Supreme Trainer.

comes from kiirtan and meditation, but honestly I think that it's mostly through 
service that we really get to enjoy His company. I see Baba in my work, in the 
eyes of the people I meet, in the constant helpful 'co-incidences' that occur every 
day. in the struggles that test me and help me grow. After all. what else do I 
have? Though He insists on depriving me of His physical presence, I still have 
the right to demand that He shows Himself to me in my daily life. Of course, I 
would forego all that in a moment in exchange for letting me just once have His 
personal contact. 

An embassy becomes a guerrilla theater 

Copenhagen. Due to the imposition of martial law in India, Baba's case, 
which was already a travesty of justice, has turned into an unambiguous farce. 
Not a single witness from Ananda Marga's side was permitted to testify. By 
kangaroo-court. Baba has now been declared guilty of all charges. At first the 
judge declared the sentence to be the death penalty. Later, fearing Baba might 
be seen in the same light as Socrates or Christ, he changed his mind, and 
converted the sentence to life imprisonment. In a way this alteration allows us to 
feel a certain sort of comfort . 35 

My spiritual father is unquestionably suffering while fasting for years in a 
cell devoid of all conveniences. At the same time, thousands of my Indian 
brothers and sisters must also be undergoing daily agony in scores of other 
prisons as they refuse to give up their commitment to Ananda Marga's cause . 36 

In the face of this horror, however, I remain calm, even inspired. Though it 
may seem heartless, I'm convinced Baba is causing the whole drama to take 
place according to His plan. Sometimes great suffering is necessary though it is 
difficult to accept and even more difficult to live through. Despite the horror, 
despite the difficulties, I have faith that everything will turn out for the best. 

Rather than give into despair or anger, it is far better to keep a cool mind, 
and actively protest the conditions in order to help the public 

35 A few years later, both hands of this judge became permanently paralyzed. 

36 Two years later a book was published entitled Tales of Torture, which documented 
scores of cases of Dadas, Didis and Margis who were severely tormented physically and 
mentally by the jail officers. The twenty-two months of emergency in India were 
notorious for innumerable human rights violations.

to become more conscious. For Margis, the norm these days are public 
demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and meetings with influential figures 
throughout the world. Even though respected and sometimes famous 
individuals and organizations have investigated our cases, and have objected in 
detail to the flagrant injustices taking place, the Indian authorities remain 
unaffected. The Canadian representative of the International Commission of 
Jurists made a lengthy report spelling out how appalled he is by the bias 
against Ananda Marga. And a high-ranking Queen's Counsel from England 
pointed out over 200 loopholes in the prosecution's position in Baba's case. We 
have unquestionable evidence that the Foreign Office in Delhi sent several 
anti-Ananda Marga information packets to Indian ambassadors and embassy 
staffs of the world. The embassies have been instructed to distribute these 
packets to government officials in their respective countries so that Ananda 
Marga's development may be impeded. Accordingly, we continue to protest 
every way that we can. 

Today we had a special meeting. 

We informed a reporter of the biggest Danish daily newspaper of our 
intentions. Seven of us gathered this morning at the Indian embassy. The 
reporter also came, but he refused to come inside with us. He said he would get 
the news after we came out. 

It was chilly weather, so we were all dressed in full length coats. The first 
Margi entered alone, and began reading an Indian newspaper in the reception 
room. After a few minutes, a second Margi went inside and studied the visa 
application forms. Gradually, one by one, the rest of us entered and engaged 
ourselves in inconspicuous behavior. The usual staff were there, together with 
a handful of other people. 

Then one of us gave the signal. In a flash, we all jumped up, pulled signs 
from under our coats and launched into a long series of chants, like "Out with 
martial law!", "Arrest Indira Gandhi!", "Free Baba now!'', "Release political 
prisoners!", "Ananda Marga demands justice!" and so on. 

The staff was shocked. The lady employees began screaming at the top of 
their lungs. Some dove under tables. Clearly they thought they were under 
some sort of attack — perhaps that our continuous chants were the prelude to a 
spray of machine gun bullets or something. They screamed non-stop. I was 
really sorry for them, but I knew they would

recover within a few minutes. Well, to be honest, while one side of my brain 
was in pain, feeling compassion for these hapless souls, the other side, excuse 
me for saying, felt like laughing. I wonder if God often feels something similar 
when He views our melodramas. 

In the midst of this, the Indian ambassador himself appeared at the top of 
the stairs. I feared for his eyes which looked like they might dislodge 
themselves from their sockets. Before that could happen, however, he and two 
or three of his aids galloped down the stairs and with a roar, started raining their 
fists on our innocent bodies. One of the Margis deftly pulled out a camera, and 
snapped it again and again. When their attack failed to stop our parade, the 
ambassador flew into a rage at our camera-man, and tried his level best to 
expose the film by seizing the camera and throwing it to the floor. Though we 
were quite civil, I should even say polite (considering his discourtesy) in 
fulfilling our task, he pushed Kunti toward the door, utilizing every drop of the 
adrenaline which was pumping through his bloodstream. Perhaps worrying that 
some harm might be done to the door, a male staff member opened it, and the 
ambassador succeeded in tossing Kunti out. The reporter was standing there. 
Catching just the right moment, he snapped a photo. 

I am sure that the ambassador must have rejoiced to see the photo on the 
front page of the newspaper this evening. His face wore a frozen vicious scowl 
while he was thrusting Kunti onto the sidewalk. Of course, she had on her best 
expression of childlike astonishment at his uncouth behavior. The article was 
perfect, nicely detailing the injustice perpetrated by the Indian government on 
Baba and Ananda Marga. 

One day when the unscrupulous Gandhi regime has its downfall, the 
embassy staff may even feel thankful to us. 

Fate twisting 

Verona, Italy. All the Dadas and Didis of Berlin Sector are gathered here 
for several days of meetings. A visitor is also here: my father. It's the first time 
I've seen him since I left home over four years ago. These past few days we've 
taken every chance we could to get away from the others and talk. 

Today I initiated him into meditation. We were sitting on a blanket, under a 
bright sky, getting ready to begin when he started laughing.

"What makes you laugh in this serious moment?" 

He swallowed his mirth and said. "I'm sorry, sonny boy. But the irony is 
too much. In all truth, I admit I came here to convince you to give up this life, 
and return to America. But here I am, perched like a holy Hindu, about to 
acquire the esoteric knowledge from you. I thought I would convince you, but 
instead, you've convinced me."

CHAPTER 8 


Personal Contact 


Indira and her emergency both finish 

March 1977. Indira Gandhi's "emergency" in India ended today! She over¬ 
estimated her popularity. She permitted elections to be held and lost by the 
biggest landslide in Indian history, receiving only a few percent of the vote. 
Already reports are coming in that all our workers and Margis are being 
released from jail because Ananda Marga is legal again. They tried to crush us, 
but our movement has only been strengthened through facing and overcoming 
their persecution. 

Now it only remains for Baba and a few specially accused workers to be 
released. With the new Janata Party government in power I am hopeful that 
their cases will soon come up for appeal. 

I remember something very interesting. Over two years ago, Baba issued a 
warning from prison: "After six months a crisis will occur in India. All Margi 
families should store sufficient cereals and basic necessities to weather a period 
of two years." 

At the time we all thought He meant an earthquake or war was coming. Six 
months later Indira Gandhi announced the emergency, and most of the fathers 
in Margi households throughout India were thrown in jail. The Margi mothers 
and children were left to fend for themselves. Thanks to Baba's warning, 
however, most of them had stored sufficient food for this period, which turned 
out to last for nearly two years. 37 

37 Another story was later told by Brij Bihari through Dada Pranavatmakananda. It happened 
in 1971, when Brij was Baba's attendant during the short time that Baba was in the hospital. 
Whileentering thebathroom, with thedoor still half open, Baba

Reykjavik, Iceland. Rainjan and Vimala have opened a health food 
cooperative. This country hardly knows the expression "health food", 
and our shop is the first of its kind. Nevertheless, even on its first day, 
the shop was already full of customers. 

The bones of the immoralists will shake 

Patna, India. This is now the third time that I've been to India since 
becoming an acharya. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Margis have 
visited Baba in Bankipur Prison. 38 Only five or six Dadas from around 
the world, including me, are on a special prison black-list which does 
not permit us to enter His cell. Though I've applied many times for 
visiting privileges, the prison authorities always refuse. Twice I've met 
with the prison superintendent, only to receive the same reply. 

For some reason we select few are considered dangerous. It's surely 
due to the misinformation that commonly fills secret police files. One 
of our Norwegian Margis was able to gain access to Interpol's files 
through the help of a relative who works in Norway's undercover agent 
section. When he checked my name he found numerous false 
statements, including one declaring that I am sending $5000 every 
month by bank transfer to a revolutionary fund in America. The fact is 
that I've never sent even one penny to America. 

Today I decided to appeal directly to the Governor of the State of 
Bihar. When I arrived at the State Office, I explained that I was a Margi 
seeking an interview with the Governor. 

"The Governor is now out," the receptionist said, "but I'll see if you 
can meet the Vice-Governor." 

She left and came back after a few minutes. 

"I'm sorry. Sir. The Vice-Governor is too busy today." 

"How about tomorrow?" 

"It won't be possible," she said. 

nonchalantly said, " I n 1975 our organization will face a severe crisis. Even if you travel miles 
and miles, you will not meet anyone who will admit to being a M argi. It will be one of the most 
testing periods of the M arga.' 1 Without further comment He closed the door. Brij mentioned 
the episode to several other workers and M argis then, but no one knew what to make of it. 
3a Though Ananda M arga was by now legal and again functioning in India, Baba's case was still 
not resolved. The new J anata government ordered the courts to retry all cases decided during 
Gandhi's rule of martial law. This process was, of course, taking time.

"Alright, I can wait a few days. Just set the time." "I'm sorry, sir. Please don't 
mind, but he just doesn't want to meet you." 

I thanked her and walked out. After waiting outside for fifteen minutes, I 
walked in again. While the receptionist was diverted by another person, I 
walked by her unannounced. 

Because I moved with seeming confidence through the halls of the 
building, no one questioned me. Having no idea where his office was, I entered 
one corridor after another until I finally found the proper door. Several people 
were sitting on a bench, waiting. I joined them without a word. 

A few minutes passed, and then the door opened. Someone came out. 
Before the door closed, I stood up and walked inside. 

It was a big room, decorated in rich aristocratic fashion. The Vice- 
Governor was sitting alone at his desk. 

He was clearly surprised to receive a visitor without prior notification. 

"How can I help you, sir?" Perhaps because I was a foreigner his tone was 
respectful. 

"I am sorry to disturb you." I said softly. "I am a Margi seeking permission 
to visit my Guru, Shri P.R. Sarkar, who is presently in Bankipur Jail." 

He started shaking slightly. 

"You should follow the normal channels with the prison authorities," he 
said. 

"I have already exhausted those. That's why I came to you." 

"Only the Governor himself can deal with your case. He's in Delhi, so you 
can contact him there, please. Thank you, and good bye." 

"In this situation, sir," I said, "it is you that should call him. Besides, I have 
information indicating that you have full power in his absence to take such 
minor decisions." 

"I cannot tolerate your indiscretions," he said, trembling a bit more. "I 
absolutely will not make any such decision on your behalf. So please leave." He 
pushed twice or thrice a button on his desk. 

"Sir, I remind you of the law of karma," I said. "For every action there is a 
resulting reaction. So you should be very careful in your dealings regarding 
Shri Sarkar."

Now he was shaking with abandon. "Get out! Get out!" Though he pushed 
repeatedly on the button, no one disturbed our pleasant conversation. 

"Are you familiar, sir, with Ananda Marga's philosophy and dynamic social 
work? I think not, and I believe they demand your attention." 

By now he was unable to think rationally. Rather, he was sweating, 
shivering and madly swatting the button. 

The door opened with a bang. Two men rushed in. 

"Grab him! Grab him!" the Vice-Governor yelled. 

I was standing still, but they jumped on me like I was wild coyote, each 
one grasping an arm of my dangerous body. 

"Take him out! Take him away!" 

In a few minutes the three of us arrived at the nearby police station. I sat 
down while my two captors talked with the police for a minute and then left. 

"You're under arrest," a policeman said. 

"What's the charge?" 

They talked between themselves. Then the same man, clearly the officer in¬ 
charge said, "We don't know." 

"Well, if you can't tell me, then I'll just be leaving." I stood up. "No, please, 

sir. Wait. We shortly find out charge." One man went out the door. 

After ten minutes he came back, saying, "You charged with attacking Vice- 
Governor. " 

"That's unmitigated poppycock." I know that Indians who are uneducated 
bow their heads to such language. "I didn't even touch him. I'm going." I 
moved toward the door. 

"Wait, please wait, sir!" Again the man ran out. 

On returning, he said, "Vice-Governor changed charge to threatening 
attack." 

"Tommyrot and claptrap," I said. "I was merely discussing philosophy with 
him. I can't waste any more time here." Again I started to leave. 

"Wait, sir! Just a minute, please!" They 

talked among themselves. 



Personal contact

The officer in-charge gave me a feeble smile. "Charges dropped, sir. Please 
no mention anyone." 

Just after returning to our Central Office, I ran into three Margi brothers on 
their way for a visit with Baba. Without mentioning what had just happened to 
me, I asked them to please pass my namaskar 39 to Him. 

Later, coming out of the jail, they told me their story. 

They took the trouble to express my regards to Baba, and on doing so, Baba 
Himself namaskared with His hands, and then said, 

"Hmm. Dharmapala... Just see, just see. Though my boys and my girls are 
not yet perfectly following 16 Points, the immoralists are afraid of them, and 
literally shake in fear. 40 

"But when my boys and my girls really adhere to 76 Points" He continued, 
"the bones of the immoralists will shake. You understand?" 

He jabbed at His own thigh, smiling broadly, saying, "The very bone will 
shake." 

Samadhi or not? 

Having gone to all possible lengths to gain permission from the authorities 
to meet Baba, I set upon a new plan, a violent one. This time I was determined 
that nothing would stop me. 

Taking permission from the guards, I entered the office of the prison 
warden. I was well known to him due to my numerous attempts in the past to 
gain permission. He politely invited me to be seated. One other man was also 
sitting there. 

"I want to tell you, sir," I said, "that this week I met the Vice-Gover-nor, 
and he also refused my request to meet Baba. So I've decided that if your 
response to my last-ditch request is negative, then I shall physically thrust you 
people aside and enter His cell by brute force." I knew that Baba's cell was only 
a few meters away, and that no locked door stood in-between. Out of respect 
they never locked the door of His cell. 

"Sir, sir, you must not think such things. You know I am deeply sorry that I 
cannot allow you to enter. I would lose my job. I, too, am a devotee of Baba, so 
please believe me about my limitations." 

39 Namaskar is a hand gesture which means" I respect the divinity within you with my mind and 
heart". 

40 16 Points is a summary of the most important practices suggested for all M argis.

"How can you say you're devoted to Baba? If it were so, then you wouldn't 
be afraid to take such a minor risk. You know my heart is breaking to see 
Him." 

"We here know all too well about Baba's power and omniscience. But I am 
helpless due to my duty." 

"This is just a load of nonsense. I am going to break through now." I started 
to get up. 

"Wait! You don't understand our realization of Baba." He turned to the 
other man. "Doctor, please tell this gentleman about the experience you had the 
other day." 

The doctor cleared his throat. "Usually, I attend Baba every morning at 
11:00. But three days ago I was busy all morning and had to delay my visit 
until 3:00 in the afternoon. When I approached the cell, I got a shock. Baba was 
sitting in meditation, but He was not sitting on the cot. He was floating about 
three feet above it! I couldn't believe my eyes. All my thoughts disappeared, 
and I stood there, simply staring at him. How much time passed I don't know. 
But I slowly became aware that His face was changing. He had become Lord 
Shiva! Trembling with fear, I ran back to this office." 

"I can attest that he was shaking like a leaf when he dashed in here that 
day," said the warden. "I thought he was having an epileptic fit." 

"Well, I don't care for your explanations or your experiences," I said. "If 
you won't give me permission to enter Baba's room, then I shall proceed there 
in my own way." 

lust as I started to rise again, a third man entered the room. The warden 
turned to me, saying, "Please! Wait at least a moment while I speak to this 
officer." 

While the warden was occupied, I closed my eyes. Without the slightest 
effort I dropped into deep meditation. Losing awareness of surroundings, I saw 
Baba smiling sweetly. He was holding me in His lap. Stroking my head 
repeatedly, He said, "My dear Dharmapala. There is a very good reason why I 
am not allowing you to meet Me ... a very good reason." 

I became lost in His smile... His voice... the feeling of His soft hand. The next 
thing I knew, I heard a voice saying, "He's in samadhi ." I thought, "Who is 
that? And who is he talking about?" Gradually I remembered where I was. Ah, 
it's the warden speaking ... speaking about me, I thought. 



Personal contact 


136 


I parted my lips, thinking I would say, "No, I'm not in samadhi" But instead 
of these words, only incoherent mumbles issued from my mouth. I opened my 
eyes, and tears fell out. 

"Wait until you come into normal mood," the warden said softly. He 
looked at me with a new gentleness. 

A few moments passed while the warden was speaking to the third man. I 
stood up, and all three of them clearly became apprehensive— on their guard as 
to what I would do. 

"Please reconsider..." the warden started saying to me. 

I cut him off by doing namaskar with my hands, and said in a breaking, 
feathery voice, "It's...alright...now." 

Almost simultaneously, all three of them dropped their jaws in surprise. 
They were speechless as I walked out of the office into the outer courtyard. 

There in the sunlight stood Baba's personal assistant together with another 
Dada. They knew of my intention to somehow get into Baba's cell today. On 
seeing my shining, tearful face, they exclaimed, "You've seen Baba!" 

I didn't know whether to say "yes" or "no." 

Transcending drugs 

Huskvarna, Sweden. Our first three residents moved into our new 
rehabilitation project today. They are all drug addicts. The city government has 
given us a free lease on the building with an understanding that we would 
establish a halfway-house for drug addicts. 

We only accept young men who demonstrate an interest to improve 
themselves. In that case, it is not overly difficult to cure them. Our staff joins 
them in practicing meditation to gain inspiration and will-power, vegetarianism 
and fasting to eliminate body toxins, yoga postures to balance the hormones, 
and social work to provide a sense of personal value. The system appears 
sound, but the most important ingredient is loving care. Enforcing external 
discipline has little worth in itself. 

A few years ago one of our workers first demonstrated this process by 
curing some heroin-addicts in Berlin. 

Playing with danger — an unsolved riddle 

This is my first visit to Bergen, Norway. Last night I stayed in the flat of a 
brother named Trond, a friend of a friend. He turned out to be 



137 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


a bit 'different'. It was late when I arrived and he was keen to go to bed, so he 
showed me a couch where I could sleep. Since I never sleep on a soft bed, I 
instead arranged my blankets on the floor in the comer of his bedroom. 

I was sleeping deeply with a cover pulled over my head when something 
woke me up. 

What is this ? I thought. I felt a pressure on my leg, but could not identify 
its source. Instantly I regained full alertness. Now I was both curious and 
anxious. 

The pressure was relieved, only to be felt again a moment later on my 
waist. 

The oddest thing! I thought. Is it that fellow up to no good? Then, the 
pressure still against my waist, a second unstable pressure came directly on top 
of my body. 

There's no mistaking it—surely it's a person. At first he was walking 
around me, and now he's walking on top of me! Whoever it was must not have 
been expecting anybody to be lying on the floor. 

Though it may be my host simply sleep-walking, I thought, it's more likely a 
thief moving in the dark. He took another step, this time on my shoulder. I lay 
there, unmoving, and thought out a quick plan. 

Now! I thought, my heartbeat quickening. Quick as a flash, I sat up. 
simultaneously thrusting the blanket off. 

"Uhh!" he exclaimed, clearly shocked that he had been walking on a 
person. He bucked off of me. I saw his eyes widen in fright as he ran toward 
the door. Without losing a second, I grabbed my pocket knife from my nearby 
shoulder bag and dashed after him into the adjacent room. 

Our scuffle created quite a noise. My host sat up in his bed. "Hey! What's 
this? What're you doing?" 

Instead of replying, I shouted to the thief in the most threatening tone I 
could muster, "Come out! I know you're here!" I couldn't see anyone in the 
darkness. 

"What?" Trond yelled. "Who is it?" 

I turned on the light and looked all around. Nobody. But there were only 
the two rooms. And there was no way he could have gone out the door of the 
flat. 



Personal contact 


138 


"It's a thief, or something!" I said to Trond who was still sitting in bed. 

Holding the knife tightly in my fist, I threw aside the curtains, the chairs, 
tables, everything the thief might use for cover. Nothing. Nobody. 

I was dumbfounded. By now Trond had come into the room. I told him in 
detail what had happened. 

"Do you have any explanation?" I said. 

"No. It's pretty strange. Maybe you imagined it all." 

"Impossible. After feeling his first step, I was wide awake." 

"Odd..." 

"What? Did you ever experience something like this before?" "No, no. 

Surely not." 

With nothing further to speak about, we awkwardly went back to our 
respective sleeping places. A few minutes passed. 

"Ah, Dada," he said softly. "In fact something out of the ordinary did 
happen to me a few nights ago." 

"Tell me." 

"I was fast asleep when I was awakened by someone pressing my body in 
different places. I threw my blanket off, and saw someone jump away and run 
into the other room." 

"But that's exactly what happened to me!" 

"Well...I...I don't know..." 

"What do you think it was?" 

"No, no, no..." 

"What?" 

"No. Nothing to speak about. Let's go to sleep." He 

refused to talk any more. 

This morning, while I was doing meditation, Trond left the house. 

After meditation I walked into the second room and looked around. Middle- 
class conservative furniture...a small orderly collection of books...a few slightly 
gaudy decorative items...and—wait a moment—I looked at the titles of his 
books: History of the Occult, Science of Magic, Psychic Power Unleashed, 
Hitler and the Spear of Destiny, Dictionary of Necromancy, and many more 
titles referring to the black arts. What kind of a person...? 



139 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Surely the fellow was dabbling in occult power. That might explain last 
night's phenomena. The being who walked on me last night was not human, not 
even physical. That's why he could disappear when I chased him. 

It seems my host may have developed some psychic power, though it's 
clear he was not in control of that power. He, too, was affected by it. On one 
hand he didn't want to talk about it, but on the other hand he wanted help. 

Because he did not confide in me, however, and because I have to leave 
today, it will have to remain an unsolved riddle—at least for now. I could help 
him, but only if he asks. 

Unfortunately there must be countless other people like him, playing with 
dangerous powers, hardly knowing what they are doing, learning a few spells 
and concentration techniques and materializing latent forces from their 
subconscious minds before they have the morality, purity and mental strength 
to control themselves. What to do? Nothing, except to continue to develop 
spiritual and social qualities. At the proper time society will need and demand 
the expression of such God-centered qualities. 

Within or without? 

Stockholm. After walking alone this afternoon up a small hill rising above 
the buildings and highways of the city, I sat in a natural boulder garden. 
Surrounded by urban chaos, this site offered itself as a Tantric oasis. Inspired, I 
resolved not to budge a muscle during meditation. 

About half an hour later, it began to drizzle. 

A test, I thought. / shall not move. 

The rain grew stronger, until it became a heavy downpour. 

I can change my clothes anytime, I thought, but not my mind. 

It lasted five or ten minutes, then stopped completely. Again I became 
aware of the distant sound of cars creating their usual but eerie cosmic wind 
tunnel effect in my brain. Otherwise the only other sound was the mournful 
crowing of nearby birds. 

My concentration increased until I was no longer conscious of my wetness. 

After some time a new, high pitched sound appeared far away, perhaps a 
kilometer or so. Was it a dog barking faintly? Then a little

louder—yes, a dog. Somehow that dog seemed to have something to do with 
me from the moment I heard it. The barking became still louder. I supposed it 
was coming toward me. 

Even if it attacks me, I won't stir. 

Closer and closer the unfriendly bark came. Why? I could not guess. Then 
it was on my hill, yelping. 

He is going to attack. I don't care. It's a test. If I'm hurt or killed, it's Your 
problem. Baba. 

The dog was now almost on me. His barking was so loud and vicious that it 
hurt my eardrums. He was so near to my face that I could feel the heat of his 
breath, and its stink also. I sat bolt upright, unmov-ing. My mind flickered back 
and forth between the thought of my meditation and that of the dog. 

A few seconds later, the noise ceased. A pause. Then I heard his feet, as he 
turned and walked away from me. 

Not allowing myself to wonder how or why it happened, my concentration 
dived inward. I enjoyed the rest of meditation. 

When I opened my eyes I looked at my watch. One hour and twenty 
minutes. I started to rise to my feet, and, what? How could it be? There wasn't a 
drop of rainwater to be seen. Everything was bone dry, including my clothing. 

Could it be the rain was a figment of my imagination? And the dog also? 

I laughed and walked down the hill. 

Orebro, Sweden. Every time I receive a circular, a letter, or, like today, a 
phone call with news from India, I experience the same feelings. First my heart 
flutters with hope for a positive verdict, then a sinking feeling comes when I 
find out that there's been no real progress. Then the agony of longing for Him 
increases until it becomes a sharp pain in my heart, my face gets hot and a few 
sighs escape. Finally, I tell myself that there's nothing to worry about, that He 
knows exactly what He's doing, and that it's all just a drama with so many ups 
and downs that it only seems like it will never finish, yet it will in fact one day 
surely come to a happy ending. Then I mentally prostrate to Him, leave 
everything to Him, and grimly turn back to His work. After a few minutes I'm 
back to normal, encouraging others, smiling and working with as much zeal as 
I can muster.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Unknown to everyone, my normality also includes a constant dull pressure 
at the back of my skull and in the core of my heart where I bury my yearning to 
see Him. 

Work while working, meditate while meditating 

Stockholm. 1978. A few days ago, Dada Krtashivananda arrived from 
India, full of news. Subconsciously I prepared myself to go through my usual 
sequence of hope, disappointment and frustration. This time I never made it 
past hope. Baba's case is on a steadily rising list of cases to be heard by the 
court. Something concrete should happen anytime soon. Even as I write this I 
still feel that nervous flutter of anticipation in my heart. 

He was also full of stories. I'll mention two of them. 

The first happened many years ago during a meeting with the margiis: 

BABA: Do you all want to hear the Cosmic Sound? 

MARGIIS (about twenty): Yes, yes, Baba! 

BABA: Do deep meditation now. (After a few minutes silence Baba asked 
one Margii) What did you hear? 

MARGII: I heard the sound of the A um, Baba. 

BABA (pointing to others): And you ... and you? 

OTHER MARGIIS: Yes, Baba ... and I... and I... 

(One by one, each Margii says he or she heard the cosmic sound A um.) 

BABA (pointing to Krtashivanandaji): And what about you, little boy? 

KRTASHIVANANDA: I'm sorry, Baba, I didn't hear anything special. 

BABA: Yes. Now you alone, do dhyana (higher meditation). (After a 
minute) Well, then? 

KRTASHIVANANDA: I'm sorry. Baba. I still could not hear anything. 

BABA: I told you to do dhyana. Instead, you are thinking of your 
missionary work. When doing meditation you should not think of work. Now 
do meditation again. (After another minute) Hmmm? 

KRTASHIVANANDA: Yes, Baba. At last I heard the Aum. 

BABA: Just see. Just see. 



Personal contact 


142 


The other story began with a meeting in which Baba assured all the workers 
that He would never allow any of them to starve. He promised they would 
receive at least one meal daily. So, no need to worry. 

Krtashivanandaji wanted to secretly test Baba. During a walking journey 
which took seven days, he maintained silence. He neither carried any food, nor 
asked anyone. Once each day, however, a different stranger approached him and 
asked if he needed food. He accepted without saying anything. This happened 
every day except once—fasting day. 

June. Some real news today: Baba's case has started. The prosecution is 
presenting its evidence now. Of course, the defense's arguments will follow. 

I can hardly stop thinking about Baba. My mind rolls uncontrollably 
between states of expectation, anxiety, awe (of His cosmic strategy), a desperate 
craving to see Him, and, occasionally, little flashes of fear. 

It's Baba's problem 

I called my higher authority today and told him, "Dada, ten of the eleven full- 
timers in my region want to go for acharya training." "Very good." 

"So I am planning to send all of them to acharya training this week." "All 

of them?" "Yes. Why not?" 

"Are you crazy? If you empty your region of full-timers, all of the work will 
collapse. Just send two for now. Then perhaps each month you can send 
another." 

"Look, if Baba wants to help, there's an local full-timer training session 
coming up in July. Besides, I thought our most important work is wholetimer 
creation." 

"That's right but..." 

"And if I delay in sending some of them, they may lose their inspiration." 

"Don't be a fool." 

"If any problem comes to the region, it's Baba's problem. He has to take 
care. I am sending all these brothers and sisters for Him." 



143 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"You idiot! I won't permit you to send them all at once." 

"Dada, excuse me for asking, but is that your suggestion or is that your 
order?" I asked. 

"Well, of course it is not my order. But you're absolutely not to do it. Do 
you understand?" 

"Yes." 

I knew that he couldn't give such an order because creating new 
wholetimers is our first priority. In this case, I am technically free to make my 
own decision. Certainly he is right from the standpoint of normal logic. Perhaps 
I am a fool, but it will be a fine Tantric test for Baba to take care of His own 
work. I'll send them all to the Sweden acharya training center as quickly as 
possible. 


July. News from Patna: The defense has started presenting their arguments. 

Only You know. Baba, what will happen, what You've planned. But I'm 
sure part of Your plan is to make me mad for You. 

Timmern, Germany. The only full-timer left in my region is Dhruvadev, 
who doesn't want to become an acharya. As expected, my higher authority was 
furious. Baba, You have to help. 

Today, the new Berlin Sector full-timer training session started here. I am 
the trainer together with another Dada. It's a one-month program, and the 
biggest we've ever held. Ninety Margiis are attending. Thirty of them are from 
Scandinavia. Of course, most of the trainees are only here for the experience. 
Let's see how many He inspires to become real full-timers. 

Free at last! 

Today's news!!!! What news!!!! It's the happiest day of my life!!!! Baba is 
released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

After seven years of imprisonment and over five years of fasting, He is 
vindicated, absolved of guilt. 

The true criminal is Indira Gandhi's administration. By using deceit, 
bribery, corruption, intimidation, torture, defamation—what to speak of a total 
ban against Ananda Marga and imprisonment of all Margiis and workers—Mrs 
Gandhi and her cohorts have tried their best

to finish off Baba and Ananda Marga but they have failed miserably. History 
will document all the steps that the forces of Nature will take against the real 
sinners. We need do nothing against them, nor can we hate them. Though they 
are full of negativity, they too are unwitting tools of God's play. 

My beautiful Baba. I still have not physically seen Him. They say He's 
withered, emaciated—maintained only by His psycho-spiritual power. Now His 
fast will finish, and He will surely regain His robust constitution. Clouds cannot 
long overcast the sun. 

And I will see Him at last!!! Like Him, I have also waited these seven years. 

(Yes, I'll go to India. But first I have to finish the local full-timer training 
session which is going perfectly.) 

Guidance from afar 

Timmern. 8 August. I've been tortured by asthma for many nights. Deep 
within. I don't mind. It's an interesting test. But it's my duty to try to cure it. so I 
have experimented with many remedies. Yesterday I even began a cure 
recommended by our local Margii doctor Sukumar in which I must twice daily 
cleanse my intestines by drinking my urine. I did it yesterday but found it so 
repulsive that I discontinued it today. Baba Himself would have to instruct me 
to undergo this treatment before I would take it up again. 

Ten days later. A circular arrived from India, highlighting many new points 
given by Baba. For me, the most interesting one is that He criticizes Indian 
Prime Minister Moraji Desai's daily health-habit of drinking his own urine. 
Desai often openly declares its curative value. Baba, however, says urine is the 
most crude substance one can ingest. 

The circular is dated 9 August. This means He directly caught my thought, 
"Baba You have to personally instruct me if You want me to resume this cure." 
But instead of telling me to resume it. He forbid it. 

Of course there's no way that news of my experiment could have been 
conveyed to Calcutta. 

[Author's note: About two years later, I had an experience which 
paralleled the above one. It also happened in Germany:

Travels with the Mystic Master 


"About two weeks ago the Dadas and Didis came from all over the 
sector for RDS. To break the tension one evening, a few of us went to a movie. 
Once there, it was certainly our duty to maximally enjoy ourselves, and 
eliminate the greatest possible tension. Accordingly, we laughed our heads off. 

Little did we know that the local district secretary of Ananda Marga 
was also present in the same theater. The next day he complained to our higher 
authority that 'The Dadas' behavior was unsuitable for acharyas.' 

Today a circular came from India with a few new conduct rules from 
Baba, including: 'Acharyas must not go to public movie theaters.' 

Without going into details. I'm one hundred percent sure that no one 
reported our pleasurable evening at the movies to India. Considering that the 
circular was dated the day afterwards, I believe this is yet another instance of 
Baba's sticking His adorably ethereal nose into our personal lives. Having an 
all-knowing guru has both its advantages and disadvantages."! 

Full-timer training ended today. Congratulations. Baba! You inspired ten of 
the thirty trainees from Scandinavia to become full-tim-ers-exactly filling the 
gap created when the previous ones left to becoming acharyas. 

Another perfect work by the Mystic Sculptor. 

Ten for ten! His blessing is clear: He likes, no. He loves this kind of noble 
risk. 

Before leaving for India, I will place all the new full-timers in the field. 

Yes: my flight is booked for India, and this time I will see You. Nothing 
can stop our meeting now....Unless You play some last minute nasty trick. 
Don't You dare do that. Baba! Not this time, please. 

Having fun with a bad man 

Copenhagen. After we finished kiirtan and began group meditation this 
evening, I felt something evil in the air. Though I had never stood up during 
group meditation before, today I made an exception. I quietly walked into the 
front room which serves as our cooperative restaurant and community center. 
Mainjula was sitting there.

"Did anything strange happen just now, Mainjula?" I whispered. "No, 

Dada..." 

"Have you been completely alone?" 

"Well, a man came in. He looked around for a couple of minutes, and left 
just before you came in." "Who was he?" 

"I don't know his name. He was Indian and has been here a few times 
before. He has a mustache, and..." 

"I know," I interrupted. "I've seen him several times recently. He's thin, has 
a sharp chin, and beady eyes which he shifts around as he speaks. He expresses 
an exaggerated interest in meditation and yoga though he's never tried to learn." 

"Yeah, that's him." 

"What was he doing just now?" 

"Nothing." 

"He must be a very bad man. His very vibration strongly disturbed my 
meditation. If you ever see him again, please tell me." 

Two days later. This morning I was so late for my Aeroflot flight to 
Moscow that the plane had to be delayed a few minutes only for me. Who 
could believe that I would be late for a flight that was taking me directly to 
Baba. But there was so much to take care of before I left. I had to be either 
responsible and late, or irresponsible and on-time. Does He always have to 
make such last minute dramas? 

Once they rushed me aboard, the stewardess escorted me directly to my 
seat. 

With all the hurry, I didn't notice the passenger sitting next to me until I had 
already put on my seat belt—it was the same Indian man who had disturbed my 
meditation two days ago. I was astonished, but immediately understood the 
connection. Surely he was a member of the CBI (Central Bureau of 
Investigation in India) with instructions to follow me. How could he be foolish 
enough to reserve a seat next to mine? 

D amn, I thought. Is this yet another of Baba's tricks to keep me from seeing 
Him? 

"Nice to see you again," he said with a derisive smirk on his face. 

"Where are you going?" I asked politely. 

"To Dethi, of course." 



147 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"What takes you to Delhi?" 

"To meet my family. And where are you going?" He was still wearing the 
same arrogant grin. Confident that I was also going to Delhi, he no longer had 
anything to hide—in contrast to these last days during which he had shadowed 
me in Copenhagen. 

"To Dacca," I said bluntly, staring at him. The look on his face abruptly 
turned to bewilderment when he realized that he had miscalculated. 

"And though I appreciate your recent concern for my security," I continued, 
"I can't figure out what you hope to find out from me. Nevertheless, you'll have 
to excuse me because my curiosity is less than my repulsion for this kind of 
game." 

I stood up and moved to another seat. Something tells me this man may 
soon lose his job. But it's not my duty to look after his security. 

Personal contact 

Calcutta. Oh, Lord, my heart pounded as I waited for You upstairs in the 
Jodhpur Park office. Would You be like my dreams? Would You smile as I'd 
imagined? How would You treat me? What would You say? They said You 
would come soon-now, what delays You? After waiting seven years, seven 
minutes was agony. 

Thirty workers lined up in the corridor. Some gossiped or hummed a tune. 
But not a sound could pass my lips; nothing could enter my mind except the 
thought of You; my heart wept, jumped, ached... 

“Parampita Baba ki jai! Victory to Baba!" Suddenly-there You were! 
Alive. Breathing. Walking towards me. Not a vision or a dream this time. You 
took over my eyes, my mind. Every muscle, every nerve leaned toward You as 
You moved down the silent row. Oh, God! That for which I was bom-fulfilled. 
If, in that moment I had died, and fallen at Your feet I would have been 
satisfied. 

You gave me a passing glance. You saw me. I was stunned. I didn't need 
that, but You gave it. Everything which follows in my life will be like toys for 
an infant already suckling its mother's breast. 

You walked into Your room. The door closed. I remained-a puppet with a 
head full of sawdust. 

Then excitement, voices echoing meajun A essly down the corridor, one 
sound pierced through the din: 'Those who have not yet had Per- 



personal Contact 


148 


sonal Contact, come here." I drifted toward Dada Ramananda, Baba's personal 
assistant. Only Indian workers and full-timers were around him. 

"What, you?" he said to me. "You haven't had Personal Contact yet?" 

"No, Dadaji." 

"All these years?" Without another word he turned sharply, opened Baba's 
door, and went in. 

Within seconds he reappeared, grabbed my shoulders, and shoved me 
through the door. "Go in!" I stumbled, and caught myself while the door shut 
behind me. 

I looked up. You sat alone on Your bed, smiling. I threw myself at Your 
feet, extending my arms until I was an arrow piercing the target. 

"Sit up, my boy." You spoke to me! Was I dreaming? Tears began to flow 
from my eyes. Oh, what would You say now? I had waited seven years—Baba! 

"What is your name, my boy?" What—was this a joke? You knew not only 
my name, but everything, everything about me, more than I knew about myself. 

I smiled and said. "Dharmapala, Baba." How silly. 

"And what is your posting?" 

Oh, come to the point. Baba, I thought. Talk to me personally, not like 
someone You never met! 

Again I smiled. "Regional Secretary of Stockholm and Oslo Regions, 
Baba." 

"Acha. You know you made some mistakes in your past." 

I smiled, saying, "Yes, Baba." Now, surely You would go into detail about 
my personal history. 

But no. It was not to be. A few minutes passed, some more words about 
correcting myself, about becoming a model for others. Threatened punishment 
with Your stick, the stick whistling through the air, and stopping just before 
touching me. An oath. Formalities—all formalities. 

Finished. Again I lay at Your feet, and then left. 

I had waited seven years for You to ask me my name and my posting? My 
heart sank. I am nothing special to Baba, I thought. The blood rushed to my 
head. Did I only imagine His greatness all these years? 



149 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Dumbfounded. I stood again outside Your door, but this time there was doubt. 
Doubt—ugly and dark. 

But I had little time to brood. Ramanandaji went inside Your room, then 
came out quickly and said, "Personal Contact is finished today. Get ready for 
darshan." 

Darshan-to see: a time when all were invited to see You, or be seen by You. 
We all rushed up to the roof. 

Already about 200 people were sitting there. Following no one's example, I 
moved to the front, and sat immediately in front of Your sofa. 

Why had You talked like that to me? I felt cheated. Okay my work has been 
for humanity. But it was also to please You. And You didn't care. I'm just 
another piece from Your toolbox. 

You came and sat down. We danced kiirtan in front of You. 

Still I'll try to please You. Baba. 

We danced, we sang, we sat down, and You began speaking. 

And then, what? You looked deep within me. Your eyes twinkled. Your lips 
turned in a smile, You put Your hand to my face. You gently pinched my 
cheek, saying, "Yes, yes. And what do you say, my little boy?" I was 
speechless, smiling back. You lightly slapped my face lovingly. 

Ecstasy! 

I am special to Him! He loves me! 

If my smile had been any bigger, my face would have broken. 

You went on talking. Glancing at me again and again. And again You 
pinched me and lightly slapped me. 

Though hundreds of others were there, we might as well have been alone. 
This time You were personal to the extreme. Oh, Baba! 

You left. Again I was baffled, but this time it was sweet chaos. Why do You 
play such games? Clearly You love me. But in the Personal Contact itself. You 
said nothing interesting, and did nothing memorable. Afterward, only afterward. 
You were so loving, beyond my imagination. Why? 

Slowly I began to understand. Personal Contact is spiritual. Purely spiritual. 
It doesn't matter what happens experientially. Experience is not spiritual, it is 
mental. You did what You wanted during the Personal Contact. It will have 
exactly the proper unique effect on me, unrelated to either understanding or 
misunderstanding. 



150 Travels with the Mystic Master 

And I know—You want me to tell others that Personal Contact is purely 
spiritual. Not to expect anything. You will do only what is necessary to deepen 
our consciousness, which is beyond any objective phenomena. My head spins. 
My samskaras rise up, dance, and accelerate to the speed of life. 

You—Tantra Gum—You care only for that spirituality. 

And You pinched me. You slapped me—why?—just to please me. You 
already did what You wanted—and then You did what I wanted. 

You clever One. I... love ... You. 41 

His magic stick 

It seems that all of history's great Tantrics had to undergo either great 
suffering or great austerities. Buddha lived as an ascetic and later fasted for 
forty days. Krishna was born in jail and persecuted throughout much of his life. 
Jesus embraced poverty, was tormented throughout the years of his missionary 
work, and underwent the harshest torture on the cross. 7000 years ago, the first 
known Tantric guru, Shiva, had the habit of thrashing his leading disciples with 
a burning stick. 

Baba is no different. After seven years in prison, a poisoning that would 
have killed anyone else, and more than five years of fasting. He has picked up 
the work of building His mission and running the organization as if He had 
merely gone out for a walk, and like Shiva He is a fierce disciplinarian. 

[Author note: Before I explain about today's reporting session with Baba, I 
want to write a little introductory material. Two or three years 

41 The diary refers to samskara. For every action there is a reaction. Until the reaction occurs, 
the unexpressed reaction awaits expression. This unexpressed reaction is termed samskara. 
Sooner or later it must be expressed. Every thought is also an action, and is like a seed sown in 
the mind, changing the mind from its original equilibrium. A reaction is needed to return to 
that equilibrium. When the mind's balance is disturbed, an opposite expression of an equivalent 
quantity of energy is thus required. If there is a delay in time," equivalent quantity’ 1 takes that 
into account, and often requires a greater suffering or pleasure in order to balance the original 
disturbance. It is something like interest accrued in a bank account over time. Due to psychic 
suppression or repression, a person may have difficulty expressing samskaras. One may have 
mental blocks or fear. This causes a slowing down of spiritual development. Such blocks are to 
some extent inevitable in every person because of our human weaknesses. Because the very 
presence of Baba caused a strong stir in everyone's mind, M argis and workers always 
experienced an increase in the speed of expression of their samskaras just after seeing Baba. 
This was especially true when one had personal contact.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


before I joined Ananda Marga, I began reading spiritual books. One of the first 
was the biography of Milarepa, the most famous Tantric in the history of Tibet. 
Milarepa's guru, Marpa, severely tested him even before giving him initiation. 
The guru alternated between ignoring him, treating him brutally, and making 
fun of him. Milarepa was ordered to build a house of stones. This back-breaking 
work took him many months. When he completed it, the guru ridiculed him, 
and told him to build it again in a different way and in a different spot. This 
happened six times. Besides treating Milarepa severely, the gum even pre¬ 
tended to be dmnk. Finally Milarepa's despair overcame him. Fie left his gum 
and went to another teacher. A few days later he realized his mistake, returned 
to his gum, begged forgiveness, and pleaded for the initiation. The gum replied, 
"If only you had built one more house, your ego would have shmnk to the 
proper size. You would have burned most of your karma. After initiation you 
would have achieved liberation within a short time. Now I am forced to give 
you initiation, but you will have to practice meditation and austerities for many 
years to get your self-realization." 

For the next years, Milarepa lived in below-freezing conditions without 
clothing, ate no food except nettle soup, and practiced long meditation in lonely 
mountain caves. During this time, his gum died. Milarepa persisted until he 
achieved his goal. Fie then gradually created a large school of disciples. In his 
later life, though he underwent painful diseases which were said to be beyond 
the endurance of normal human beings, he was always in a blissful mood. 

From that young age I understood the spiritual path gradually demands 
greater and greater commitment. The goal is reached only if one is prepared to 
sacrifice everything for God. 

Tantric scriptures specify that a hue gum's relationship with a disciple must 
swing according to need from strictness and strong punishment to intimacy and 
affection. 

There are similarities to this concept in many traditions having elements of 
Tantra. Both Chinese and Japanese Zen owe their origins directly to Tantra. 
One of the most renown Zen masters. Linji Yixuan (in Japanese: Rinzai), who 
lived in the 9th century, was famous for using anger to awaken his disciples. He 
said, "Sometimes a shout is like the precious sword of the Diamond King; 
sometimes a shout is 



Personal Contact 


152 


like a golden-haired lion that creeps forward in a crouch; sometimes a shout is 
like a lure stick with a tuft of grass dangling on the end; sometimes a shout is 
not used as a shout at all." 

Ekido was a particularly severe teacher. His pupils feared him. One of them 
on duty, striking the gong to tell the time of day. missed his beats when his eye 
was attracted by a beautiful girl passing the temple gate. At that moment Ekido, 
who was directly behind him, hit him with a stick and the shock happened to 
kill him. Ekido's attitude remained absolutely unchanged by this incident. After 
this took place, he was able to produce under his guidance more than ten 
enlightened successors, a very unusual number. 

Of course, I do not condone such a killing, and rather consider that it may 
have been due to Ekido's carelessness. I simply mention it to demonstrate that 
harshness from the side of the teacher is a normal technique, and does not 
necessarily indicate a loss of control. As far as I know. Baba's punishments 
never produced any permanent harm. 

Yet another example concerns the master Inzan, who showed no distinction 
to his disciple Gisho on account of her sex. He scolded her like a thunderstorm. 
He cuffed her to awaken her inner nature. After her enlightenment, Inzan wrote 
a poem in her honor: 

This nun studied thirteen years under my guidance. 

In the evening she considered the deepest koans. 

In the morning she was wrapped in other koans. 

The Chinese nun Tetsuma surpassed all before her. 

And since Mujaku none has been so genuine as this Gisho! 

Yet there are many more gates for her to pass through. 

She should receive still more blows from my iron fist. 

Now I turn back to Baba. There are many stories about His reporting 
sessions, the countless displays of His spiritual power and love, and the 
punishment He metes out to His workers. A reporting session with Baba is 
always something extraordinary. For those who never experienced it, no words 
can adequately describe it. From the organizational standpoint, it serves as an 
occasion for Baba to examine our work output, and give guidance for 
improvements. More significantly, it is a time for us to be close to our guru, 
and for Him to stir into our hearts 



153 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


whatever spiritual ingredients we need. Part of His method for doing this 
involves stimulating different emotions in us, like shame, fear, love, anger, 
anxiety and compassion. His techniques for doing this change constantly and 
continuously. All of our work targets are difficult and often impossible, thus 
giving Baba plenty of opportunity to isolate the real causes for our failures. 
And those causes are always psychic weaknesses. In one way or another, by 
subtle indirect methods, He brings out these weaknesses, and then helps us to 
overcome them. 

I want to add something more still about Baba's incomparable ability to 
alternatively love and scold us. For this purpose I take the liberty to quote from 
an article by Dada Sarveshvarananda, a previous General Secretary. He writes: 

Baba was as strong as thunder in dealing with evil or immoral actions on 
the one hand, and as tender as a flower bud in dealing with righteous or moral 
actions on the other. Actually, I never felt Baba's anger was in any sense like 
that of an ordinary person. Usually if someone loses his temper, his blood 
pressure rises, his face turns red and he loses all mental equilibrium. But Baba 
was always in control of Himself. He would show anger and displeasure to 
make us realize our faults and goad us on towards inner and outer perfection. I 
always felt that He was playing a role with His anger for us because, in the 
next moment. He could be light-hearted again — laughing and making us 
laugh.... Truly, we were not so unnerved by His anger as one might expect. 
Even though that anger blew through us like a devastating storm, we knew that 
soothing rainfall was sure to follow. The severity of the prolonged reproofs and 
condemnation we had to face during our reporting sessions, pierced through 
our minds like arrows and made us completely heartbroken. We would then be 
hopelessly rejected. But when the reporting was over, He would change 
completely. He would call us and shower loving caresses and sweet, calming 
words on us. This love, this affection, was so sublime and touching that all the 
humiliation, dejection and agonies we were experiencing a moment before 
were instantly gone. ... Baba once said to me, "No matter how high a position a 
person attains, he or she will always need a strict guardian to answer to for his 
or her deeds — good or bad — who will give him or her proper guidance in 
life's journey. That guardian will 



Personal Contact 


154 


also be a perennial source of inspiration. That is why I have a responsibility to 
be very strict in my discipline and duties. But it is not my real nature. My 
responsibilty compels me, against my wish, to be harsh with you." Infinite 
affection was His real nature. What we saw in the way of anger and fury was 
nothing but a camouflage to an inner ocean of love and affection for all.... 

Further, here's a story of Dada Tapeshvarananda: 

In 1984 I was a Central worker. During a few days that the General 
Secretary was absent, I had the duty to give most of the reports to Baba. In the 
collective sessions. Baba gave me terrible punishment, as if the whole blame of 
the organization's defects was mine. 

After one punishment I felt so wounded, both physically and mentally, that I 
wanted to distance myself from Him. I decided I would-not sing Prabhat 
Samgiit, and that I would do only organizational work, since that was all He 
seemed to care about. 

So that night when Baba returned from fieldwalk, I intentionally avoided 
Him. and was not there for singing together with everyone else. I heard that 
Baba asked, "Where is Tapeshvarananda?" 

Someone answered, "Baba, he was just here, but maybe he is busy 
somewhere." 

After eating His dinner. He called me. I could not avoid, and had to go to 
His room. I did not look at Baba, and kept my eyes down while I answered His 
questions. 

He asked, "How did you like that song I gave yesterday, Tumi amar 
dhyaner dhyeyol Did you learn it?" I was silent. 

"You cannot remember?" 

"No, Baba, I did not learn it." 

"Whatever you remember, even one or two lines, you sing." Then I could not 
control my tears, and started crying. I said, "Baba, I did not learn the song, I 
cannot remember any line." "Why?" I could not reply. 

He said. "You see, I understand, you may feel that I only punish you. I only 
torture you. But you don't understand that when I am punishing you. my inner 
intention is not to torture you. but to purify you. You may feel externally that it 
is torture, that it is humiliation. But spiritual purification comes after suffering, 
torture and humiliation. 



155 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"The main enemy on the spiritual path is ego, and ego can be powedered 
only through these three processes of suffering, torture and humiliation. You 
may feel bad, but you don't know how happy I am when I see that you are 
successfully passing all these sufferings and tortures, because bliss and the 
supreme Ananda comes only after that. Ultimately in the spiritual world, 
nothing is suffering. There is only you moving toward the spiritual bliss. 

"Do you know why I asked you about that song? The last line says, 'I am 
weeping. Is that what You want? If that gives You pleasure, then I will go on 
weeping only for You."' 

So after this big build-up about Baba's stricness, let's turn to what really 
happened today:J 

I had heard stories about reporting sessions before Baba, the punishment 
He metes out to his workers and the countless displays of His spiritual power 
and love; today I had my first real taste during a session with the education 
department. 

The drama went as follows: 

GENERAL SECRETARY [GS]: How many schools were started last month 
in your region? 

RANCHI REGIONAL SECRETARY. Three, Dada. 

BABA: Why only three? How many of your diocese secretaries are present 
here? 

REG. SECY.: Four, Baba. 

BABA (frowning and squinting): Then why not four schools? Nonsense, 
rascal. Who is the worker that didn't start a school? 

DIOCESE SECRETARY (stepping forward uneasily): Myself, Baba. 

BABA: Is there any justification for such gross inefficiency? 

DIO. SECY, (stammering): I try...tried my my best. Baba. 

BABA: Tried! Stupid. One does or does not do. To sincerely try is to do. 
So no need to keep the word try in your dictionary. Ranchi regional secretary, 
come forward! (The reg. secy, steps in front of Baba.) Due to your inadequate 
supervision, this jewel-of-a-boy's potentiality was not fully utilized. Hands up! 
(The reg. secy, lifts both arms straight up.) Animal! Only eating and sleeping! 
(Baba hits His stick against his side. The reg. secy, jumps up involuntarily.) 
Wasting your time and 



Personal Contact 


156 


misguiding your workers.(Baba beats a him bit more, as the reg. secy, mutters 
"Baba Baba" and leaps from side to side.) 

DIO. SECY, (moving closer to Baba): No, don't beat him, Baba! It's my 
fault. 

BABA (pausing with the stick and speaking in a calm, dignified manner): 
No. it's not your fault. It is due to your supervisor. (He turns to the reg. secy, 
and strikes him again.) Idiot, lazy fellow! 

REG. SECY, (speaking to the dio. secy.): Say something concrete! 

DIO. SECY.: Baba, I'll start a school within one month. 

BABA (hits the reg. secy, again): One month! One month! Do you think 
that the suffering humanity can wait for such listlessness and lethargy? 

DIO. SECY.: One week. Baba! I'll start the school within one week! BABA 
(halting with the stick): Did you hear what the boy said, GS? GENERAL 
SECY: Yes, Baba. He said he will start a school in one week. 

BABA (taking out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from His brow): Yes, 
take a note. If a school is not started within one week, then further measures 
will be required. 

REG. SECY.: Baba, I will properly supervise him. 

BABA: Yesss... 

Surely most people would be horrified to see such a display of anger and 
force. But I was full of inspiration. Here was a man-making guru, capable of 
molding His disciples for the benefit of society. 

After leaving the room, the RS joked and laughed, his face suffused with 
joy, though the marks of the stick were still visible. It made me even more 
curious to know the inner effect of His stick. 

Later I got a chance to ask one senior worker how everyone tolerated 
Baba's abuse. He said. "We know from Tantra's long tradition that the guru has 
the responsibility to uplift his disciple from animal-life to warrior-life to divine- 
life. To achieve this, the guru's behavior will have to fluctuate between 
extremely bitter and extremely sweet. And it varies for each disciple. 

"More importantly. Baba instructed us how to deal with subordinate 
workers. He said that for every ten parts of strictness we use, we must give at 
least eleven parts of love. In His case I feel like all the 



157 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


strictness He employs cannot compare with His boundless love. Baba's 
existence is only for us. He does nothing for Himself. It doesn't matter if 
someone else believes I'm right or wrong about Baba, because that's my daily 
experience. That's why no amount of severe punishment can shake my 
relationship with Him." 

After the Dada left I remembered a story I had heard about Swami 
Shivananda. One of his disciples once asked him a question, "Guruji, your 
teaching is beautiful for all of us who are practicing yoga and meditation. Your 
mission also benefits thousands of sick people who come to our medical 
clinics. But what about the rest of the human society, the millions and billions 
who suffer from poverty, ignorance and injustice? Can you not do something 
for them? Can you not please guide us to help the entire society?" 

Shivanandaji answered, "We must only help the rest of suffering humanity 
indirectly. To serve them directly would require a vast organization which 
would crumble under its own weight. My workers would quarrel with each 
other and destroy whatever was created. No, I am not the man to do that work." 

I believe that Baba's greatest contribution to history is the creation of a 
Tantric organization to serve the entire human society, an organization based 
on renunciate workers. Because renunciates prefer to live outside of normal 
social disciplines, the subtlest psychology is required in training us. More 
importantly, we have to overcome our petty differences. We have to move 
together as one great family. For this purpose. Baba belittles our egos by 
chastising us, and encourages our souls to unfold by loving us. 

Awakening latent qualities 

I did not have to wait long for my own personal experience. Today I, too, felt 
the touch of His stick. BABA: What is your post? 

ME: Regional Secretary, Stockholm and Oslo Regions, Baba. 

BABA: How many new kindergartens or primary schools did you open in 
the last one month? 

ME (feeling very proud): Two kindergartens. Baba. 

BABA: And in that same period how many permanent welfare centers did 
you start? 



Personal Contact 


158 


ME: Ah, none. Baba. 

BABA: Do you think the number is adequate? ME: 

No, Baba. 

BABA: Are you proud of your work? ME: 

No, Baba. 

BABA: Should we all praise you? ME: No, 

Baba. You should punish me. 

BABA: Yes, you deserve punishment. Hands up! (I raise my hands. Baba 
strikes me on my right side. I am surprised by the intensity of the pain and 
jump slightly.) Are you properly utilizing your time as a worker? 

ME: No, Baba. (As He goes on hitting, I involuntarily think. Baba loves 
me. He is doing this only because He cares for me. Both my mind and body 
settle down as I look into His eyes. Instead of reflecting anger, those eyes are 
compassionate.) I will do better, Baba, much better. 

BABA: What does he say, GS? 

GENERAL SECRETARY: He says he will do much better. Baba. BABA 
(switching over to hitting me on my left side): This reply is not sufficient. 

ME (Though the pain is real, I feel my mind diving deeper into Him.): I 
shall work every second of every minute, Baba. (More blows) I will not think 
for my own petty self. I will become an ideal man. 

BABA (turning the edges of His mouth upward, His cheeks dimpling): GS, 
he does want to be a good boy. Yes. (Waving His stick toward the side of the 
room) Go, stand there on the side. 

I went and joined the Dadas who had already received treatment. 
Amazingly, the intense pain was almost completely gone. Rather, I was feeling 
overwhelmed with the strong desire to serve humanity to my utmost capacity. 
And my affection for Baba was so strong that it seemed to be physically 
pressing out against my breast. 

Right, not wrong 

Mahindra used to serve as one of Baba's bodyguards. When he heard that I 
had just begun to experience the stick, he told me a story from the time that 
Baba was in jail: 

My old friend, Awadhanath Prasad begged me to arrange a meeting with 
Baba. He told me he had done something bad with a lady who 



159 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


worked in fields under his supervision. He had committed other sins too. 

When we entered His cell, Baba immediately yelled at Awadha- 
nath, "Why did you come? Animal, pig!" 

"I came due to Mahindra." 

"Mahindra, why did you bring this nasty boy?" 

"Baba, please help him." 

"Bring me my stick." 

I looked around cell but I couldn't find Baba's stick, so I borrowed 
the constable's and gave it to Baba. Right there in front of prison guards, Baba 
beat Awadhanath. Then He told him to rub his nose on floor, which he did until 
it bled. 

Afterward, when we went outside, the 
CID [Central Intelligence Department! wanted Awadhanath to file a case against 
Baba for beat-ing him but he refused. "He is my guru! What He did was right, 
not wrong!" 

After that he became a completely pure and exemplary man. He now spends all 
his spare time doing social service. 

Power comes from difficulties 

Margiis and workers are present from all over the world. Just think! When Baba 
was arrested in December, 1971, there were Margiis in 
only five countries. Now, seven years later, Ananda Marga is active in 
over eighty countries. 

The Tantric guru and his disciples always gain power from their difficulties. 
Every effort made by the Gandhi regime to destroy Ananda Marga eventually 
resulted in strengthening our mission. 

This reminds me of two statements Baba made while still in prison. The first 
was during the emergency rule, when He was convicted by a kangaroo court 
and sentenced to life imprisonment. In that seemingly darkest of moments. He 
turned to His attorney, smiled, and wrote on His message board: "Now the 
tables will turn." 42 Soon after, Indira Gandhi lost her power, and our workers 
and Baba were vindicated. 

The other occurred at the end of the emergency, when the ban against 
Ananda Marga was lifted and our workers were released from 

42 For many months during His imprisonment, due to the after-effects of his poisoning, Baba 
was unable to speak; H e communicated by writing.

jail. Many of them had undergone great suffering. This was especially true of 
those who the authorities had physically and psychically punished in an effort 
to obtain written denunciations of Ananda Marga. Baba's comment at that time 
was "The workers have passed through the blazing crucible. Their iron has been 
forged into steel. Previously they (Gandhi and others) believed Ananda Marga 
to be a dangerous baby snake. Now, thanks to them, it has become a fully 
grown snake." 

Stockholm. After working as the Scandinavian regional secretary for nearly 
three years, I have now been transferred. My posting is to a section which 
previously did not exist outside of India: Volunteers Service Department or SD. 
Today I begin my duties as the European Chief Secretary of SD. The programs 
of SD include physical social services for the needy, survival training, security, 
relevant higher philosophy, and training in basic service-skills such as first aid. 
Among the means for providing this training are weekend SD camps, which 
also encourage collective discipline and unity through group exercises. In addi¬ 
tion to all of this is a sub-section called Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures 
Club. 

I think I'm going to enjoy this new job.

CHAPTER 9 


Kapalika Meditation 


Avadhuta 

Calcutta. Today I was informed that Baba is considering my application to 
become an avadhuta. 43 What is the meaning of avadhuta! Ancient scriptures 
give the following differing descriptions: 

* Avadhutas and avadhutikas have given up lust for worldly things; their 
speech is simple and straightforward, and they always live in the present. 

* Though their bodies may be smeared with dust, their minds are always 
pure. Even if they do not care much for meditation or concentration, they are 
always in the state of Cosmic Thought. 


43 Since becoming acharya, I had been working as a brahmacarii, i.e. a monk who teaches the six 
basic lessons of meditation. I had not yet learned a higher Tantric meditation, called kapalika , 
which is taught only by Baba directly. This meditation is performed in a graveyard or 
cremation ground between the hours of midnight and 3:00 AM , at least once monthly during 
the time of the new moon. The eerie, death-shrouded atmosphere helps to manifest one's latent 
fears and baser instincts while the lonely silence encourages deep concentration. By this 
practice, the aspirant rapidly gains control over the lower self. At this time, Baba also gives the 
initiation which follows the brahmacarii stage, called avadhuta (or avadhutika for Didis). In 
Ananda M arga, the brahmacarii wears an orange shirt, orange turban, and a white lungi 
(sarong) or pants, while the avadhuta wears an orange turban, orange shirt and orange lungi. 
The uniform is a compromise with the pressing need of modern society for such workers: 
historically an avadhuta was a naked yogi covered only by ashes, unattached to pleasure and 
pain, and rarely, if ever, was seen in society. 

In India, the word Kapalika is much misunderstood. M any people believe it refers to black- 
magic left-hand Tantrics who appear totally wild: drinking wine, eating human flesh, engaging 
in sexual rituals, and so on. It is nothing other than an injustice to the Tantric tradition when 
people act in thisway and claim to bekapalikas. 



Kapalika Meditation 


162 


* They have given up thoughts concerned with solid, liquid, luminous, 
aerial or ethereal factors. They do not fear death, nor are they controlled by the 
darkness of ego. 

* They are free from all worldly fetters. Their lives are pure from beginning, 
middle, to end. They always remain in the state of bliss. 

* They have no attachment, even for such qualities as patience and courage. 
They worship neither Shiva (Consciousness) nor Shakta (Primal Energy), but 
remain absorbed in the ideation of Brahma (infinite God), like a second 
Maheshvara (a name of Shiva, father of Tantra). 

During the seven years of Baba's imprisonment no worker became avadhuta 
because the initiation required privacy. Furthermore, in the seven thousand 
years since Shiva founded the Tantric cult no non-Asian has learned the 
kapalika practice. Thus something special, something new, is in the works. 

The test 

Four of the candidates being considered by Ftim are non-Indian. He called 
us individually into His room. We were told that He would test our readiness for 
the kapalika training. 

It was different than any test I've undergone. I'll explain only part of it. 

He called me first. As with Personal Contact, I was alone with Him. But 
whereas before He sat in a comfortable unassuming posture, this time He was 
erect, permeated by an intense transcendentality (how else to describe that 
mood?). As He spoke, the images He described became as real as the room 
itself. 

"You are in the cremation ground in the dead of the night..." He said, a fire 
burning in His eyes, "everything hides behind a blanket of darkness ... vultures 
flap their wings... a muggy breeze shivers your spine... from some unknown 
comer echoes 'hooot... hooot... hooot'—will you be afraid?" 

"No, Baba." 

"Very good," He brought His solemn face close to mine. "And if you plunge 
deep, deep down into silence ... only leaves minutely rustling in the breath of 
shadows ... your heart beats slowly ... slowly ... slowly ... when suddenly! what 
hey? scores of faces, nay, skulls are all upon you! raining like arrows on your 
head! scowling, grating their teeth, hissing, wailing!—will you be afraid?" 



163 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"No, Baba." 

"Very good. But, then, how will my boy react if I tell him to take off his clothes 
and move in the streets without inhibition? Will he do it?" "Yes, Baba." 

"Then, go and do it. Now." 

Immediately without a flick of hesitation, I stood up and started for the door. As 
my hand reached the door handle. He said, "Stop!" I turned and faced Him. 

"Very good. Very good. Now tell me ... how many blades are in that fan?" 

In that moment nothing could have been more strange than such a common 
question! I looked up at the ceiling-fan—the blades turned lazily, barely 
merging into each other. I tried to count them. 

"I think...there maybe three. Baba." 

"You think, or you know?" 

"I...I...think, Baba." 

"The answer is wrong. You should have said. Baba, may I turn the fan off 
so that I can properly count the blades?'" 

I laughed, while He smiled broadly. The "test" was finished. 

He placed His hand on my head, then I embraced Him, and reluctantly left, 
an extraordinary energy vibrating through every vertebrae of my spine. 

Next day. We four were given the thick "Senior Acharya Diary" today and 
told to copy it. After doing so, we must pass the senior acharya exam, another 
prerequisite before receiving kapalika initiation. For various reasons the time is 
short, so there's no time for sleep until the copying is finished. Then we will 
have to cram for the exam. 

Two days later. It was 4:00 a.m., and we were immersed in the endless 
copying. Dada J dropped his pen, and still mindlessly went on writing with his 
finger. A little later when he fell off his chair, his shocked expression made us 
split our sides laughing. 

Two days later. I am in the biggest hurry, because I, alone among the four, 
must attend a workers' meeting in Delhi on the 11th. Before that I must pass the 
exam, which covers not only the material in the 



164 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


diary (which I finally finished copying today), but also all the material in 
Baba's book Yogic Treatment, and advanced spiritual and social philosophy. I 
started taking the test today, but the examiner failed me right away because I 
had not memorized any of the Sanskrit shlokas in the diary. There are forty 
shlokas, each having at least four lines. I wonder how I can manage it. 

Next day. So far I have only been able to memorize seven shlokas. So I 
failed again. My mind seems blocked. Perhaps it's due to exhaustion. 

Next day. This morning my mind inexplicably shifted into cosmic gear. 
Within forty minutes I had memorized the remaining thirty-three shlokas. I was 
amazed, having never before experienced this sort of phenomenal mental 
power. 

The examiner, however, didn't seem surprised. After passing me on the 
shlokas, he went on to the other subjects, and one by one I passed them. 

In the evening. Dada Tadbhavananda (a senior worker) who was scheduled 
to fly with me to Delhi came to the room and spoke to the examiner. 

"You've got to pass this boy quickly or we'll miss our flight." 

"Don't try to pressure me," said the examiner nonchalantly. "Now finally 
let's turn to C aryacarya. " u 

"What!" I exclaimed. "I didn't know we'd be examined on Caryacarya. 
How about just forgetting it, Dadaji?" I hadn't studied the book at all. 

"I won't make exceptions for anyone." 

Suddenly the electricity went out. 

"Someone find some candles," the examiner said. 

We all searched around, but couldn't find any. 

"Hey, you've got to pass him now!" said Tadbhavanandaji to the examiner. 

"Nothing doing." 

A few minutes passed, and still no candle appeared. "For God's sake," yelled 
Tadbhavanandaji, "we've got to leave this minute for the airport!" 


44 Caryacarya isa book on social and spiritual functions 



165 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Alright..." said the examiner, grudgingly. "Give me your diary." 

I gave him the book and heard him scratch his signature in the dark. 

A few seconds later the electricity came on again, just as suddenly as it had 
gone out. Our eyes blinked in the bright light. 

" Victory to Baba!" roared Tadbhavanandaji. "Baba's grace. The taxi's 
waiting!" 

Yes, it was a novel sort of grace that made the lights fail instead of me. 

A special kind of attention 

Delhi. Although it was only two months since I last saw Baba, it seemed 
like two eons. I had an extreme desire to see Him again. Because there were 
only about fifteen persons this morning when He walked into the room to give 
His talk, it seemed almost a private audience. 

He sat in the chair which was immediately in front of me. We all sat on the 
floor looking up at Him expectantly. He gazed at each of us before speaking, 
with one exception: me. 

B aba, look at me, I thought. But He did not. 

Instead He started speaking. Usually while speaking He rarely looks at 
anyone. But this morning He smilingly turned His face right and left, melting 
each heart with His affectionate and highly personal glances. 

But He didn't look at me. 

Why? I thought. Did I do something wrong? 

Although He spoke in English, I was so perturbed by His behavior that I 
couldn't understand a single word. His tender, doe-like eyes rested 
momentarily on each and every face, but when He turned His gaze toward the 
center, He either lowered or raised His eyes just when He was about to look at 
me. 

I Ve done some horrible sin, I thought. The anxiety made my head warm. 

Perhaps... perhaps it was those harsh words to my office secretary? No, 
no—that wasn't very serious. Perhaps it was because I ate sweets 
unnecessarily? Ah, but He hardly cares for that... 

It went on and on: everyone thrilling to the play of His eyes, His refusing 
to look at me, and my speculations continuing to bubble, heating my spine, 
tensing my body. What great offense had I committed in these last two 
months? My thoughts tripped over each other, trying to find the answer. 
Though the air wasn't hot, and everyone was comfortable in the fan's breeze, I 
was sweating and shaking, feeling hotter and 



Kapalika Meditation 


166 


more confused with each passing moment. My thinking galloped at such a pace that 
it went out of control. My head burned and my heart ached as I stared at this 
indifferent Baba, tears coming out of my eyes, wondering, wondering. 

Suddenly a single thought burst out through the forest of confusion (and these 
were the exact words): That H e ignores me is in itself a special kind of attention. 

Before the meaning of this sentence could even register in my brain, Baba 
interrupted His speech, sharply swiveled His head around, turned His face directly 
toward mine, and smiled. I distinctly heard Him say, "Yes," though His lips didn't 
form the word. He kept His eyes glued on mine for a long moment—perhaps five 
or ten seconds. 

Gradually the significance of His message sunk into me, and I smiled back, 
mentally telling Him. Oh it's beautiful, Baba. Thank you. By the time He resumed 
His speech, my soul was swimming in relief and joy. 

After Baba left the room, several of the workers and Margis who noticed what 
had happened came to me, and asked, "Why did Baba treat you like that today?" 

I told them what I had experienced, then added, "As to why I was graced with 
this lesson today, I don't know. But I hope to remember forever that when I'rn 
feeling alone and neglected, even then, especially then. He is giving me exactly 
what I need." 

Dada Shraddhananda's dry smile 

During an official workers' meeting at which Baba was not present, a serious 
discussion was held concerning the twenty-eight departments of "Ananda Marga 
General". Eventually we came to Tribal & Backward People's Welfare Section 
(TBPW). 

One Dada from Berlin Sector said, "In my sector there are very few countries 
having tribal people. Yet we receive general targets from Center applicable for all 
regions. How are we to respond to TBPW targets in those countries without tribal 
people?" 

There was silence as the workers from Center were thinking what to reply. 
Then the eldest worker of our mission, Dada Shraddhananda (about 70 years old), 
said in a dry voice, "In those countries where there are no tribal and backward 
people, the first work of the TBPW section will be to create tribal and backward 
people." 



167 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


In that sober atmosphere, it took a few moments for us to catch his point. 
Then we all roared with laughter. 45 

Wise, wiser, wisest 

Patna. After completing the Delhi workers' meeting. Baba traveled to Patna, 
and we four followed Him. We are still waiting for confirmation on the kapalika 
training. Meanwhile, we are attending the workers' meetings with Baba. 

During such meetings. Baba commonly singles out one worker for 
scoldings. Although the targeted worker gains the greatest benefit, we all gain 
some psychic profit by witnessing these scenes. After all, it is His duty to help us 
diminish our complexes of fear, shame, inferiority, superiority and so on. 

The past few days it was usually Dada T who received His tongue-lashings. 
(Though T is a senior worker, and recognized as one of our best, he nevertheless 
becomes as nervous as anyone when bearing the brunt of Baba's "venom". This 
in itself I find amazing, because outside of such sessions, T is a superbly 
confident man—how skillful Baba is in drawing out our deepest hidden 
instincts.) In front of about sixty workers, T was instructed to give his work- 
done report. Fully expecting to be rebuked somehow, he was uneasy even before 
starting to speak. 

He stood on Baba's left side, reading aloud. "Ah ... Baba ... today the tri¬ 
offices were increased by seven... rather... yesterday there were 186 block-level 
tri-offices ... and today there are 194, ah ... excuse me 192 ... and regarding bi¬ 
offices ..." 

45 This entry is included to give a glimpse into a lesser known aspect of Dada Shraddha-nanda, 
who later became Ananda M arga president in 1990. He once told me that Baba personally taught 
him many things on the science of humor, and that he was thinking to compose a booklet on the 
subject. Over the years, I occasionally asked him when he would write that booklet, but he never 
had time. 

Some months ago, 1 again asked him about writing that booklet, but he avoided responding. 

I nstead he switched the subject by saying," I once met a man living in a very cold region north of 
I ndia. I was curious about his daily lifestyle, so I asked him about his usual time of prayer, what 
sort of clothes people there commonly wore, what sort of food he ate, what times he rose in the 
morning and retired in the evening, and so on. When I asked him when he usually took his bath, 
he replied, 'I usually take my bath in M ay or J une." 1 

Anyway, if he would ever grab a few hours to make a draft of the booklet, I would offer to 
edit it. 



Kapalika Meditation 


168 


Baba squinted His eyes, contorted his upper lip, scratched His head, and, 
looking to His right at His personal assistant, said in a high nasal tone, "What's 
this? What does he have for a head? What say you? Does he have a brick for a 
head? Doesn't he know how to speak?" 

Dada T was sweating profusely. 

Closing His eyes, Baba motioned at him using a limp left index linger, and 
said, "Go on. Go on. Don't waste the time of all these fine gentlemen here." 

I was sitting immediately in front of Baba, about two feet from Him. It may 
sound cruel, but I was thoroughly enjoying the drama. In any case, it was for 
our development. 

"Ah ... well... regarding bi-offices," said T, "in 10,337 blocks there were 
178 covered today ... ah ... rather yesterday ... bringing the percentage to 2% ... 
and today..." 

Baba yawned politely but conspicuously, then gave a wink and a smile 
toward the workers on His right. 

"... and today... there is an increase of seven, bringing the percentage to 2% 
... what? ... yes, it's still 2% ..." 

Baba creased His cheeks into dimples as if He would smile, but frowned 
simultaneously—incongruous and thus humorous for us—turned toward T and 
said bitingly, "Arraay, read your report correctly. You are wiser enough." 

Immediately I thought, "Wiser? Baba should have said. 'You are wise 
enough'." 

Like a rubber band snapping back. He turned His face to the front and thmst 
it into mine, saying, "Wiser—not wise. Wiser than you!" He had caught my 
thought precisely! 

I exploded into laughter and could not stop laughing for several seconds. 
Two Dadas tried to restrain me, but Baba clenched His teeth together, turned 
the corners of His lips into a tight smile, jutted His chin out and nodded 
knowingly at me, making the whole scene all the more jocular. 

He affects us. He helps us. He loves us with even the slightest moves He 
makes, and with each word He speaks. 

Seeing God 

We are staying at the home of an Indian lawyer, Ranjan Dwivedi, and his 
American wife Parashakti, both of whom are great devotees of 



169 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Baba. Early this morning, Parashakti told us the Baba-dream she had last night. 

"I was sitting in an auditorium in the middle of an audience, and just next 
to me sat Baba. On the stage, different spiritual groups were demonstrating 
their techniques of meditation. 

"The man representing the first group closed his eyes and began 
meditating. Within moments, his body was vibrating, rotating in circles, and 
making slight jumping movements. At the same time he made grunting sounds. 

"I turned to Baba, and said. Baba, why can't we experience that with our 
meditation?' He didn't reply, but only smiled at me with a glint in His eyes. 

"The next man began meditating, and soon he was levitating high above the 
table on which he had been sitting. 

"I looked at Baba and complained, 'Baba, that never happens to us in our 
meditation.' Again, no response except a glint in His eyes. 

"The third man breathed rapidly, shook violently, and fell backward, 
banging his head on the table. He lay there in a trance. Several persons 
carefully picked him up and carried him through the aisle of the audience, 
moving toward the exit. Before they could take more than two or three steps, 
the man awoke, sat up and exclaimed, "I've seen God! I've seen God!" 

"I said to Baba, 'This is too much, Baba. Why can't we have such visions?' 

"As the group carrying the man passed by us, he was still saying, T've seen 
God! I've seen God!' Then his eyes suddenly lit up brightly as he said, 'And 
there He is!' He pointed at Baba, again saying, 'There He is!' 

"That's when I woke up. Well, Dadas, what do you think of that?" she said. 

We smiled glintingly. 

While Baba was in jail, Parashakti met Him many times. She had also 
spoken to most of the other visiting Margis and workers. We asked her to tell 
us about some of the extraordinary incidents that occurred during those visits. 
One of the stories went like this: 

A Margi from Africa was in a visiting group. He had an intense desire to 
hear Baba speak his native language, Swahili. Baba talked in 



Kapalika Meditation 


170 


turn with each of the Margis present in His cell. When he came to this brother 
and asked a question, the brother replied in standard Swahili. Baba said, "Eh? 
What did you say?" The brother had to change his reply into English. After 
more conversation with everyone. Baba asked him another question, and he 
again replied in Swahili. Again Baba feigned not to understand. Finally, when 
the guards announced that the time was finished and everyone was offering 
their respects to Baba, the Margi approached Baba with folded hands, begging, 
"Please, Baba say something in Swahili!" Baba smiled at him and said in that 
brother's exact local dialect of Swahili, "I am a stupid person. How can I speak 
in Swahili?" 

Mental yo-yo 

Yesterday morning the General Secretary told us, "Wait at the Dwivedi's 
house. It is likely Baba will call you for kapalika initiation today." Today was 
the last possible day remaining for us to learn the kapalika, because it requires 
at least three days practice after initiation, and we must leave for Europe in four 
days. 

We did nothing but wait all day. The clock struck 7:00 p.m. Soon Baba's 
evening darshan (spiritual talk) would start, and if we went on waiting we 
would miss that also. We put on our turbans and were preparing to leave just as 
a motorcycle roared up the driveway. 

"Where have you good-for-nothings been?" yelled Dada Ramananda. 
Baba's personal assistant. "Baba has been requesting to see you since 5:00! 
Nonsense! Now it's too late." And he was off before we could even comment. 

Of all the injustices! We had simply followed the order of the General 
Secretary, and now were being severely penalized. 

"What shall we do now?" asked one Dada. "Go to Baba's darshan?" 

"Baba's darshan is every night," said another. "But as long as there's the 
slightest chance that Baba might teach us kapalika, I think we should still try." 
We all agreed and set out for His house. 

Just as we arrived at Baba's house. He came out of His door, walking 
toward the car. We ran up to Him, and did prostration at His feet. 

"Oh it's those scoundrels. I waited for them since 5:00. They wasted my 
valuable time. The buggers." The car-door slammed, and He drove away. 

"At this rate we'll never receive initiation," said one Dada. 



171 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"It's just His game," I replied. "He'll play it however He likes. There's no 
value in being anxious." I can't explain why, but I did not care when or whether 
we might learn the kapalika. If He wanted to teach me I wanted to learn— 
otherwise not. 

We were still talking in this vein when again we heard the sound of His car. 

"Strange!" someone said. "The darshan's over so quickly." 

The car parked, and Baba stepped out. He spoke in Bengali to those with 
Him. As He came a little nearer to us. though He pretended not to be speaking 
to us four. He changed to English and said, "A completely unacceptable 
arrangement. Due to this carelessness the darshan had to be canceled! A most 
pitiable condition. A shame and a sham." The others walked with their heads 
down, playing the embarrassed role. 

When He was close enough, we again did prostration, and He said, "What, 
these boys are still here?" Our hopes lifted... 

"Have they not done enough harm?" ...and then shattered. "I waited for 
them since 5:00, and they didn't even have the common courtesy to respond to 
my call. Wasting my time. Nonsense, nonsense." 

We were still laying there when He entered the house. 

"We've got no chance," said one Dada. 

"On the contrary," said another, "He may have canceled the darshan and 
disappointed 700 or 800 people just so He would have time to teach us." 

A minute later we were called into Baba's room. He lay on His bed, being 
massaged by a local family-acharya. 

After we did our prostrations, Baba began to speak in a serious tone. "I 
summoned you boys here for the purpose of telling you I won't be able to teach 
you the kapalika since you were so undisciplined not to come at the scheduled 
time." 

Now up, now down—He was playing our minds like yo-yos. There was an 
awkward silence as we hesitated between leaving and ... and what? I struggled 
hard to think how to get us out of this quandary. 

One Dada spoke slowly, "Ah ... Baba, excuse me ..." 

Baba sat up slightly, as if He were waiting for this, saying, "Yes, yes, what 
do you want to say?" 

"Ah ... I don't mean to put anyone else in trouble, but we were instructed to 
wait in Ranjan Dwivedi's house until a messenger conveyed your call. No one 
came until 7:00." 



Kapalika Meditation 


172 


Now even Baba looked hopeful, saying, "Yes, it may be, it may be. Perhaps 
Ramanandaji was so busy that the matter passed him by." He turned to the 
acharya massaging His feet, and asked, "What do you think? Shall I believe 
them and instruct them the kapalika?" 

Coming out of a deep concentration on the right foot, the acharya, eyes 
misted by his mood, said. "My thought. Baba? Oh, I think you should not teach 
them." 

I was shocked. Though I highly respect this Dada, at that moment I felt like 
grabbing him by the shirt, shaking him hard and yelling, "What kind of 
stupidity are you speaking?" But I did nothing. Meanwhile, he calmly 
scrutinized us. 

"Perhaps you are correct," Baba said. "Perhaps. But we should be sure. 
Hold the big toe of my right foot." 

The acharya complied. 

"Now what do you think?" Baba asked. 

"They are telling the truth. Baba." 

"Alright," He said. "I accept your judgment." He turned to us. "But you 
boys here, are you interested to learn?" 

We gave the obvious reply. He dismissed the acharya from the room and 
we got down to business. 

As to the initiation itself, there is little to say—it is secret. I can only 
comment that for the next two hours that room, for me, became transmuted into 
the infinite macrocosm saturated with mystic potency, outside of which nothing 
existed. 

Baba told us that during the initial three days' practice we would burn 50% 
of our reactive momenta concerned with fear, shame and hatred; after which 
we would have to work on the remaining half—which explains why those who 
learn kapalika appear undeniably brighter from the very first week 

We performed our first kapalika meditation at midnight. When we came 
back, Dada Ramananda was waiting for us. According to Baba's instruction, he 
gave us our new names. I am now called Acharya Dharmavedananda 
Avadhuta. Veda means "deep knowledge". So, as Baba later told me, 
Dharmavedananda means "he who attains the supreme beatitude through deep 
knowledge of the path of righteousness."

I become a different man 

Ydrefors, Sweden, 1979. Today I took up my temporary duties here as 
acharya trainer. 46 Dada Dhrtibodhananda has been reposted back to India. His 
replacement will come "as soon as possible"—but exactly who that will be and 
when is unclear. In the meantime, I am to keep the ship afloat. 

We have two buildings, five minutes walk apart from each other, which 
separately house the sisters and brothers—about forty trainees total, mostly 
from Europe, North America and South America. We are deep in a lonely but 
beautiful forest in southern Sweden, idyllic for meditation and self¬ 
development. 

Just after I arrived, I was sitting with Dada Dhrtibodhananda, and a senior 
avadhuta, Dada K. There was a knock on the door and a German trainee 
entered, looking sad and confused. 

"Excuse me, Dadas... I want to go home," he said. "I for my mother 
worry..." 

"Yes, alright...,” began Dhrtibodhanandaji. 

"Sorry for interrupting you," I said softly, "but now I am the trainer, so I'll 
have to handle the matter." I turned to the trainee. "Please wait outside, and I'll 
call you. I came only five minutes ago, so I need a bit of time." 

He went out and shut the door. 

46 At that time there were four such centers in the world: Benares, Nepal, the Philippines and 
Sweden. The Sweden program had been started several years before by Dada 
Dhrtibodhananda. The training center in Nepal has since been closed and new ones opened in 
Africa and India. 



"Don't imagine that there's any way that brother can become an acharya," 
said Dada K. "Better to release him immediately. This talk of his mother is just 
an excuse; he knows very well that the organization is ready to look after her 
needs. He simply feels insecure." 

"Yes, he's been depressed for days now," said Dhrtibodhanandaji, "I'm sure 
he's finished." 

"I respect you both highly," I said. "But whether I like it or not, Baba has 
now entrusted me with this duty. So I shall see for myself when I speak to 
him." 

"Try if it pleases you," said Dada K, "but there's no hope." 

I was feeling different than I had ever felt in my life. The change was both 
odd and sudden. From the moment I'd arrived, there had been a kind of buzzing 
in my brain, though my perception was sharp, abnormally sharp. (As I write 
these words, it is now late night, and the buzzing continues. For the first time in 
my life I feel in total command of myself, able to follow perfectly all our 
disciplines, both physical and mental. It is clear that He has directly 
empowered me with the capacity to properly guide these trainees. I am a 
different man now.) 

We continued speaking for half an hour, then I left the room to deal with 
the German brother. He was sitting on a bench with his head between his 
knees. I had met him several times before. I remembered that he was 
sometimes high-strung and at other times very calm—an independent type, 
with a character of his own. 

I put my hand on his back and said in a low voice, "Brother..." 

He raised his head. His eyes were red, and tears were streaming down his 
face. 

"Dadaji, please ... let me leave...." His voice choked. 

"I won't stop you from going. But..." My head was empty. Abruptly a 
thought appeared. "But first consider one simple question: will Baba be happy 
if you leave?" 

He stared at me. After a moment, his crying stopped, and he said, "No, He 
wouldn't like it." 

"Then, what do you really want to do? Do you want to please Him. or do 
you want to do something else?" 

"Of course I want to please Him." 

"Then, how about staying another few days? You can leave anytime, but 
once you're gone it's difficult to come back."

"Okay," he said, sitting straight. "I'll stay. At least for a few days." 47 

The Problem-Maker is also the Solution-Giver 

Circumstances compelled the two Dadas to leave rather hastily so I was 
unable to get a comprehensive picture of the trainees or the training center. 

I called in the office secretary and asked him how much money we had in 
the account. 

"I'm sorry, Dada. I don't have any money." 

"What do you mean? Is there no money here?" 

"Well, if you don't have any, and I don't have any, then maybe there isn't 
any," he said grinning. A typical response of a devotee—to smile in the face of 
a giant problem. 

"Yeah, well, thanks," I said. "Please leave me for a while so I can think." 

I sat alone looking at the walls of my room. But I didn't feel alone. My head 
was still buzzing pleasantly, and I had the uncanny feeling that I was inside 
Baba's breast. I felt pure, unafraid, and sure that He would solve any and every 
problem. 

This room's messy, I thought. Before thinking of anything, I should clean it 
up. 

After working for an hour, I opened a cupboard. It was full of the trainees' 
legal documents and other personal effects. While putting these in order I came 
upon a wallet stuffed with 700 Swedish kroner. There was no identification. 

Could this be Baba's little help1 1 thought. 

I questioned the trainees but no one knew its owner. 

Thanks. But of course that's only a start. 

Two days later. This morning a Norwegian brother approached me. 
"Dadaji, I need your advice. A few weeks ago the postman delivered 4000 
kroner to me. But when he wrote up the account, instead of subtracting the 
amount, he added it. So, I now hold a credit for 8000 kroner. What should I 
do?" 

47 The proof of this pudding lies not only in the fact that he later became acharya, but that 
presently, i.e., more than ten years later, as an avadhuta, he is a top-class worker named Dada 
Vijaksarananda. 



I started laughing and he joined me, guffawing with gusto. 

"Usually I would inform the post office of their mistake," I said. "But in this 
case we better not make it too hard for Baba to help us tide over our little crisis. If 
they want to give the money. I'm willing to temporarily accept it — and pay it 
back to the post office later. If such an act causes me to undergo some negative 
reaction for the benefit of the training center — so be it." 

And so our piggy-bank became full. 

Three days later. "Dadaji," said an American trainee, "I never expected a tax 
rebate from last year, but today 9000 kroner arrived for me. Please take it for the 
training center." 

A bit excessive grace. Baba, but... what's that You say? ... no, it's no problem, 
no problem. We'll be glad to accept it... (After all, you never know if tomorrow 
He'll enjoy Himself thoroughly by smashing our car or something like that.) 

Tantric cows 

Every time I walk between the brothers' and sisters' training centers, I get a 
supra-aesthetic thrill from the landscape. On one side of the street is a dense 
forest, packed with eerie vibes. On the other side, adjacent to the brothers' house, 
is a large cow pasture, which is dotted with giant boulders of interesting shapes 
that I can only label Tantric. I feel so happy here. 

The cows, too, are special. Whenever the brothers sing kiirtan, all twenty 
cows mosey over toward our house and crowd themselves in the tiny corner of 
the pasture which is closest to the meditation room. There they remain chewing 
their cuds for the duration of each kiirtan, even daily akhanda kiirtan. 48 


,s Akhanda means long. Akhanda kiirtan is always performed in multiples of three hours, for 
example 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 hours. There is no limit to how long it continues. The dancers 
participate according to their interest, or in some cases certain groups are assigned certain times. 
Generally, everyone who participates becomes greatly inspired by the end of akhanda kiirtan. It is 
common that new meditators who have never been able to concentrate effectively will come to 
know for the first time what a tranquil mind feels like during long kiirtan. Even physical 
problems and difficult mental problems are often mysteriously overcome through the immense 
positive energy generated by akhanda kiirtan.

Thought becomes matter 

Today while eating lunch in my room, I opened my closet to get some com 
chips but unfortunately they were finished. I wish I had some more chips, I 
thought. Immediately there was a knock at the door. "Come in." 

"Dadaji, I just came back from collection (of donations from the food shops 
in nearby towns), and I thought you might like these." He held out ten bags of 
com chips. 

Next day. While resting in my room today, I was thinking. The scene here is 
perfect. Not only am I content in being able to foliow yogic discipline and 
morality in detail—also my meditation is first-class, I get more than enough 
spiritual company, time for studying and discussing philosophy, excitement and 
drama (at least one or two of the trainees face some sort of personal crisis 
daily), maximum kiirtan, a beautiful environment, and excellent food. There 
must be something I'm missing here... for example, there must be some food I'm 
not getting... well, it's true there's no dried fruits. 

Then I left for the sisters' house to give a class. As I walked in their door, a 
visitor, Didi Ananda Prajina greeted me. 

"Dada, I expected to go to India, but my plans have changed. I was going to 
bring this with me to give to some Didis, but now I'd like to give it to you." 

She handed me a three kilogram bag of raisins. 

Next day. Tonight, before going out to do my kapalika meditation, I thought 
that it would be nice to eat something a little special to prepare for tomorrow's 
fasting. Of course there was nothing but the usual stuff. Then I went to the 
graveyard together with trainee Dhyanesh. 

When we came back, it was 1:30 a.m. Everyone was sleeping except 
Dhyanesh and I. Again I had the same thought. It would be nice to have 
something a little special, but.... 

Immediately Dhyanesh said. "Dadaji, would you like to have something a 
little special?" 

I laughed. But instead of telling him the cause of my reaction, I said, "Sure. 
But I suppose there's nothing but the usual stuff."

He raised his eyebrows, saying, "Well, I was on collection today. Perhaps 
you'd like to see what I saved in a cupboard in the kitchen." 

He ran off, only to come back a minute later with a honey-dew melon and 
two packages of vanilla eclairs covered in whipped cream. 

"Only at this time of the year do the Swedes make these special cream 
cakes," he said. 

Two days later. Between breakfast and lunch on the day after fasting I 
usually drink a lot of water. Just before leaving my room to go to the sister's 
house for class this morning, I thought, They never offer me more than one 
glass of lemon-water. Rather than ask for more, I thought it would be better to 
drink some extra water before I left. When I arrived at their house, I took my 
seat. In front of me, where they had always placed one cup of lemon-water, 
there were two cups. I was shocked. 

I pointed at the cups, mumbling, "Two ... there's two...." 

It wasn't just a matter of two cups—rather, it was my sudden realization 
that any slightest whim I'd had over the last few days had been immediately 
fulfilled. 

"What's the matter. Dadaji?" said one sister. "I thought perhaps one glass of 
lemon-water was not enough for you, so there's also a glass of fresh apple 
juice." 

"No, no. It's good," I said. "Thank you very much." 

That's what I said. But what I thought was: Occult power. The power to 
Immediately get whatever I desire. I must not use it. From this moment on, as 
long as I am trainer, I shall not permit myself to wish for anything. Occult 
powers are a dangerous temptation on the spiritual path. While the Avidya 
Tantrics (black magicians) aim for such powers, we Vidya Tantrics steer clear 
of them. Our goal is only to serve God. 49 


49 Avidya istheextroversial or centrifugal force causing attraction for external objects: it leads 
to ignorance or illusion. Avidya Tantra consists of practices designed for the attainment of occult 
powers. Vidya is the introversial or centripetal force which causes attraction to the Supreme 
Nucleus: it leads to knowledge, understanding or correct perception. Vidya Tantra consists of 
practices which help the aspirant surrender to God, and ultimately become one with God. Vidya 
Tantra says: M orality is the base, intuition the means, and life divine the goal.

Grace in the form of pain 

Over the last few days I have kept my mind free from the slightest 
unnecessary wish. But today another problem arose. Shortly before a 24-hour 
kiirtan was to finish, I was standing in my room. From nowhere, and without any 
apparent cause, a sharp pain stabbed within my stomach. 

I sat down, but the pain continued. I laid down, but it grew worse. 

Since I had to end the 24 hour kiirtan. I reluctantly left my room to join the 
trainees. When we sat for collective meditation I pulled myself into the corner 
where no one would see me sitting in agony with my knees doubled against my 
chest. My suffering only increased. 

Worst of all, at the end of the meditation I would have to give an inspirational 
talk. How could I manage? 

The moment came to speak, and as soon as I began, the pain instantly 
disappeared. I told spiritual and humorous stories for forty-five minutes. 
Everyone, including me. thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The very moment I finished speaking, however, the pain returned with 
increased intensity. It was so bad I couldn't eat. 

Now it is night as I write. The pain is still present, though slightly decreased. I 
hope it will be gone by tomorrow. 


Two weeks later. The pain in my stomach did not finish the next day, nor the 
next nor the next. Today, it left as unexpectedly as it came. I did not tell anyone, 
except the trainee who assists me, and I instructed him not to mention it to others. 
It was not the sort of trouble which could be cured by medicine or treatment. 
Rather it was a test I had to undergo as a result of successfully controlling myself 
in this ideal spiritual environment. 

The clearest indication of this was the fact that every time I had a class to 
give, or an important meeting to attend, the pain ceased. 

No height is too high 

Dada Dhruvananda, the new trainer, arrived today. Together with a charge 
hand-over, I gave him an account with more than 10,000 kroner. Though the 
mental condition of most of the trainees had been uneasy when I first arrived, it 
now seemed that everyone was happy.

"How could you manage so well?" he asked. 

"Baba did everything. I did nothing." As 1 said this, I felt something sneak 
back inside me from my previous normal flawed self. I checked for the buzzing 
in my head, but could not find it. 

Now, having resumed my previous duty, I am again an ordinary monk. 

No Tantric aspirant should think that high spiritual states are beyond his or 
her reach. Whatever is needed, He gives us. Though it comes only by His 
grace, and not by our own efforts, we must constantly strive for perfection— 
otherwise we would be unsuitable to serve as His channels. 

There is word that Baba may soon travel outside of India. They say He will 
come to Europe and nowhere else. I don't know whether or not to believe it. It 
seems too good to be true.

Embarking on an unreal dream 

Stockholm. April 1979. The Mainz office called today. Baba's trip is 
definitely on! He will be coming together with an entourage of 10 or so Dadas, 
Didis and Margis. They say He'll stay for a month, touring Switzerland, 
Germany, Sweden, Holland, Spain, France, and Italy. As chief secretary of the 
Volunteers Service Department I'll be in charge of Baba's security and many 
other aspects of the program. Dada Karunananda and I will be the main 
organizers. 

From today my main duty is to get ready for the tour. Somehow the whole 
thing still feels unreal to me. Like a dream. 

Lyon, France. May. Baba was scheduled to arrive one week from today but 
so far He and two other Dadas still do not have their passports. After all our 
planning we are still not sure if they will come or not. This is typical of course. 
Eleventh hour dramas are Fhs invariable style. 

Though my mind leaves everything up to Him, my stomach sings a 
different tune. It often heaves like a volcano about to erupt. 

Frankfurt, Germany. Today Dada Kamnananda phoned with news that 
Baba's party has left Calcutta for Bombay and were out of touch; there was still 
no official word about their program. 

"So are they coming to Switzerland or not?" I asked. 

"I guess so, but, but..." 

"There's nothing sure." 

"Right." 

"What about the Central Office?"

"They also don't know what's going on. But dare we tell that to the Margis? 
If maximum Margis are to meet Baba in Geneva they need to start traveling 
now." 

"Yet another cosmic clash. Thanks, Baba." 

For a few seconds neither of us spoke as we weighed the alternatives. 

"We've got to announce that Baba's definitely coming," I said. "Right." 

"It's the only practical thing to do. If we're wrong, that's His problem." "Yah," 
said Karunanandaji, "and maybe about 1000 Margis' problem too..." 

"Anyway, if we guessed right, nobody will ever know." "And if we guessed 
wrong, I'll say it was your fault," he said, laughing. "Thanks." Though I didn't 
know whether or not he was really joking, I also laughed. Why not? 

" I always keep my word" 

Geneva, Switzerland. 6 May. Hundreds of Margi brothers and sisters 
swarmed throughout the Geneva airport today, seething with anticipation, their 
paper-thin patience stretched taut, waiting for a man who was not only the 
center of their lives, but who most had never yet even seen. Some sang 
devotional songs, some danced, while others gossiped but there was no way to 
disguise the tension. Three brothers scaled a wall up to a large window sill, and 
stared through the window looking onto the runway. Even those sitting in 
meditation contributed to the electrifying anxiety. 

For the umpteenth time I rehearsed the security. 

"Volunteers, attennnntion!" I yelled. 

Sixteen uniformed cadets-eight brothers and eight sisters in two perfect 
lines—snapped their backbones straight and thumped their staffs on the floor. 
Though some could barely speak English, all clearly understood the martial 
commands. 

None of them, however, understood one thing: perhaps Baba was not 
coming. I caught Karunanandaji's eye, which flickered as he cast a thin grin in 
my direction. He could still afford to smile. 

If Baba was coming today, the plane now arriving was the only possible 
flight. I stood toward the back of my volunteers, confident that

at least these sixteen would play their role properly if He came. But would He? 

"Baba Nam Kevalam!" screamed one of the Margis hanging on the window 
viewing the runway. "He's here!" 

Those sitting in meditation jumped up. as everyone (including the general 
public) pushed toward the door of the customs and immigration area. 

"You fool!" yelled another Margi on the window. "That isn't Baba." 

A painful groan issued from scores of lips. 

Waiting ... now only silence from those up on the window ... the door from 
the customs area opened, and two passengers came out... then a few more ... 
still no Baba... 

An Indian dressed in white and wearing glasses came out—a brief 
hesitation as many thought, "Is that Him?", and then—"Baba, Baba, Baba!" all 
were yelling, all were running, all were excited to the breaking point—it was 
Him! 

At the top of my voice I shouted, "Volunteers, attennnntion"! but it was no 
use. I was wrong—the cadre did not obey, and instead added to the melee, 
wildly mshing toward their gum. And there I was, standing near the back of the 
hall, while the hundreds of Margis zeroed in on the man I was supposed to 
protect. What an idiot I was! I tried to push my way forward, but others were 
equally desperate. Madness, pure madness. 

For a split second I could see Baba smiling through the crowd, standing 
next to several Dadas and Margis who had come with Him from India. Then 
the stampede hit. Oh God, what were they doing to Him? Adrenaline pumped 
through my veins. I elbowed my way between two Margis, then more, pushing 
myself forward. 

In the front, near Baba, I saw a strange windmill of hands and feet rapidly 
breaking the air, deterring the Margis. Baba Nam! It was Dada Ramananda, 
Baba's personal assistant, jumping left and right, forcefully rebuffing the 
Margis, thrusting them away from Baba. 

Then somehow I was there next to Him. I couldn't believe He was still 
smiling, as calm as the eye of a hurricane. I joined Ramanandaji, driving the 
Margis away, clearing a path for Baba to walk to a chair, next to 
Karunanandaji. 

He walked slowly, majestically. In any case, He couldn't have walked 
rapidly, because His legs were still not fully recovered from the years of 
suffering in the prison. Karunanandaji had a smile like a cherub. 



Eye of the Hurricane

Baba sat. At last the sixteen volunteers recovered their senses and took 
their pre-planned places. 

Baba then spoke His first words, "You see, I have kept my word. Two 
years ago I promised to visit Switzerland at the first opportunity I would get. 
Now I have come. I always keep my word." 

Several brothers and sisters came forward wearing colorful uniforms 
specifically for performing yogic dances. 

Baba leaned toward Karunanandaji and said, "The color of the uniforms is 
not proper. You must take care. Even if an ant dies a premature death, the 
entire balance of the Cosmos is affected." 

"Next time it will be perfect, Baba," Karunanandaji said. 

I smiled. It was Baba in true form. 

Paradise and the invisible wall 

Fiesch, Switzerland. About 700 Margis are present in this scenic mini¬ 
village of chateaus and meeting halls, surrounded by mountains, pine trees, and 
green grass, graced by a shining sun, and bathed in pure air. It seems idyllic, 
especially when I think that Baba is also here. The program will last one week, 
then we travel to other cities. 

In the light of this paradisical atmosphere, one aspect of the Margis' 
behavior certainly appears odd—at least by normal social standards. Their mad 
desire to touch Him has continued unabated since the time He arrived in the 
airport. This tense situation has at least one good result—it compels the 
security team to be on their toes. While accompanying Baba in and out of the 
hall, the volunteers, both brothers and sisters, hold their sticks horizontally, 
creating a sort of mobile protective fence around Him. Baba Himself seems to 
enjoy this frantic game. He sometimes pauses in His walk to smile at certain 
Margis or offer a few encouraging words. In those times the enthusiasm of the 
Margis grows higher, and the volunteers hold onto each others' sticks, further 
reinforcing the fence. In some cases the onslaught is so severe that I also have 
to join in the defense squad, straining against the shoving and pulling. Though 
I am particularly vigilant to see that Baba's movement is undisturbed, I wonder 
whether our efforts at security are so necessary. I observe repeatedly whenever 
we are not swift enough to stop some movement of hands or feet or a 
rebounding stick in Baba's direction, there is an invisible wall that protects 
Him. allowing Him to be totally unconcerned with the chaos only inches away 
from Him.

Daily dramas 

By now I've settled into a regular daily schedule: an early morning meeting 
with the security volunteers, checking meal arrangements for Baba and the 
Margis, organizing the Personal Contacts of different Margis with Baba, 
checking the program in the main hall, seeing to the security at the houses of 
Margis/workers/Baba, etc. The greatest meticulousness is demanded in the 
security for Baba's twice daily field walks and darshans. My own meditation 
time is abnormally short, but I don't care because I see Guru directly many hours 
a day. As for eating, there's even less time, but the Didis in Baba's kitchen 
usually save two or three big spoonfuls of prasad 50 for me which more than suf¬ 
fices. Having almost nothing else to eat, I have near-perfect conditions for 
gauging the phenomenal power of prasad. 

Today while driving to the field walk I listened to the following conversation 
between Baba and Bodhishvar, who is a leading Swiss Margi: 

BABA (pointing to a vineyard): Bodhishvar, what kind of grapes are those? 
BODHISHVAR: I'm sorry, Baba, I don't know. BABA: Well, are they red 
grapes or white grapes? BODHISHVAR: They are white grapes, Baba. BABA: 
Are they good for making wine? BODHISHVAR (smiling): I don't know. Baba. 
BABA (speaking gently): Why don't you know? You should know everything. 
Yes, they are excellent for making wine. Their name is (a Ger 


50 Food touched by a spiritually elevated person is called prasad , In the physical contact of any 
two entities some energy is always exchanged. This is especially so between human beings 
because their consciousness is easily altered by environmental circumstances. The effect ismore 
noticeable when one of the parties is the guru, whose only purpose it to uplift the minds of 
others. If the guru touches an object which is afterward touched by his disciples, they derive 
benefit. Food is the most powerful prasad because the disciple ingests it and metabolizes much of 
its energy. Prasad can also be created by keeping it for a certain length of time in the middle of a 
kiirtan/meditation program. Though prasad is well-known and accepted among yogis, it is only 
recently that scientific experiments began to verify its effects. These experiments, however, now 
come under the category of microvita medicine rather than prasad. Generally microvita research 
is performed with simple water. Later in this book the idea of microvita is elaborated. By the 
way, the opposite of prasad is easily recognized. The reader may also have felt it—when a cook is 
angry or depressed, the diners may become uneasy or sick after eating that food.

man name I don't remember). They are grown primarily in (about four or five 
areas with German and French names that I don't remember). They have a 
specially sweet taste, as opposed to (about three or four types of other grapes 
that I also didn't know). Is it not a fact, Bodhishvar? 

BODHISHVAR: Well, I'm not an expert like you, Baba. 

BABA: No, no. Your Baba knows nothing. (Looking at me also) You boys 
are the ones who must know everything. What do you say? 

(In reply, we simply smiled as charmingly as we could.) 

Every day I choose three or four brothers to enjoy the field walk with Baba. 
The sisters often protest but I am under instructions from Ramanandaji and 
other Dadas to only permit brothers according to the Indian system. The sisters 
have requested that their desire be expressed to Baba many times, but the 
Dadas refuse, considering such a change impossible. It's my opinion Baba 
prefers that new initiatives come from our side, rather than by His direct 
suggestion, so He has had to manage this problem in His own unique way... 

Today, halfway through the field walk. He was resting in a chair with a few 
brothers by His feet (the security and myself remained standing). I thought 
everyone was entranced by the talk, but then Baba turned to Bodhishvar, 
saying, "Bodhishvar, you are feeling sad about something." 

"Yes, Baba." 

"What is it? Say, say." 

"Baba..." 

"Yes, go ahead." 

"It's my wife, Anchala...." 

"Yes, don't hesitate," Baba said. "Say what's on your mind." 

"Well, Baba ... every day I go with You for field walk, and she cries and 
cries. Baba, because she also wants to go ... Can't she also come?" 

Without the slightest hesitation, Baba said, "Why not? 1 ', and beamed as if 
He were just waiting for this question. 

Ramanandaji and I immediately looked at each other with a mixed 
expression of surprise and delight. 

"Thank you, Baba!" said Bodhishvar. 

Later we met with the Didis and set up a new system where the number of 
sisters would equal the number of brothers on field walk. We also made plans 
to add sister volunteers to the security arrangements.

Hiding His knowledge 

This morning, on the way to the field walk, I asked Abaniish of Norway, 
who until five days ago had never before seen Baba, "Brother, what do you 
think of Baba now?" 

"It's funny," he said. "I don't know why... He hasn't done anything at all 
special... He looks and acts just like a sweet old man... I don't know why, but I 
love Him." He gave a big smile like a child. "I feel... I feel love for Him—just 
like a father. No, even more than for my father." 

"It's a normal reaction," I said. "Absolutely normal." 

We drove high into the snow covered Alps. While walking. Baba said, 
"Life on our planet started in these Alps. At that time the surroundings were 
very hot. Life began only up in the mountains at zero degrees centrigrade—the 
necessary temperature for the process to start." 

After walking in silence for a few moments, Dada Abhidevananda asked, 
"Baba, is it possible that life came to the earth from another planet?" 

"Why not? Why not? According to my opinion, life came from the planet 
Mars. Today Mars is a dying planet." 

Later He commented that the first human civilization was also in the Alps. 

We returned to the cars and started back. Just after turning a corner, we saw 
several uniformed persons putting away a big parabolic-shaped machine. One 
of the Margis in my car, an engineer, said. "That's a sound-detection device 
used over long distances by the secret police to pick up conversations." 

Another Margi added, "Do you think it's possible that Baba specifically 
intended that interplanetary talk to be overheard by them?" 

During evening darshan, after a devotional song, one brother suddenly 
stood up in the middle of the crowd. In the otherwise silent room, his words in 
Italian had a shocking effect. Before he could complete even one sentence, 
Dada Japananda rose, pointed his finger at the man, and told him forcefully to 
sit down. Obediently the man collapsed to the floor. I recognized him. It was 
Parimal from Parma. He was previously a brilliant physicist, tragically struck 
by a disease which had neces

sitated an operation on his brain. Since then he had turned abnormal, to say the 
least. 

In the momentary excitement. Baba looked at Dada Ramananda and me. 
(Ramanandaji was sitting next to Baba, while I was standing. After the security 
fiasco at the airport, I had decided to remain close to Baba whenever He was 
out of His room, directly rather than indirectly supervising the volunteers - 
though admittedly I took this decision not solely out of consideration for 
security.) He looked at us and asked, "What is it? What's happening?" 

"Nothing, Baba," Ramanandaji said. "The man is crazy." 

"What do you mean 'crazy'?" Baba said. "Let him come to the front. Come 
on, my boy," He said, waving Parimal forward. 

As he hobbled forward, everyone could see his balding, deformed skull. He 
launched excitedly into an Italian soliloquy. 

Now this will be interesting, I thought. Since Baba knows all the world's 
languages, we should be able to see first hand how H e replies to a tongue that 
He hadn't been exposed to before. All the Margis leaned forward similarly 
watching for Baba's IMtiOfl, 

But it was not to be as we hoped. Instead, Baba spoke to the Dada posted in 
Italy: "Japasiddhananda, give me the translation in English." 

Though everyone was silent, many looked disappointed. They may have 
been thinking. Was it only fiction, this story that Baba knows all languages? 

Japasiddhanandaji started the translation, "Baba, he says the title of his 
story is titled Baba with the Baby on the Farm." 

Parimal appeared inspired as he spoke, enthusiastically dramatizing his 
discourse. I observed that some of the Germans and Dutch looked 
disillusioned, seeing Baba's apparent dependence on the translation. 

But the Italians and those who understood Italian (including me) could not 
help but notice that each time Parimal spoke a humorous line. Baba smiled 
before the translation was delivered. 

[Author's note: Some months later when I visited Parma, Italy, I found a 
changed Parimal. Previous to this experience with Baba, he had been in a near¬ 
constant state of confusion. While I was in Parma, however, I saw that he was 
still excited about Baba—that he was always talking about Baba. Instead of 
being in a state of confusion, I felt he was in a spiritual state. A few months 
after that he died.]

DMC night 

This morning, during the daily meeting of our thirty-five security cadres, I 
had the uncomfortable task of asking for a volunteer to stay and guard Baba's 
house during the DMC speech and varabhaya mudra . 51 

"Whoever sacrifices himself for the welfare of others is guaranteed Baba's 
special grace," I said. "I know you've all come here looking forward to the 
DMC speech. Nevertheless, I'm sure at least one of you will selflessly 
relinquish his rights for the sake of the others." 

My words met only silence. No one moved. A few seconds passed, and 
then one brother stepped forward. It was a young Margi from Ireland. 

"Thank you, Sundara," I said. Honestly, I felt sorry for the lad. 

Usually on DMC day Baba holds a special meeting of avadhutas to discuss 
some interesting matters and to bless us. This evening the answer to one 
question was, for me, especially imbued with mystical significance. 

By then twenty minutes of the meeting had passed and the air was electric. 

"Each avadhuta has a singularly extraordinary role to play," He said. 
He paused and then asked, "What is the purpose of the avadhuta?" 

We could not answer. We could not even speak. 

He gave His own reply, slowly: "The purpose of an avadhuta... is ... to 
exist." 

As all the nuances of this statement gradually sunk into my heart, my spine 
shivered, then shook strongly. 


51 DMC\s an abbreviation for Dharma Mahachakra. Mafia means “great," and "dharma-chakra" 
means group meditation, so DM C literally means "the great group meditation." It consisted of a 
series of formal darshans by Baba over a few days. On the last evening of the gathering, Baba 
would end His discourse with a special mudra, His varabhaya mudra. " Vara" means boon, and 
"abhaya" means fearlessness due to feeling completely protected. So "Varabhaya" can be said to 
mean " blessing of fearlessness, or blessing with protection and without fear," and mudra means 
"meaningful hand gesture." This was the greatest attraction to Dharma Mahachakras. Almost 
everyone felt their consciousness expand dramatically as an immediate result of this mudra, and 
M argis often became absorbed in the supreme state, losing awareness of the external world or 
experiencing ecstatic bliss.

Immediately before Baba gives the daily darshan speech, kaoshiki is 
demonstrated by a few sisters, and then both kaoshiki and tandava by a few 
brothers. 52 

Because it was DMC night I felt something special in the air. Nevertheless, 
the announcement in the dark surpassed my expectation: "Tonight's tandava 
will be performed by one hundred brothers!" Within a single shocking moment 
one hundred torches burst in flames—the dancers leapt high in the eerie light, 
chanting BABA NAM KEVALAM at ear-splitting volume. 

Guru's lips curled slightly in pleasure. His eyes burned, and His body 
shifted into a powerful pose. Soon after, in that mood, He gave the DMC 
speech. 


Late at night, standing outside Baba's house, I heard fragments of several 
Margis' discussions about the DMC. 

"Never before was my mind so concentrated"... "I thought my head would 
break, it throbbed so strongly"... "Well, I felt nothing, but somehow was still 
inspired" ... "He was beautiful" ... "These things are too subtle to be analyzed" 
... and so on. 

Just before I went inside, Amita, a middle-aged lady from Norway, said, 
"And none of you saw it?" 

"What?" they said in chorus. 

"I was sure everyone saw it..." she said. 

"Saw what?" 

"The smoke coming out of His hands during the mudra. It completely filled 
the hall." 

52 Kaoshikii is a yogic dance which helps cure over thirty diseases, while generally exercising and 
energizing the body, it is especially beneficial to women, but also valuable for men. Tandava, a 
powerful jumping dance, stimulates the male hormones—it should not be done by women. It 
was invented by Shiva 7000 years ago. Statues and paintings of Shiva often depict him in this 
dancing pose. Tandava is the only yogic exercise which stimulates all the body's glands. It even 
invigorates the brain. Shiva encouraged his warriors to perform tandava because it also helped 
in rousing their courage. A skull or a snake is held in the left hand while dancing to symbolize 
death. In the right hand a dagger or burning torch is held to symbolize life. The dance is a 
struggle between life and death, between dynamicity and staticity. Of course, life is the victor. 
Baba once said, " You should learn it in a disciplined way. Tandava represents life and vitality. 
Tantra is a cult of life, it is not a cult of death. Y ou should be strong—physically, mentally and 
spiritually. Lord Shiva says that all your expressions, all your manifestations must be based on 
present tense. So Tandava is the starting phase of Tantra.”

Sacrifice paid back 100 times 

Today is our last day in Switzerland. Baba consented to hold a special 
meeting with the brothers and sisters who had worked as security volunteers 
throughout the week. 

All stood at attention, forming a perfect line, facing Baba. I stood in the 
front together with the Didi in charge of the sister volunteers. One brother came 
forward and garlanded Baba with a wreath made of green pine needles. 

"I regret to have troubled you all," Baba said. "You sacrificed your 
comforts. You nobly sacrificed your time for the sake of assisting me and 
serving your Margi brothers and sisters. For this I humbly thank you." 

He spoke a bit more, then slowly walked over to the line. As he passed 
each cadet, He looked into their faces. At the end of the line He came to 
Sundara. Baba removed the wreath from His own neck, placed it on Sundara, 
and then patted the top of his head. At that moment the blood rushed to 
Sundara's face, and he looked so high that I would not have been surprised if he 
had collapsed in spiritual ecstasy. I think he remained standing only out of a 
sense of duty. 

Afterward Sundara said, "When Baba touched me, it was the highlight of 
my life. He paid me back a hundred times over for missing DMC." 

Revealing His knowledge 

Geneva airport. Once we entered the doorway of the immigration hall, we 
were at last free from the emotional mass of Margis. There were fourteen of us, 
eleven from India, plus economist and best-selling author Ravi Batra, 
Karunanandaji and myself. While waiting, Baba sat in a chair. I stood next to 
Him. 

From nowhere, several Italian Margis appeared. Without formality, they 
abruptly sat on the floor at Baba's feet, smiling with full gusto. 

One of them named Vikranta stood up, saying, "Baba, can we sing You a 
song?" 

"You are most welcome," He said. 

Though the melody was sweet, I could hardly follow the meaning— which 
I thought strange in light of my grasp of Italian. I understood only that it was a 
love song. 

Vikranta stood up again, "Baba, I want to explain the meaning in English. 
The dialect is from Venice; it's different from normal Italian." 



Eye of the Hurricane 


192 


Ah, so that's why I couldn't understand it, I thought. As Vikranta gave the 
translation, he visibly savored every moment with Baba. 

Baba's eyes turned misty. He said, "Your song was ambrosial. The 
translation was likewise excellent. E XCellent. But would you mind if I were to 
add a little something to your interpretation?" 

"Oh, please. Baba, yes, yes!" They were excited. 

Then Baba translated the song again, completely, line by line, giving 
detailed and charming explanations for the difference between His version and 
that of Vikranta. 

The plane was called. As we walked away, leaving behind the tearful-eyed 
Venetian devotees, I thought of the difference between this experience and the 
one a few days ago with Parimal. 

Berlin wall and the swastika 

West Berlin. Our field walk today took us to the infamous Berlin wall 
which divides Western democracy from Eastern communism. 

Baba stopped, looked at it, and said, "This wall symbolizes the brutal 
suppression by Communism of human liberties. It is a kind of artificial 
madness. In the near future you will all see this wall crumble piece by piece, 
stone by stone. East and West Germany will be united as one." 

Then He added, "In 1941, Germany came under the influence of a star 
called Magha, a bad star. Magna causes disruption and breaks into pieces the 
object on which its projection falls. Now its effect is finishing, and soon a good 
time is coming." 

After that He explained the swastika. He said the literal meaning of 
swastika is "a condition of goodness which will continue to exist." Thus it 
means victory. He drew our swastika, which He said is positive. Then He drew 
the reverse swastika, and said it is negative. He warned us never to use the 
negative swastika because it brings complete annihilation. The Nazis mixed 
these two swastikas, often using the negative one. 

Conscious sleep 

Timmern, West Germany. About 200 Margis are collected for Baba's three- 
day program in Timmern. 5 ’ The vibration has always been high here but Baba's 
presence has raised it another level altogether. 

53 Timmern is a small village near Braunschweig where we have our local full-timer training 
center.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Several Dadas and Margis were enjoying the talk with Baba in His room— 
until a high pitched sound from the hallway disturbed us. 

What in G od's name is that ? I wondered. 

It grew louder and clearer. "Baba! Baba! Baba!" 

Bodhishvar from Switzerland stood up. "Baba, that's my wife!" 

Shaking His head in the Indian style of agreeing, Baba said, "Yes, she has a 
small problem. But there's no need to worry. Go out," he told him, "and softly 
uttering your guru mantra, hold the thumb of your right hand against her ajina 
chakra (on the forehead), rotating it slightly back and forth for a few seconds." 

After Bodhishvar left the room. Baba said to us, "The explanation for her 
behavior is simple. In her past life she committed an action which terribly 
disturbed her mind. Now she is desperate for any kind of contact she can have 
with me. Though Bodhishvar will succeed in assuaging her this time, her 
intense yearning will express itself again when given the opportunity." 

In that moment the screaming ceased. 

Afterward, I heard that Anchala not only became immediately quiet when 
Bodhishvar placed his thumb on her forehead, she also closed her eyes and 
entered a meditative state. 

In the night, after all were sleeping, Ramanandaji called me and another 
Dada to Baba's room. Just as He was falling asleep we started to massage Him. 
We were silent, deeply enjoying an experience which transcends description. 
After about two hours the other Dada left me alone with Baba. 

At one point, when Baba had been snoring continuously (it was more of a 
soft purr than a snore). He suddenly broke His snore, turned toward me and 
said, "What time is it?" 

"3:30, Baba." 

"Accha," He said 54 , and immediately started snoring again. 

It seems, I thought, that only Baba's body is sleeping, while His mind is 
fully conscious. 

I continued the massage, thinking about this. About twenty minutes later, 
just as I was thinking. Is His mind really a wake? I wish H e 

54 Accha means “ okay' 1 and is common to many of the Indian languages.

Travels with the Myotic Master 


would give me some confirmation..., He again suddenly broke His snore, turned 
toward me, and said. "Who's there?" 

I smiled, saying, "Dharmavedananda, Baba." "Accha," He said. His eyes 
twinkled at me as He chuckled softly. Within a moment He returned to His 
snoring. A ccha, I thought. 

[Author's note: Years later. Baba's adopted son, Kinshukji, commented to 
me: "Though Baba lies down and closes His eyes, He, of course, never really 
sleeps. Rather, whenever He appears to sleep for an extended period of time, 
we all become cautious. We know that He's actually making plans. Usually, 
immediately after that supposed sleep. He introduces new, complex working 
schemes for us."J 

Devotees get their way 

Everyone was talking about it: "We've got to convince Baba to hold DMC." 
"If our devotion is strong enough. He'll have to give DMC." "Timmern is the 
best place for DMC, so why not?" 

Perhaps Baba had started it all when He commented this morning, "Our 
Timmern program is like a mini-Fiesch." 

Whatever the cause, the excitement was so contagious that no one could 
avoid it. 

As we came out for His evening field walk, the Margis crowded both sides 
of the sidewalk, leaning as close to Him as the security volunteers permitted. 
Like a faithful shield. I was close on His heels. 

Baba was shining, immaculate in His white dress. In a clear voice that 
everyone could hear. He said, "It seems a fine night for DMC..." As the Margis 
yelled " Victory to Baba!" and other exclamations of pleasure in reaction to 
Baba's words. He continued speaking in an undertone that only I could hear: 
"...they say." 

I turned toward the Margis, thinking to clear up the misunderstanding, but 
they were so excited they would not have heard me. In the same moment, I saw 
it was Baba's play. 

During the field walk. Baba's mood was different than I'd ever seen. He was 
normally very loquacious during his walks. Tonight, for the first time. He 
walked in silence. 



Eye of the Hurricane 


195 


Our footsteps echoed in the air, the wind providing the only audible 
background to our thoughts. Without the distraction of speech, we sank deep 
into a spiritual mood. 

Halfway through the walk, Baba pointed at some distant tall trees, colorless 
in the faint night light, waving like feather-fans in the wind. "See the Cosmic 
Wave," He said slowly. It was His one and only sentence. 

It was a unique field walk, which in a way I enjoyed more than any other. 

When we returned, we entered the darshan hall. I was shocked. It was fully 
decorated in DMC style, with flowers, leaves, colored papers, a new colorful 
cover for Baba's couch, and a special ornamental arrangement behind the 
couch. The Margis were singing devotional songs in full-throated fervor. 

Even before the speech began, it was clear that Baba was in a special state 
of mind. His demeanor was unusually dignified and transcendental. 

When He spoke His first words, "The subject of tonight's discourse will 
be...", I saw some of the more senior workers cast glances at each other, 
recognizing His common opening for a DMC speech. 

The Margis shivered with excitement throughout the talk, as if an electric 
current was running among them. I waited for Him to give the varabhaya 
mudra (gesture of blessing). 

He never gave it. Personally I didn't care, but I wondered how the Margis 
would react. Had they not all day nurtured an expectation which He had not 
fulfilled? 

Someone asked Him for permission to perform G uru Puja . 55 He agreed— 
surprisingly, as this was usually performed only after DMC. 

I alone accompanied Baba downstairs to His room. When He entered the 
room, He said to me, "Go back up and tell everyone that tonight's speech was 
not DMC, but DMS-Dharma Maha Sammelan. DMS has the same psycho¬ 
spiritual effect as DMC, but the varabhaya mudra is not shown." Just see. Guru 
has to follow His own system; while at the same time the devotees have their 
way to compel Him to follow their own desires. Of course they can only force 
Him up to a certain point. 56 

55 Guru Puja is a mantra sung together with gestures in which the devotee offers his/her 
ego attachments to the guru. 

56 Afterward I came to know that the last, and perhaps only time that Baba had person¬ 
ally held a DM S was in 1962 in Begusarai, Bihar, India. So it is clear that Baba consid-

Travels with the Mystic Maste 


When I went upstairs, I found all the Margis in an exuberant state, singing 
songs and dancing kiirtan. I climbed on the stage, took the microphone, and 
told everyone that I had a message from Baba. After a minute or two they 
calmed down and I repeated Baba's words. 

They didn't care—no one seemed to be affected by my announcement. As 
soon as I finished speaking they immediately resumed their celebration— 
singing and dancing in spiritual ecstasy. 

The sixth point 

Baba's darshan topic tonight was Shiva's Seven Secrets of Success. 

At its conclusion, I took Baba downstairs, saw Him into His room, and then 
entered Ramanandaji's room, just next to Baba's. In a few moments I was 
joined by three or four other Dadas. One sister brought in a huge bowl of round 
milk-sweets, a small fraction of what had been prepared in honor of Baba's last 
darshan in Timmem. I sat alone, thinking of Baba, and eating slowly. 

After eating two of these extremely tasty balls, I was lying on my side, 
looking at the bowl, contemplating whether or not to eat a third one. In that 
very moment, I saw the handle of the door turn and in walked Baba! He was 
dressed in the simple white undershirt and green lungi that He wears only in 
the privacy of His own room. He walked over to me. I sat up, smiling. With a 
sly grin on His face, He said to me, "And remember ... the sixth point is a very 
difficult point to follow." Without giving me a chance to reply, He turned and 
left the room as suddenly as He had entered. 

I lay on the floor, laughing—Shiva's sixth secret of success was control 
over food. 

Freedom's limit 

This morning, just before our departure from Timmem, Baba called a 
meeting of Dadas and Didis. After beautifully reciting a few poems of India's 
greatest poet, Rabindranath Tagore, He asked each of us to express something 
of how we were feeling at the moment. One Dada mentioned how sad everyone 
felt having to leave Timmem. Baba replied by telling a story: 


ered this Timmern program something special. While Baba was in jail, a few avadhutashad the 
duty to conduct DM S. Si nee Baba's passing, DM Ss have been conducted only by the President. 



Lye of the Hurricane

"A great sage Kanva lived alone in a forest. He loved to help people. So he 
often took it upon himself to go to the town, find sick and helpless people, and 
bring them back to his hermitage to care for them until they recovered. He was 
well known for this generosity. One day a mother came to Kanva and left her 
baby girl. Shakuntala, under the saint's benevolent care. Kanva raised 
Shakuntala until she was old enough to be married. At this time King 
Dushyanta arrived, and claimed Shakuntala as his queen. As she was preparing 
to leave, Kanva found himself gripped with feelings of despair. He thought, 'I 
am a renunciate and a yogi. I should be free from the emotions of affection.'" 

Baba asked, "Why was he having these feelings? Although he was a sage, 
he was living in the world, and thus bound by the relative factor. Now all of 
you boys and girls are doing meditation to be free of bondages. Being here in 
the world, however, it is impossible to deny bondage." 

Baba's way of speaking was so gentle that everyone wept. A deer devotee 

Hannover, West Germany. While driving today, an odd event occurred. I 
was in the car just behind Baba's. As the road passed through a field of chest- 
high grass, I saw a deer suddenly emerge next to Baba's car. For about 200 
meters it ran alongside of the car. To do this it had to run at a great speed, while 
at the same time jumping high in the air with each step in order to get through 
the tall grass. At the end of that 200 meters, the car turned and the deer 
followed, continuing to run with Baba for another 150 or 200 meters. Then the 
car accelerated greatly, and the deer fell back, unable to keep up. 

Baba's nephew, Paltu, was in that car. Afterward I said to him, 

"Did you notice that deer?" 

"Of course." 

"And did Baba comment anything about it?" 

"Not directly. But He was surely thinking about it. For several minutes He 
had been discussing German architecture, when, without warning, He began to 
talk about animals. I could not understand why He had changed the topic. And 
then He was talking specifically of deers. The speech on deers must have been 
going on for half-a-minute when that deer appeared. All of us in the car stared 
at it, except Baba, who 



Eye of the Hurricane 


198 


went on speaking without turning His face in the animal's direction. I wanted to 
ask Him about it, but He gave me no scope to speak." 

Will we ever know the cause of this unquestionably mystical event? 

In the light of today's experience and also Baba's story about Kanva and 
Shakuntala I am reminded of an old mythological tale. A saint was alone in the 
forest performing austere spiritual practices. He had detached himself from all 
worldly affairs, and was approaching his entry through the gates of liberation 
when he discovered an orphaned baby doe. Compassion compelled him to 
rescue and then care for the creature. As months turned into years, the doe grew 
into a deer, and without recognizing the change in his mind, the saint gradually 
developed a deep attachment for the animal. One day the deer accidentally 
jumped off a cliff, falling to its death. The saint's heart was tom. A few days 
later his final moment also came and his last thought was of his beloved deer. 
Accordingly, he could not gain liberation, and instead was reborn as a deer, 
which passed most of its life in the company of yogis. 

Perhaps the story is not so fictional after all. 

Revolutionary change 

Yesterday, after leaving the cars, we approached a road having no sidewalk. 

I said to Baba, "In Germany, Baba, since the cars drive on the right side of 
the road, it is better we walk on the left, into the traffic, so we can see any 
danger before it comes." 

Like a child. Baba complied. 

This morning a similar situation arose. Again I started to explain where we 
should walk. 

Baba interrupted me, saying, "I am an excellent student. If I hear anything, 
even once. I remember it forever. I clearly remember each and every perception 
since the moment of my birth. So, thank you—no need to repeat yesterday's 
lesson." 

This afternoon Baba was speaking about society. "As long as there is 
animality in man. there will be war. War is the blackest spot on human 
character. Fight is the essence of life, but war is something brutal.... You may 
expect some change in collective psychology from after the year 1980, and a 
revolutionary change by the year 2000." 



Travels with the Mystic Master 
Heaven in hell 


Rotterdam, Netherlands. A light rain was falling this evening as our 
entourage approached the apartment building which houses our three-story 
Rotterdam yoga center. While still standing on the street, momentarily waiting 
for the local Margi to come forward to unlock the door. Baba muttered 
something which undoubtedly was meant only for my ears. 

He said softly, almost unnoticeably, "What hell is this?" It was not the sort of 
question to which one tries to reply, so I was left wondering about His 
meaning. 

Next day. I believe I now know a little of the meaning of Baba's rhetorical 
question yesterday. To begin with, the stairways in this house are winding, 
narrow, and insufficiently lit. As the two snake-like streams of Margis 
continuously ascend and descend, they unavoidably press against each other. 
Though about one hundred of us squeeze and adjust in inappropriately small 
rooms and hallways, no one minds. There is too much excitement in Baba's 
presence for anyone to care about such matters. 

Nevertheless I am constantly reminded of the spiraling passageways 
entering and departing from the different levels of Dante's hell. 

Then there was the water. It stopped in Baba's bathroom. Since He did not 
complain, it was only discovered when a Margi cleaned His room. For a man 
who bathes three or four times daily, this was a great inconvenience. Yet He 
politely tolerated it. 

After the water was repaired, He commented, "This is the first time in my 
life that I had to use a bathroom without water." 

His silent patience with the clumsiness of our arrangements deeply affected 

me. 


Today Baba mentioned that tandava (Shiva's dance) should be done with 
proper paraphernalia. In the left hand there should be either be a skull or a 
snake to represent the force of destruction or death. The right hand holds a 
dagger or burning torch to represent the power of discrimination or life. He 
specifically added that the snake should be a living, poisonous snake. We took 
this as a cue. Two hours later Melvin was purchased—a beautiful, healthy, 
poisonous snake. 



Eye of the Hurricane 


200 


The next darshan proceeded smoothly until it was time for the brothers to 
perform tandava. Viirabhadra (whose name means "the bravest face of God") 
jumped fiercely up and down and side to side. In his left hand, Melvin violently 
twisted and spit. Some Margis were thrilled while others were horrified as they 
watched the snake bite Viirabhadra's hand again and again. Rather than holding 
the snake just below the head as he should have, he was holding Melvin in the 
middle. Blood began to drip from his hand. Still the dance continued, the room 
reverberated to the chant of 6 aba Nam Kevalam and the rhythmic thump- ing of 
the dancers' feet. Meanwhile Baba entered one of His powerful Tantric moods. 
He looked on with a calm intensity. The snake must have bit Viirabhadra thirty 
or forty times; blood flowed like water dripping from a tap. 

At last the chanting stopped and the dancers halted. Though Baba's words, 
"Very good. Very good," were normal, His voice was deep and penetrating. 
Afterward He said nothing about the snake, but we were sure He was pleased. I 
was concerned for Viirabhadra, but he was inspired to the depths of his being. 
Fortunately the snake's poison sacks had been removed. 

I shall carry the snake with us everywhere from now on. The blood was a 
wonderful touch, but as Tantra has nothing to do with masochism, I will instruct 
the dancers to hold our undulating friend by the neck during the dance in order to 
avoid its fangs. 

On field walk one sister asked Baba, "We have so many complexes like fear, 
shame and so on. How can we get rid of them?" Baba said, "Shall I tell you the 
secret? Kiirtan." 

Next day. Since most of the volunteers here are totally inexperienced, I 
personally had to stand guard-duty just outside the door to Baba's room while He 
was giving Personal Contact. Anchala (the wife of Bodhishvara) was hovering 
around the door, clearly agonized over the impossibility of her entering Baba's

room/ 

At one point I had to use the upstairs bathroom so I requested another Dada 
to cover for me. A few minutes later I heard a loud yell, followed by continuous 
shrieking. The sound came from downstairs. Alarmed, I sprinted forward. The 
screech became louder. Someone ap

peared at the top of the stairs, running toward me. It was Anchala! And the 
scream "Baba! Baba!" was coming from her. She dashed past me. 

Confused, I went down to Baba's room. Immediately several workers 
jumped on me saying, "You fool! You idiot! How could you be so 
incompetent?" and so on. 

"Stop, stop!" I said. "I don't know what this is all about. What happened?" 

"Playing innocent, huh? As if you don't know that Anchala forced her way 
into Baba's room!" 

"What?" I was shocked. I turned toward the Dada to whom I had passed my 
duty. 

"I'm sorry. She was too fast...or, rather, I never expected..." 

"Just tell me what happened." 

"The brother who was receiving Personal Contact finished, and came out. I... I 
wasn't paying proper attention." "Obviously." 

"Suddenly I heard Baba yelling—so loud that I think my hair stood on end. 
He shouted, 'GET OUT OF HERE!' I turned to look through the open door and 
saw Anchala still lying there fully prostrate with her head and outstretched 
arms under Baba's bed. She jumped up like a rabbit hearing a shotgun, and ran 
out." 

"I saw the rest," I said. 

Could this be the last episode in the "Escapades Of Anchala"? Lingua 
franca 

Amsterdam airport. The corridors in this airport seemed exceptionally long. 
Yet Baba avoided using the moving sidewalks and escalators. 

I asked Dada Ramananda if there was any special reason that Baba walked 
up the stairs rather than using the escalator? . 

"He said that escalators make people lazy," Ramanandaji replied. 

While waiting for our plane. Baba told me to sit next to Him. We discussed 
several subjects. One of these concerned some hearsay about which I had 
wondered. 

"Baba, is it true that You will make a world language in the future?" 

57 Until this date, Baba had never given Personal Contact to a woman. It was only some months 
later that He started Personal Contact for women in small groups.

"A language suitable for all citizens of this globe will be constituted, yes," 
He said. 

"Then is it any use for us to learn Esperanto ?" 58 

"There is no need to study Esperanto, because the global language we make 
will be superior. It will be convenient for all peoples. You see, the founders of 
Esperanto, though well-intentioned, committed two major errors. First, it is 
based primarily on European language roots. Asians and others thus feel it 
burdensome to learn. Second, it was propagated mostly among the intellectual 
community. 

"Our lingua franca, on the other hand, will have its roots both in both 
Occidental and Oriental languages, including Sanskrit. No one will feel 
difficulty to assimilate it. It will first be popularized among famous leading 
personalities, so its spread around the world will prove relatively easy." 

The key to our hearts 

Stockholm, Sweden. Since that first chaotic experience of Baba's arrival in 
Geneva when the security went haywire, our other airport arrivals have been 
relatively calm and orderly—that is, until Sweden. A few hours drive south of 
Stockholm lies the only wholetimer training center outside of India and Nepal. 
Considering that these young men and women trainees pass all their time in the 
depths of a serene forest ashram, who could imagine that they would go so 
berserk when they saw Baba? My security forces were completely unprepared 
for the wild and rapid advance they made toward Him, shouting, "Baba! Baba! 
Baba!" Again Dada Ramananda went into action, his whirling arms creating a 
mean defense. But this time it was far from enough. It looked like Baba would 
be swamped in the mad rush of His devotees. Suddenly, as if on cue, though 
indeed it was totally spontaneous, all the workers in the entourage encircled 
Baba, joining hands. Only by a fierce muscular effort were we able to keep 
Him from being swamped. His smile was particularly maddening for these 
trainees, most of whom had never physically seen Baba even though they had 
already fully dedicated their lives for His mission. 


58 Esperanto is a language made by philologists, who hoped it would serve as the language for 
international communication.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Two days later. To a normal mind. Baba's actions often seem illogical. But 
there is a purpose behind every word He speaks, every flicker in His eyes, 
every tilt of His head. What is the explanation behind His odd conduct here in 
Sweden? Due to the presence of the trainees, the devotional wave has been 
high—yet Baba has refused to give darshan for three days. Every morning and 
every evening their hearts pound with anticipation, only to fall into frustration 
and despair each time Baba fails to appear. 

Finally this evening, at the time of His last scheduled darshan. He directed 
His car to drive to the big hall where all the Margis sat. Their happiness when 
they saw Him enter was so strong that many of them wept uncontrollably. 

He keeps the key for releasing our devotional longing by constantly 
varying His behavior in unexpected manners, and by secretly and silently 
touching our hearts, even when we are totally away from His physical 
presence.

CHAPTER 12 


As Per System 


"It's a miracle" 

Valencia, Spain. Because Ananda Marga began here only two years back, 
our local organization is not yet strong. There is no large yoga house. Our 
living quarters and program facilities had to be arranged in a Catholic church 
on the outskirts of the city. 

We arrived in the late evening. Without any experienced local group to 
help, the arrangements were particularly taxing for me. Baba demands 
maximum speed. He instructed me that all workers were to meet in His room in 
one hour. Besides passing along this order, I also had to see to the general 
security, the kitchen, the program plans, the darshan room, and the workers' 
rooms—not to mention dealing with the stream of workers and volunteers who 
bombarded me with questions about their respective responsibilities. 

In the absence of properly experienced security volunteers, I was forced to 
post a guard at Baba's door who was, well shall we say, more occupied with 
spiritual than practical concerns. 

It was almost time for the workers' meeting when a ruckus occurred. 
Running to Baba's room, I saw one of the priests stalking out, swearing to God 
in Spanish, and saying that he would call the police; he wouldn't be restricted 
within his own quarters. He was at least a bit drunk. The guard looked on 
helplessly. I glanced into Baba's room. He was sitting calmly, unperturbed by 
the intrusion. When He saw me He instructed me to call the workers to His 
room immediately. 

Within a few minutes everyone arrived. He said to us, "It is the duty of the 
guest to ensure the host's comfort in every possible way. Our presence causes 
some inconvenience to our host. As gentlemen 




205 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


we are to fulfill our duty in the proper way. We should therefore leave this 
place immediately. We should not stay here another moment." He turned to me 
and said, "Please thank the priests for allowing us to be here for this hour." 

I was dumbfounded. It would be difficult enough to find facilities on short 
notice for such a large group—but add to that Baba's special needs: a room with 
an attached bath, a nearby room for His personal assistant, a call-bell, space for 
darshan, a kitchen for Him plus a kitchen for the workers, etc. The challenge 
was mind-boggling. And it was evening. 

Another priest appeared. The drunkard had been only a subordinate; this 
was the head-priest. I told him we were leaving, and conveyed Baba's thanks as 
directed. He pressed his palms together and said in Spanish, "Please, please 
excuse this great disturbance! Father Carlos was out of his senses. I request you 
to stay on!" 

Hopefully, I passed his words back to Baba. He replied, "Again you must 
thank him, but we have to leave." 

0, Baba... how could You? Ithought. How in the world will we immediately 
find another place? 

Baba was already packed. He started walking with Ramanandaji toward His 
car. It was late night. My mind turned blank in bewilderment. 

Just at that moment the Dada appeared who had made the original 
arrangements to stay at the church. "Perhaps I know a house which will be 
adequate. Your car and Baba's should follow mine." 

I was astounded. "But how is it possible?" 

"I'll tell you later." 

After a half hour's drive we arrived at a suburban duplex. Dada led the way 
upstairs. We entered the room which would serve as His bedroom ... then the 
attached bathroom ... looked at the call-bell... the adjacent room for 
Ramanandaji... the darshan hall, which was adequate, albeit small... 

Baba turned to us. saying with a smile, "It's a miracle that you could get it 
ready so quickly." 

Afterward I asked that Dada, "What's the secret?" 

"Only a mistake," he replied. "I first booked the duplex for our program, 
and even prepared the call-bell. Then the church became available, so I left this 
place. In my haste, I simply forgot about it and neglected to cancel it.

"No, no, that's not the secret," he added. "The secret is that both problems 
and solutions have the same source ." 59 

Typical intricacies 

Notes of all Baba's talks during field walks have been taken by Dr. Patak, 
but this morning the doctor could not come so I was requested to do the note¬ 
taking. Though Baba always speaks informally while walking, I tried my best 
to transcribe word for word. So these notes are special because of their relative 
completeness. They cover three days. These three days' talks were more or less 
typical of His "usual" style, that is if it can be said that He has a usual style . 60 
Notes from the first field walk follow: 

"Why do oranges grow here?" He asked. No one answered. "It is because 
of the Mediterranean climate. The flora and fauna are Mediterranean here. The 
sweet scents here are also due to Mediterranean climate. Roses and sweet peas 
are only scenting in the north. It may be that there are some medicinal herbs 
growing here because the climate is so hot. All of them belong to the Calendula 
family, having yellow flowers.... 

"The name of a small stone or pebble in old Latin is rockin. Similarly a 
small man is mankin in English." 

He requested us to search for a particular herb. It was difficult for Him to 
look for it because His vision was impaired by the poisoning in prison. One 
Dada picked up a leafy plant. "Is this it, Baba?" 

59 The next day Baba mentioned that something similar had happened to Him twice 
before in India. On one of those occasions, He was brought to the home of an ex¬ 
tremely wealthy man. As He entered the house, the owner himself was cooking food 
for Baba. Baba refused to stay, however, saying the man had earned all of his money 
by immoral means. 

60 J ust near the time of publication, I saw a manuscript for another soon-to-be printed 
book called " Shri PR Sarkar on History—a Guidebook for Future Historians". It is based 
on notes compiled by Acharya Ragunath during the field walks of Baba's two-month 
tour of northeast India in 1984. Those informal talks were even more complex and 
academic than the ones He gave in Europe. By the word "informal" I do not mean talks 
which were given without prior research or systematic preparation—because Baba gave 
all of His talks without the slightest preparation. The only characteristic of His so-called 
formal speeches was in His method of giving a series of speeches on related subjects 
over a period of days, weeks or months. On the other hand, His informal talks followed 
no rule. 



207 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"No. this is not the herb which I requested. Nevertheless, this also is a 
valuable herb. It cures liver problems, dysentery, and other digestive ailments." 

He told the herb's name in old Latin, Sanskrit, Russian, modern Latin, old 
Hebrew, and several other languages. One Spanish sister then asked, "And in 
Spanish, Baba?" He looked at her, laughed, and told its name in—Arabic! I 
knew that the motivation of this sister was only to test Baba. 

Baba's bedroom and the darshan room are on the second floor. The weather 
is hot, so the windows are left open. 

Throughout the entire darshan we could hear the singing of Baba Nam 
Kevalam coming from the street outside. After Baba finished darshan and was 
returning to His room, He asked us, "Who was that singing?" 

Bodhishvar stepped forward. "It was my wife Anchala and four other 
sisters." 

"Huh, what do you say?" 

"It is their way of protesting, Baba. Only brothers can receive Personal 
Contact from You. They feel that sisters also should be able to receive Personal 
Contact." 

Baba's face suddenly lost its softness. "No one has the right to make 
demands on me regarding Personal Contact. It is my personal matter. Neither 
can the organization dictate to me, nor can any individual or individuals force 
me to give Personal Contact except as I so please." He raised His voice slightly. 
"Do they have any idea of the inner meaning of Personal Contact? I assure you, 
they cannot understand it. There is good reason why I give Personal Contact to 
some and not to others. Do you know that Shri Aurobindo gave such Personal 
Contact only one time in his life? And that too was while he was standing on a 
balcony, and the individual was down below. No, they do not and cannot 
understand the significance of Personal Contact." 

Without waiting for any reply from our side, He turned and walked into His 
room. Just as we were wondering what to say to each other, the door opened 
and Baba reappeared. 

"Tell those five ladies that they are henceforth permanently expelled from 
the organization. This is my strict order. No one should make any 
representation on their behalf. If any Dada or Didi appeals for 



A s Per System 


208 


them, then that very Dada or that very Didi will likewise be expelled." Again 
He disappeared. 

We were shocked. Bodhishvar said, "Oh, no!" Others said. "It is too 
extreme!" "How could He do this?" Yet there was nothing to do but accept it. 
He left no room for any sort of initiative from our side. 

The girls were still singing kiirtan. Someone approached them, and they 
stopped singing, keen and hopeful to hear Baba's comment. When they heard 
His order, they swooned and wept pitifully. 

How could Baba be so cruel? 

For the rest of the day and much of the night the five of them sat silently on 
the steps outside. 

More notes from this evening's field walk. It was dusk and we were 
walking on a beach outside the city. 

"The old Atlantis is now underwater except for parts of Spain, Portugal, 
Ireland and Iceland." 

Baba suddenly stopped walking, and asked, "What was that?" 

I directed my torch light at our feet. Due to the dark I had not seen it, but a 
small animal had run in front of Baba and now sat in front of Him. 

I said, "A small mouse. Baba. No. A shrew." 

Baba laughed. I felt that Baba knew exactly who that shrew had been in a 
past life, and that the shrew had wanted Baba to touch it, or even kill it by 
stepping on it. Though He refused to do so, I felt He still blessed it. We side¬ 
stepped the shrew and walked on. 

"Dharmavedananda, what is the name of this sea?" 

"Mediterranean, Baba." 

"Why is it called that?" 

"It means middle-earth, Baba." 

"And is it the middle of the earth?" 

"It depends how you look," I said, "since the earth is pear-shaped." "Can 

there be a middle?" "No, I don't think so, Baba." 

"Yes. There can be no middle. But the ancient people thought this was the 
middle of the earth because for them the earth was only Semitic and Alpine. 
There are big waves. Why is that? The Arabian Sea does not have big waves." 



209 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Because the Mediterranean is deep. Baba?" "No. 

Because it is shallow." 

Next day. Notes from this morning's walk: "This hillock is not an ordinary 
place. What is the direction of the sea? Is it not east?" 

"Yes, Baba," replied a Spanish Margi. 

"I remember one old story," Baba said. "In the Medieval stage when the 
Romans—this means over 2000 years ago—when the Roman empire was on its 
pinnacle of glory, they came here crossing the Mediterranean on the east to 
conquer Iberia. A fierce battle was fought." 

He pointed to a concrete slab about 150 meters away. "Perhaps this is the 
place, and that monument commemorates the battle." 

One Margi ran over to the slab, looked at it and ran back. 

"It's true!" he said. "It's a monument about the Roman battle!" 

Though we were all impressed with Baba's omniscience. He didn't pay 
attention to our astonishment and went on speaking like a professor. 

[Author's note: From this point Baba explained at some length about the 
history of the Arab and Moslem movement throughout the world. For readers 
who are interested, this piece may be found in the appendix Technical Talks by 
B aba or with Baba; the article is titled "On the history of the Arab and Moslem 
movement throughout the world". At the end of that explanation He said: ] 

"Strengthen yourselves in north Africa. We will attack from Spain with 
love. But we shall say to them we are not your born enemies. They will say, 
'We hate you.' We will say, 'We love you.' 

"From Gibraltar move southward. Gibraltar is actually Spain, but it was 
given to England as part of a dowry. Historically, ethnologically, culturally and 
economically Gibraltar is a part of Spain. Now, know a little history. Here also 
the Romans attacked Iberia in the B.C. period. But at that time there was little 
difference between Italy and Iberia. The Iberian language is also a part of the 
Latin language, which died out 500 years ago. (I am not sure He said '500' 
years ago.) Regarding Oriental-demi Latin and Occidental-demi Latin: 1300 to 
1400 years ago Oriental-demi Latin became French and Italian; Occidental- 
demi Latin became Portuguese and Spanish. Portuguese is just like a dia- 



A s Per System 


210 


lect. Spanish and Portuguese people each may think. The other is speaking a 
dialect of my language.' In the future, Spanish and Portuguese will come closer 
together and both will be benefited for proper development. Forget the last 700 
years of history—they come from the same stock. The old land of Basque, i.e. 
Spain and Portugal, were a single people.... 

"Roman pirates came from that part. What is the meaning of pirates? Sea 
robbers." 

Fie started talking about agriculture. "What are 

the main vegetables here?" 

I missed writing a few vegetables that Fie said. Then Fie continued 
"...potatoes, beans, brinjals, and onion of white color or gray color? Garlic has 
no seed. But in the case of onion, the seed or root will work. This land is of 
what sort?" 

No one knew. 

"You are cultivators and you do not know? The land is green, and thus fit 
for cultivation of vegetables and fruits of Mediterranean culture." 

One Margi said, "Baba, do you know that here they use more organic and 
natural fertilizers than artificial?" 

"I know the entire agricultural history of Spain. 

"Sweet lemons can grow on the rocky soil here, not oranges. What is the 
difference between the two? The skin and grain of the orange are loose. But 
you cannot easily remove the skin of the lemon. Amongst lemons are sweet 
lemons as big as oranges, which can be conveniently grown on rocky soil. The 
lower portion (He pointed downhill) is suitable for oranges. Up here is good for 
sweet lemon. 

"Is the ground black or a bit red? It is latterite, a bit red—looking like 
brick. There is much calcium in it. It is suitable for sweet lemons and grapes. 
Vineyards are good in the hill area because of the latterite soil. Is this area 
more engaged in agriculture or horticulture? Horticulture. You may get proper 
saplings from Israel of sweet lemons. Are there any pineapples grown here?" 

"No, Baba," someone said. 

"Pineapples may also be successfully grown here in the summer season. 
The winter variety may not grow well here because pineapples can not stand 
chilly climate. There is a ready market for these fruits in 



A s Per System 


north Europe. Now they are imported from far away. In the winter also you can 
grow them in glass houses. This is particularly applicable in southern and 
eastern Spain, and southern Portugal—taking advantage of the fine weather 
during the summer." 

Later in the morning, Baba announced that the expulsion of three of the 
sisters was withdrawn, and that they should be accepted back unconditionally. 
Anchala and one other sister were, however, "to remain indefinitely outside of 
Ananda Marga." Hearing this, Anchala fell into deep despair. She and the other 
sister cried loudly, and tears fell profusely from their eyes. 

Just before evening darshan. Baba asked Ramanandaji, "Have those girls 
properly learned their lesson?" 

"Yes, Baba. They will never again repeat such a mistake. And everyone 
else clearly understands that Personal Contact is your personal affair." 

"Yesss. Then the sentence against the last two is also to be lifted. They may 
again rejoin the organization, if they so wish." 

This evening the five protesters were all on their best behavior: 
sweet and polite to their utmost. Their eyes shone like those of small 
girls. 

[Author's note: Many years later I heard of an incident witnessed by Dada 
Yatishvarananda. It occurred in India preceding the time when Baba started to 
give Personal Contact to women in small groups. All the members of one 
family were devoted Margis. The daughter was adamant that she must get 
Personal Contact from Baba. She sat outside Baba's room performing long 
meditation. Dada said he never saw any Indian sister with such determination 
and fighting spirit. Several brothers were called for Personal Contact. Of course 
she was not called. She continued doing meditation. The Personal Contacts 
finished, and it was announced that all should proceed for Baba's darshan in the 
adjacent hall. Though everyone else left, she refused to go for darshan, and 
instead continued meditation. In the darshan Baba said, "For Parama Purusha 
[Cosmic Consciousness] boys and girls are exactly the same. In the case of 
Personal Contact, however, I give it to the 



A s Per System 


212 


boys directly. For the girls I use a different style." At that moment, everyone 
heard the sister scream "Baba!" Her parents jumped up and ran out of the hall, 
anxious for their daughter. They found her lying on the floor, with a blissful 
expression on her face. Not knowing what to do, they again entered the hall. 
Baba said, "Social conditions compel me to use this style when dealing with the 
girls. When she regains normal awareness, you should massage the joints of her 
body, and then give her hot milk to drink." 

A few hours later, Dada Yatishvarananda asked her what she had 
experienced. She said, "I was very angry with Baba. Due to anger I became fully 
concentrated in thinking about Him. Suddenly my mind soared out of this world, 
and through the Cosmos. I saw all the stars and galaxies, and finally entered into 
ecstasy beyond description. I became one with Baba. So I don't want Personal 
Contact anymore."] 

Next day. Valencia airport. My note-taking continued even without request: 

While waiting for the flight, Baba said, "The Bay of Basque was originally a 
part of Atlantis —that's why it is so shallow. Wherever the sea is shallow, there 
are big waves. The Pacific Ocean is very deep—in some places more than six 
miles deep—and the waves are small in size. The man who knows little talks 
tall. 

"There should be cultural, geological, zoological and other surveys around 
the coast of Iberia, because some new clues may be found about Atlantis. But 
that is only feasible if Iberia gets economic help for the survey from such an 
organization as the UNO, because it requires huge expenditure, and Spain is too 
poor. Physically I come here for the first time, but mentally I have been here 
before. 

"Just after taking a hot drink, you must not take a cold drink. But the 
reverse can be done. The former disturbs the nervous system—the nerve fibers 
cannot tolerate the change. So, rules should be followed in each and every 
sphere of life. Since the time I left the military department in (1940-something), 
I am not wearing socks. It is my system. If I use socks then my head will be 
heated. If I take onion I will feel feverish. Garlic likewise makes me sick. 
Everything must be done as per system. I did not feel any difficulty while I was 
barefoot in the snow in Switzerland—rather my feet were hot. Create a system. I 
did 



213 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


not take any food for 5 years, 4 months and 2 days—and I did not feel any 
difficulty. When the special medical team came from Delhi, the doctor said, 
'Baba's heart is stronger than ours.' There was no shortage of memory, nor 
problem with the brain. My memory is perfect since I was a one-day-old baby. 
I remember everything. All of this is by your grace, by your mercy. 

"For philological surveys, you will have to go to remote villages to study 
the vocabulary used by them. Tape-record their intonation. If you go 
northward from London, you will hear different intonations." 

He spoke the words lake and gold in about ten different British intonations 
proceeding upward from London. 

"You will have to go to villages, undergoing the pain of such travel-books 
will not help much. You will have to study the rocks, the underground and 
above-ground water. Study the language of the bulls—the bovine language. A 
farmer of south India uses a particular commanding tone to bulls. The tone 
used by farmers in England and Scotland is different. And the bulls understand 
only the language of their own comer." 

Baba demonstrated the difference between the tones used in north and 
south India. 

"There are twenty-two pronunciations of the letter 'a' in English, five in 
Spanish, and two in French. You will have to go deep into the source of 
intonation. So philology is not an easy subject. 

"There are many special customs in Spain. For example, bull fighting. In 
Latin bull is torus. Only in Spanish exists the word tor ear, which means bull¬ 
fighting. One constellation of the zodiac is Taurus or bull. The first is Aries, 
which means sheep. The second is Taurus. 

"If I get sufficient time, I may do something to help the cultural life of 
Iberia through Renaissance Artists' and Writers' Association. Due to the 
Ananda Marga organization I hardly get any time. You may form Renaissance 
Universal clubs—it has immense possibilities. And we should try to do 
something regarding the capacity of the vocal chords, through which we 
express our feelings. The scope of talking is less than that of feeling. If you are 
stuck with one pin, you say 'Oh!' If you are stuck with two pins, you also say 
'Oh!' Language fails to express the difference. And if one finger is cut, then too 
you say 'Oh!' Feeling is far deeper than expression. Similarly, one tear drop 
may come in the case of both one or two pins. So tears do not exactly 



A s Per System 


214 


express the feelings either. Tears are physical, 'Oh!' is verbal—such points also 
come within the range of philology." 

Baba explained the names of some Margis present. 

"Liilananda means the bliss that Parama Purusha [Cosmic Consciousness] 
feels when He creates this universe. When He does not create anything He enjoys 
bliss within Himself and is called Nityananda. Liilavatii means the energy which 
dances along the movement of creation. The vital energy used in pleasing the Lord 
is called A rjuna.... 

"In 1969, when I first went to Manila, they sang Spanish songs. There, 
all educated people know Spanish. Before World War I, Spanish was 
the official language. After that the Philippines came under America 
and the official language became English. Most of the Margis know 
some Spanish. Our Filipino acharyas have been posted in South 
America because they know Spanish. 

"Something has to be done now about Esperanto . Before Esperanto 
is established, our people should learn at least broken English as a 
universal link language. It is a necessity. Esperanto had immense pos¬ 
sibilities, but there were no big supporters.... 

"Are there any special arrangements to study Indology or Egyptology or 
Sinology in Spanish universities?" 

One Margi answered. "Maybe in Madrid. Baba. But these things are better to 
study in Germany." 

"In Munich there are several branches of humanities. The first link was studied 
by Max Mueller. He studied Vedic and modern Sanskrit. In his time he was an 
authority." 

On the plane. Even here my notes continued, trying to catch Baba word-for- 
word. 

"The same style of octave is followed in Spain as in the Far East and China. 
Here the music contains a blending of oriental and occidental tunes. Music is not 
of standard European style.... 

"For Iberia, the past was bright, the present is cloudy, and the future is full of 
sunshine. I love the people here very much." 

In relation to the priest who lost his temper while we were in the monastery. 
He said, "A man in missionary service should try to keep his brain cool." 



215 Travels with the Mystic Master 

Doctor Pathak commented that the Spanish word salida is close to the 
Bengali word chalo. 

Baba joked, "In an English class (in India), the teacher said, 'If you wish to 
pronounce cholera with a hard "ch" sound, then Ch-olera chale!" [meaning Go 
away cholera!] 

"The name of the old mixture of Spanish and Portuguese was called the 
Iberian language. Even today, some of the Spanish dialects vary more from 
standard Spanish than from Portuguese. If the European Common Market 
system were extended to all countries of Europe, then Spain and Portugal 
would both be benefited." 

As Baba spoke this sentence I wrote benefitted in my notebook. 

Though He could not see what I had written, He said, "Dharmaved-ananda, 
what is the spelling of benefited!" 

"B-E-N-E-F-I-T-T-E-D," I said. 

"No. Though the rule is that a short sound gets a double consonant, this is 
an exception, and there is only one 't'. There was a man named Rainjan 
Chateijee who had an MA in English, and was very proud of himself. 
Shailapati was not proud. Rainjan spelled benefited with two 't's, and Shailapati 
questioned him. But Rainjan was sure of himself. 

"Shailapati said, 'Okay. You can spell benefited with two 't's because lately 
in Bankipur there has been a number of incidents of dacoity. So two 't's is good 
for security." 

(Afterwards I looked through my notebook and found this to be my only 
careless spelling mistake in twenty pages of notes. Just see how nicely Baba 
caught me.) 

He continued, "English replaced French to lead the world because: A) It 
has the flexibility to accept words of other languages like raja and jungle. B) Its 
grammar is more simple than that of French. The verbs do not change 
according to the number and gender of the nominative case. And the 
nominative does not change according to the gender. C) Book-French and 
people's-French vary with each other. So what should be taken as the standard? 

"See how English ate up Scottish, Welsh and Irish. By the same reasoning, 
Hindi is not popular throughout India due to its grammatical complication." 


(This ends my detailed notes from three days of His informal talks.)

Nothing beyond infinity 

Lyon, France. Though we have a yoga house here, the Margis deemed it 
unfit for Baba's stay. Instead, they arranged a hotel suite for Him. 

Baba hammered His words into Dada Ramananda. "Have I come here to 
stay in a hotel? Am I a bag of luggage to be stored away between darshans? 
Nonsense!" He steamed. "You are the culprit here. You approved the schedule 
and all the facilities. See to our shifting to the jagriti (yoga house) immediately. 
I shall not unpack my bag here." 

I felt bad because it was not really Ramanandaji's fault. 

"But, Baba, there is no attached bath for you there. It will be highly 
inconvenient." 

"It will be highly inconvenient, highly inconvenient," He mimicked in a 
high falsetto. "I am not here for a vacation! I am here to work and be with the 
Margis. If we are not out of here in five minutes..." and His voice trailed off 
into a mumble. 

It was a fact that there was no attached bathroom for Him in the yoga 
house. Setting up a portable toilet next to His room solved part of the problem. 
For bathing, however, He had to walk through almost all the other rooms to 
reach the bathroom near the front door. Margis and workers were of course 
sitting everywhere. Considering that He takes a full bath at least three times a 
day, this was indeed an inconvenience. Yet Baba's mood could not have been 
sweeter. 

Two days later. The Didi in charge of His kitchen handed me a basket this 
morning containing three thermos jugs—water, juice and milk. Because I was 
extremely busy preparing for the field walk, I passed the basket to one of the 
security volunteers, and requested him to bring it to the car. 

During the field walk. Baba drank nothing. After returning. He requested milk. 
Moments later, a distraught Ramanandaji came to me. "What did you do to the 
milk?" "Nothing. What's the matter?" 

"When I offered a cup of it to Baba, He smelled it and said. 'It's gone sour.' 
I've seen this sort of thing before. It happens only when the food or drink for 
Baba is handled carelessly—disrespectfully." 

"But I think Didi, myself and the guard were all meticulous." 



217 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"It was a great problem. When Baba refused the milk, I suggested that 
another cup would be prepared. But He said. It will violate our time schedule. 
So leave it.' This is very, very bad. That's why I want to find the cause. You 
have to check it and report to me within thirty minutes." 

Unable to imagine the cause, I spoke to Didi and the guard, but both 
claimed their behavior had been proper. I sat down to think. A minute later, the 
guard came back, saying, 

"Dada, do you think that anything might have happened because of where I 
put the basket?" 

"What? Didn't you carry it directly out to the car after I gave it to you?" 

"Yes, but no, well in fact, as I was bringing it out the door, I remembered 
my hat. I put the basket down near the door, and ran back to fetch my hat. But it 
was only a minute, Dadaji." 

"Show me exactly where you put it." 

He pointed to the dusty area packed with everyone's shoes. 

I understood, and went to Ramanandaji. 

"This is surely the explanation," He said. 

"Will you tell Baba?" 

"What for? He knows everything. Rather He caused this incident to happen 
just to teach you." 

During the darshan, Baba said, "Suppose that a gentleman is undergoing 
fasting and secretly in a closed room he takes chocolate. The man says to 
himself, 'No one will know! Nobody will know!"' 

At this moment one brother abruptly exclaimed, "Oh Baba!" 

Baba continued, "Not so—his unit cognition will know that I've taken 
chocolate, and similarly the Cosmic Father will also know that in a particular 
room that unit body takes chocolate secretly. That unit body is still thinking, 
'The fact that I took chocolate on fasting day is not known to anybody.' It's 
known to everybody, nothing is secret. 

"Now suppose Anchala is thinking like this: 'This night I will not join 
general darshan and I will sing Baba Nam Kevalam just on the footpath.' But 
Anchala's thought waves will be known to the Supreme Father also. The 
Supreme Father says, 'Ohh! Anchala is thinking like this. Issue a banning order 
saying Anchala won't be allowed to attend general darshan.' Nothing is secret." 



A s Per System 


218 


Afterward I asked the brother why he had reacted so suddenly to Baba's 
words about chocolate. 

"Because He described what happened to me and the exact words I was 
thinking on the last fasting day." 

Following the darshan, Baba said, "Everything in this universe is the 
mental creation of the Supreme progenitor. As long as His mind is there, you 
are within His mind. He cannot say, 'Get out, get out of here! I don't want to 
see your face!' He cannot say this. Because in that case you can ask Him, 'Oh 
Lord, You say, "Get out!", then where am I to go? It would be within Your 
mind." 1 

Now Anchala said, "Oh!" 

Baba looked at her, continuing, '"And, Lord, if You say, "Get out! Go 
beyond the periphery of My mind", then certainly. Oh Lord, You are not 
infinite. Because there is something beyond Your mind. So just to maintain the 
prestige and dignity of Your name. You are to tolerate what I do and what I 
think. And that's why it is Your duty to guide me. Iam Your son, I am Your 
daughter. I am to do according to Your dictates.'" 

Just before evening darshan, several Indian avadhutas and I were together 
in Baba's room when He said, "I am now going to tell a story. But I prefer to 
speak in Bengali. If I were to tell it in English, it would lose some of its charm 
and much of its humor. Do you mind, Dharmavedananda?" 

"No, no. Baba, of course I don't mind." 

"Good. Afterward, Vijayananda will translate the story for you." 

I did get the translation, and will explain below. But during the talk I had 
my own experience. 

Baba was in a chair, while we sat on the floor at His feet. He was served a 
large glass of lemon-water. A cloth napkin was tucked under His chin, which 
made Him look a bit child-like. Since I did not understand much of what He 
said, I paid attention only to His physical actions. As He spoke. He gradually 
brought the glass closer and closer to His mouth. Just as He was about to drink. 
He said something which made the Dadas laugh. He also laughed and brought 
the glass back down without drinking. Continuing. He again moved the lemon- 
water 



219 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


toward His mouth and just as He was about to drink, He came to another funny 
line and, laughing with everyone. He again brought the drink down. He did this 
repeatedly, which made me laugh every time. At the end of the story, the Dadas 
were laughing so hard that some of them were rolling on the floor holding their 
sides. At last He brought the glass to His lips and, giving me a wink, drank the 
entire contents. 

As to the story (keep in mind that this translated version is missing many of 
the subtle Bengali nuances and all of His body-language), it concerned His 
army days before India's independence from Great Britain. Since Baba was a 
corporal, the privates in His platoon frequently complained to Him about their 
selfish sergeant. The food the privates got was very poor, while the sergeant a e 
well and never shared a crumb with them. 

One day. Baba said to the sergeant, "Sir, I know this jungle area well. I 
passed part of my youth nearby. I want to advise you about a most important 
point." 

"Yes, go ahead," the sergeant said. "I'm all ears." 

"There are dangerous jackals roaming here. They are capable of killing a 
man and taking him for supper." 

Opening his eyes wide, the sergeant said, "Then what shall we do? Are 
there any precautions we can take?" 

"Generally these jackals attack in the middle of the night. Before attacking, 
however, they make a slight coughing sound. If we hear that sound, we must 
not alert the animal to our presence by moving. Do you understand?" 

"Corporal Sarkar, I depend on you to get us through this region alive." 

"Don't worry. Sir. For maximum security, it will be best that I sleep in your 
tent." 

"By all means, please do so." 

That night Baba slept next to the sergeant. About 3:00 in the morning, Baba 
woke him up, and whispered, "Listen." "What is it?" exclaimed the anxious 
sergeant. "Shhhh, quiet," He said. A soft cough could be heard. "Is it...?" 



220 


TravelVwith the Mystic Master 


"Yes, it's surely a jackal,He whispered. 

"Oh God! In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit..." 

"Quiet," hissed Baba. 

Another sound was heard. 

"I say! What's that?" said the sergeant. "It seems he's entered my supply 
tent!" 

"Shhh, quiet, Sir, please." 

Then a clicking sound. 

"By God, I think he's getting right into my tiffin box!" "Sir. you'll give us 
away," whispered Baba. "What ho! I can hear the rustle of my bag of channa 
chura (spicy snack)!" 

"Do keep quiet. Sir." 

"I say! It sounds like he's taking my satchel of dried fruits and nuts!" "Sir, 
please." 

"Oh Lord, I'm sure that's the sandesh (milk sweets)!" 

"You'll get us killed, Sir." 

"Oh heaven save me, the cakes!" 

Baba grabbed his shoulders, whispering, "Get a hold of yourself, Sir! 
You've absolutely got to hush up. Don't even move." 

The sergeant lay there, unmoving. But his eyes were filled with horror 
hearing the sounds from the supply tent. At last, there was silence. Ten seconds, 
twenty seconds... 

The sergeant jumped up, saying, "He must be gone! I'll just see..." He ran 

out. 

"Oh, Mother Mary!" he yelled from the supply tent. "That jackal's taken 
every last drop of my eatables! God damn him!" 

Baba walked in, saying, "Sir, really. How can you care for such a small 
matter, when here we stand alive?" 

"Oh damn, damn, damn. You're right, but..." and mumbling beneath his 
breath he went back to his tent. 

Baba looked in, saying, "Sir, better I survey around, to ensure the creature's 
really gone." 

"Very well," sighed the sergeant. 

Then Baba went to the privates' tent to join them in their well-deserved 
feast. 



221 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


During the darshan Baba said. "In the prehistoric world, on this globe of 
ours, the first language that was spoken was about six million years ago. The 
language came, but the intellectual standard was very poor. At that time even 
the forefathers of present human society, those apes and proto-apes, were not 
here. Modern humans came about one million years ago. They had language 
but at that time their intellectual standard was also very poor. As the intellectual 
standard was low, the vocabulary was also very poor. Even amongst the 
developed species of apes, the vocabulary is about 600 words. And in the most 
undeveloped species of humans, the vocabulary is a little more than 900. 
Whereas in the modern French language, the vocabulary is more than 4 lakhs, 
i.e. 400.000." 


Next day. It was 9:00 a.m. I was in the workers' room, resting on my back 
with my eyes closed. Nearly a month had passed, and now only three days 
remained of His program in Berlin Sector. I was exhausted. Thoroughly and 
totally. Having had minimal sleep, minimal meditation, minimal food, and 
maximum stress during this period, I thought, H 0 W can I continue for another 
three days? I love Baba and even love this work, but it's too much. Would that 
this were the last day. I'm sooo tired. I'm too tired to even move my hand. I 
can't even move a muscle. Nothing can possibly make me move now. 

Just in that moment someone said, "Baba!" 

The room rippled with excitement and surprise. Suddenly realizing that 
Baba had entered, I jumped straight to my feet within a fraction of a second. 

Baba walked up to me. He gave me that mischievous smile which shows 
His dimples but not His teeth. Though He said nothing, I distinctly caught His 
thought: Nothing can possibly make you move, huh? 

The great good of deportation 

Milano airport, Italy. June 4. There were thirteen of us in Baba's entourage. 
We passed through immigration procedures normally; all the passports were 
stamped for entry into Italy. 

Just as we were beginning the customs check, an official ran up to us. 
"Please! I'm sorry, please let me have your passports again!" 

Without the slightest idea of the cause of this abnormal treatment, we 
collected our passports and gave them to him. We walked back with 



As Per System 


222 


him to the immigration area, and watched, horrified, as he stamped all the 
passports again. Over the entry permits he stamped 'CANCELED.' He gave no 
explanation and requested us to sit down. 

All of us were running in different directions, talking to any and every 
officer that we could find, trying to get an explanation, and reverse this 
shocking mistreatment. I felt especially responsible because I was the only one 
of the group who could speak Italian. 

After a few minutes of this pandemonium, I suddenly became aware that 
Baba was acting in a way I had never seen before. He was sitting alone, looking 
at nobody, and turning both forefingers and one foot in small circles—surely 
mudras to manipulate the circumstances. The action was similar to that I’ve 
seen done by other Tantrics who were tapping some occult power (Afterward I 
tried to imitate the movements, but could not). I understood that He was in full 
control of what was happening, and wanted it to proceed exactly as it was. 
Knowing that nothing I could do would affect His plan, I straightway sat down 
next to Him. Under the influence of His energy, I became calm and meditative. 

After another hour, we were led to a shuttle bus. Everyone was talking 
excitedly, except for me. I stood next to Baba who appeared completely serene. 
We got on a plane and flew back to France. At no point did any official offer an 
explanation for our deportation. 

When we arrived back at the Lyon airport, I telephoned the yoga house. 
Only one Dada and three full-timers were there. All the other Margis had either 
gone home or were traveling to Italy for Baba's program. Of course that Dada 
was shocked, but he arranged three cars to fetch us. 

While waiting for the cars, I stood next to Baba, offering what little security 
I could provide. 

Ignoring my intention. He said, "Sit down, Dharmavedananda." 

Like a small boy, I happily put my stick down and sat next to Him. As He 
turned to speak to me. He accidentally brushed His hand against my shoulder 
and said. "Oh, pardon me." 

I laughed and said. "You're welcome to do it again. Baba." 

He smiled. I was happy, together with my Baba, oblivious of whatever 
complications we were undergoing. 

"Tell me, Dharmavedananda, what is the great good which will come out of 
this deportation." 



223 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I was surprised at his question. I thought for a moment and then replied, "I 
don't really know. Baba. But I suppose the hundreds of devotees who were 
waiting for You in the Milano airport are now frustrated and disappointed. 
They'll surely feel very bitter toward their own government, and they will better 
understand how corrupt their system is. As a result, they'll be much more 
encouraged to work hard for the establishment of a society guided by spiritual 
morality." 

He said, "Yes, you understand a little something." 

The cars arrived. Baba entered one car and I entered another. For the first 
time in several hours I was separated from Him. For the first time, I started to 
think in a normal way. 

As we drove down the highway toward the yoga house, I turned gloomy. 
My mind sank deep within itself, and in that moment I remembered the thought 
I'd had in the morning while lying on the floor: H OW can I continue another 
three days? Would that this were the last day. Oh. why did I think such a stupid 
thing? Now here it was happening according to my idiotic wish. His flight to 
Bombay was already fixed for the evening. 

I was so sad that I started to weep softly. I thought. Baba, I miss you 
already. Then I thought. Please, You have to give me one last chance to be 
alone with You again. Please, when You call someone to massage You, let it be 
me. This thought ran on uncontrollably until we arrived at the yoga house. 

As we entered, the place seemed deserted compared with how it had been 
when we left that morning. Already most of the decorations had been taken 
down, and in every corner lay the remains of a yet uncompleted cleaning effort. 

Baba entered His room. I sat on the floor alone, alone with my sorrow. 
After a few minutes He came out and went for His bath. 

When He returned to His room, I continued to sit alone, sure that He would 
soon summon me. 

Ramanandaji came out, saying, "Karunanandaji, Baba is calling you for 
massage." 

What was this? I was so much into my own world that I never considered 
He might call another worker. I became distraught and dismayed. 



As Per System 


224 


A moment later though, Karunanandaji opened the door and rushed out 
saying, "Dharmavedanandaji, Baba is calling for you to come also. The electric 
fan is not working for some strange reason, so you should fan Him with, 
with..."He didn't know what to use as a fan. 

I grabbed a newspaper, ran into His room, and started fanning Him with it. 
Meanwhile, Kamnanandaji also came back to do the massage. Baba was in a 
blissful state. I was now as high as I had been down a few moments before. 

At first Baba was in a quiet mood. He began speaking about the suffering 
He and His mission had undergone from the very time of His childhood. But 
His voice carried no resentment. It had all been necessary and ultimately good. 

Then He returned to the present. "What is the cause of this deportation?" 

"I believe the Indian government fed bad information about Ananda Marga 
to the Italian government," Karunanandaji said. 

"Well, it may be, it may be," Baba said with eyes half-closed. Then He 
opened His eyes and said, "But it may be a religious institution." He told the 
exact name of that institution. 

We were both surprised. Though He said "it may be a religious institution," 
we understood Him to mean that it definitely was that institution. 

"You see those priests," He said, "they teach the people to think, 'I am a 
sinner, I am a sinner. Lord, save me, I am a sinner.' Thus they infuse inferiority 
complex. Even if one is not a sinner, praying like this, identifying with sin, he 
or she will become a sinner. Today's young people don't like this approach. 

"Whereas Ananda Marga gives a revolutionary call to the youth. We say 
that everyone should think, "I am the son or I am the daught er of the Supreme 
Father. Lord, no matter what I've done. You have to take me on Your lap.'" 

He was silent for a few moments. Then He sat up, looking serious and said. 
"Why do they fear us?" 

By His word they, we understood He was no longer talking of any single 
religious institution, but rather of all the people and groups that fear Ananda 
Marga. The question was rhetorical, so we didn't try to answer. 



225 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"They fear us because we are better than the Hindus in philosophy... 

better than the Christians in social service ... 

better than the Jews in orthodoxy ... 

better than the Buddhists in morality ... 

better than the Moslems in social equality ... 

better than the Jains in asceticism ... 

and better than the Communists in mobility. That's why they fear us." 

In the evening some of the local Margis came. As usual, a large procession 
formed, accompanying Baba to the airport. But this time He was not traveling 
on another leg of the journey. He was leaving us. 

I was so involved in the arrangements that it again slipped my mind that the 
final moment was approaching. I remained busy until Baba began the passport 
check. Though I was not flying, I somehow managed to enter the passengers- 
only area. 

I walked next to Baba in silence. As each moment passed, I became more 
heavy-hearted. Finally, He and the others entered the gate to board the plane. I 
forced myself to smile at Him. He smiled back and gave a slight wave of His 
hand. Then He turned the comer and was out of sight. 

I walked some distance to where I could be alone and cried. 

Next day. In the mid-morning, completely exhausted from the tour, I 
sprawled out on the floor and fell asleep. Dada Vedaprajinananda told me 
afterward, 

"When I walked by what I thought was a near-mindless Dharmaved- 
ananda. I was surprised to hear you talking in your sleep. You called out. 
'Where can we take Baba tonight for fieldwalk?' 

"Just for fun I decided to answer you and said. We can take Him along the 
Rhone River,' thinking that would be the end of it. 

"But, still sleeping, you replied, 'No, we can't take Him there. He was there 
yesterday!'" 

Today Dada Kamnananda told me, "When we were still in the Milano 
airport, but it was clear that all our efforts would go nowhere and that we would 
surely be deported, I asked Baba: 'Baba, they don't 



226 \ 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


allow us. What we should do?' Baba said, What can we do? We will go back.' 
Then He put His hand on His nephew Paltu's shoulder. He weS a bit tired and 
said, "There's nothing wrong with the people of Italy. There is something 
wrong with the government.' I said, 'Baba, I'm so sorry. We could have 
organized better for You.' But Baba said to me. What did you say? Sorry? Why 
sorry? You should never be sorry. When I was leaving Bombay I decided that I 
would give thirty-five discourses during this tour. The thirty-fifth discourse 
was completed last night in Lyon. So I knew that I would not be able to speak 
further in Verona. Still I came here up to Milano airport. And I am going back 
from here. There is some reason why I came and why I am going back."' 

Confirmation of Baba's 'guess' 

Two weeks later. Mainz, West Germany. The news from Italy: Today 
brother Markendeya and a few other Italian Margis completed their efforts to 
find out the cause of the deportation of Baba's tour group. At an early stage of 
their investigation they were able to confirm that the original request for the 
deportation had indeed come from somewhere inside the religious institution 
named by Baba. 

The official in that institution who conveyed the request to the Italian 
government told them he had only performed his duty, and did not know the 
reason. He was ordered to do so by a higher religious official. The Margis then 
met that higher official. He directed them to an even higher officer from whom 
he had received his order. This upward relay continued until they were led to an 
inner circle around the supreme authority. At this point they were told by the 
very highest official they met. "I am sorry. I am not permitted to give you any 
more information regarding the source or the reasoning behind this process

CHAPTER 13 


Vi sal ess Travel 

Increasing bliss, increasing struggle 

Verona, Italy. August. New news! What a wonderful surprise. Baba will be 
coming to Europe again! And after such a short gap. Maybe He will come 
often. Wouldn't that be a delightful dream! 

Of course, knowing Baba, the struggle I experienced during His first visit 
will only be greater this time. So goes the path of bliss. 

He is scheduled to come first to Greece with a complete entourage on 
September 19th. This time it will be a ten day program. Tonight I already 
started calling all over the continent to begin preparations. I even had to call 
Iceland. 

Hannover. 16 September. Another of His sudden games: at 3:00 in the 
morning I received a call that the timetable for Baba's European tour had been 
pushed forward, and that He is to arrive in Athens the day after tomorrow. 
Three hours later I was on a southbound train together with two other Dadas. 

I almost feel like saying, "This is too much." But I won't because He knows 
what He's doing. 

Next day. Athens, Greece. When we arrived at the station this morning, we 
were met by a new Greek Margi. "Namaskar, Dadas!" 

"Namaskar. What's your name, brother?" "I Giriish! 

Trip good?" 

"It was okay. Traveling is a big part of our life, you know." "Yah hah!" 





Visaless Travel 


228 


"Giriish, you must be excited that Baba is coming." 

'Baba! Oh Baba! Was beautiful!" 

"Yes, it'll be beautiful. I guess you've never seen Baba before, 
Giriish?" 

"Oh Baba! Was so beautiful!" 

"Yes. Is His coming still fixed as planned?" 

"Yes! Coming! Yesterday! Beautiful!" 

"Not yesterday, Giriish. The word is tomorrow." 

"Coming yesterday! Coming yesterday!" 

We ran to the station telephone, and called the yoga house. It was true: Baba came 
and left yesterday! How could this be? 

We walked to the yoga house, still hoping there was a misunderstanding. There we 
met Dada Shaktinath. 

"Yesterday the phone rang," said Shaktinath. "The party said, 'I am Dada 
Ramananda, and we are here with Baba in the airport.' I said, 'Yeah, sure. Who is this 
really?' He said, 'Believe me, I'm Ramananda. We came a little early.' I was shocked, but 
I ran to the airport with two Greek Margis. I was the only Dada here. I was excited, but 
also worried: nothing was prepared yet. Not even their visas. 

"By the time we got there, Baba and all the Dadas and the Didi and Margis in His 
group were outside the airport waiting for us. 

"After we paid our respects to Baba, I asked, 'No trouble with the visas?' 

"'No, no trouble,' Dada Ramananda said. We didn't get any visas.' 

"'What? How did you get out of the airport?' 

"I still wonder that myself,' Dada Ramananda said. 'I had hoped you brothers could 
arrange something for us. But Baba took the initiative. We were waiting inside the 
immigration building when He walked out one door and waved for us to join Him. I 
guess we never would have been able to get the visas. Without Baba's lead we couldn't 
have entered Greece.' 

"Then we took Baba to the yoga house. Though nothing had been properly arranged 
yet, He didn't seem to mind. He was very affectionate. After a few milutes, Dada 
Ramananda told me that Baba would like to bathe and rest. The yoga house was not 
suitable so then we went to Jayanta's house. Though everything was hodge-podge. Baba's 
mood was perfect, and so was the darshan in the evening. Early this morning they all left 
for Egypt." 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


We three Dadas were completely frustrated. We went to the beach for a 
swim. It was my first leisure-break in months. 

When I arrived back at the yoga house, I received a phone call from Dada 
Karunananda. 

"Baba will be arriving in Iceland tomorrow evening from Cairo. You 
should immediately fly there." 

"What? It's not possible! Are you sure?" 

"What can I say? Ramanandaji called me just now with that information. 
I've booked my flight to arrive in Reykjavik this evening. Don't be late." 

"But I've only got about $200, and the flight will surely cost more than 
$ 1000 ." 

"That's your problem." 

When I told the other Dadas, they had a good laugh. 

"There's no money among the Margis here," said Shaktinath. "This is one 
of the poorest units in Europe." 

"There's no time and there's no way you'll make it," another Dada said. 

"We'll see," I said. 

After about twenty phone calls, and the usual incredible coincidences, I 
jumped in a taxi. It was thirty minutes before the departure of the only 
appropriate flight. Brother Sandiip met me at the airport. As he handed me the 
money, he said, smiling, "For me is too much, Dada. But I love Baba." 

"Yeah. So do I," I said, thanking him with a hug. 

Reykjavik, Iceland. We were rushing like mad to get everything ready in 
time for Baba's arrival when the phone rang. It was Dada Ramananda. 

There would be a change, he said. They would arrive the day after 
tomorrow. 

The phone almost slipped from my hand as I thought about the part of my 
fare that was "wasted"—I could have gone by train at least as far as 
Copenhagen, and saved about $500. Well, I suppose this was a good exercise 
for developing surrender in Sandiip. And in me. 



Visaless Travel

Two days later. Even though we had two days to prepare, we were still 
anxiously making last minute arrangements when the phone rang. It was 
Ramanandaji. 

"There's been another change," he said. "We will come tomorrow." 


[Author's note: I later heard the story behind Baba's delay. That morning, 
Baba and His entourage were in transit at the Copenhagen airport. Without 
visas, they could not come out to meet the Margis. By the goodwill of the 
immigration authorities, however, a special exception was granted, and the 
Margis were able to enter the transit area to enjoy His darshan for two hours. 

The plane took off for Reykjavik. But after thirty minutes in the air, the 
captain announced that difficult weather conditions had suddenly developed. 
The flight was diverted to Oslo. 

In my opinion the highest kiirtans of Europe are found in Oslo. I had 
wondered why Baba chose not to visit there. 

Of course, the group had no visas to enter Norway. All the Dadas expected 
to either stay in the transit hall, or otherwise follow the instructions of the 
airlines. Baba, however, was of a different mind. Without consulting any of 
them. He headed for immigration. One of the workers said, "Baba, excuse me, 
we have no visas for Norway, so it will be of no use to go through immigration. 
We might try to speak to the highest authority here." But Baba paid no 
attention. He simply stood in the passport line. Their protests unheard, the 
others also fell into line. When they saw the officer stamping an entry permit in 
Baba's passport everyone was astonished. They could hardly suppress their 
laughter as one by one they were all similarly admitted into Norway. 

Just after the last Dada's passport was stamped, however, the officer 
seemed to wake up. 

"Wait a moment," he said. "Let me see your passport again. ... What's this? 
There's no Norwegian visa! No no, this is very bad. All of you Indians, give me 
your passports back." 

"Ah, but we have friends here in Oslo," said Dada Ramananda. "Before you 
cancel the visas, allow us first to call our friends. Perhaps this can be 
straightened out." 

"This is highly irregular," said the officer. "Wait here."

A higher official was approached, telephone calls were made, and several 
unbelieving, shocked Margis came to the airport. As the negotiations 
proceeded. Baba sat with the Margis and gave a mini-darshan. Eventually it 
was decided that Baba, Ramanandaji, and Didi Ananda Prajina would be 
permitted to enter Norway. The others would have to stay in a hotel arranged 
by the airlines. 

The exuberant Margis and their three guests drove to the house of two 
Margi couples: Manohar and Jyotsna, and Abaniish and Hansa. When Baba 
entered the bedroom where He was to stay, the bed was still unmade from the 
previous night. It seemed He could not have cared less and was in good humor. 

That evening scores of Margis packed into the little house. Though the 
facilities were unsuitable for Baba to give darshan, the air was full of 
excitement and devotion. 

The next morning Baba returned to the airport. In the airport itself He gave 
darshan for one hour, thus fully satisfying everyone. (Even the Dadas who had 
stayed in the hotel were satisfied, having convinced the airline officials to grant 
them free of charge "a few short" international phone calls.] 

Spiritual motivation only 

Baba fixed Iceland as the site for the only DMC program in Europe during 
His tour. Iceland is perhaps the most difficult point for European Margis to 
reach. And it is certainly not considered a resort island. Moreover, there are 
fewer Margis in Iceland than in most other European countries. Though He 
hasn't explained the reason, we guess that there must be a spiritual cause. 
Certainly there is something distinctive about this island of the midnight sun. 
Some mystics have written that Iceland is one of the earth's highest energy 
centers. Though I feel they may be right, I don't really know. But at least Baba 
did say this island is one of the few portions of the ancient land of Atlantis 
which is still above water. 

This reminded me of a story about Baba from some years back. A rich 
Margi had a personal problem and desired Baba's help. When he was admitted 
for personal contact, he secretly carried with him a substantial quantity of gold, 
thinking to offer it to Baba. When he entered Guru's room, he was shocked. 
Rather than sitting on His bed as usual,

Baba was sitting on a huge pile of gold coins. Baba said. "Do you think your 
riches mean anything to me?" The values of the common person and a Tantric 
guru are quite different. 

Upon returning from field walk Ramanandaji noticed some blood on Baba's 
foot when he was taking off Baba's shoes. 

"Baba, what is this? When did You get injured?" 

"It has been troubling me for several days." 

"But Baba, You didn't mention it before." 

Baba did not reply. Ramanandaji picked up the shoe and looked inside. He 
found a nail protruding from the sole. 

"Baba, look at this nail! Why didn't You tell me? We could have fixed it or 
gotten new shoes." 

He smiled. "I did not want to disturb you." 

"So You destroyed Your foot! Oh, look at it! There must have been so 
much pain. Now You disturb me anyway! You should have told me the 
moment the problem came!" 

Still smiling. He said. "Recently I absorbed a large quantity of samskaras 
while giving personal contacts. 61 It was necessary that Prakriti 62 express at 
least a little something in the balance. If I had informed you of the nail in my 
shoe, you surely would have eliminated my discomfiture. But then Prakriti 
would have had to devise another form of compensation." 

Secret connection 

A dozen workers were in Baba's bedroom today, laughing our heads off at 
His jokes. 

At one point. He looked at Dada Rudreshvarananda, who is French by 
birth, and started speaking in his mother tongue. Though the rest of us 
understood next to nothing, Rudreshvaranandaji was so tickled by Baba's 
French mirth, that he literally rolled on the floor in laughter. Later I came to 
know that Baba was making absurd comparisons be 

61 Here Baba refers to the fact that during personal contact He relieves disciples of 
certain samskaras, (reactive momenta or unexpressed reactions) which most impede 
the individual's spiritual development. 

62 Prakriti is commonly defined as "Nature." More precisely it is the operational prin¬ 
ciple causing Cosmic Consciousness to express itself. 



233 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


tween the objects and the people in the room. This French session went on for 
perhaps ten minutes. 

Afterward I asked Rudreshvaranandaji, "How was Baba's French 
pronunciation?" 

"Better than my own. Baba spoke with a perfect Paris accent, whereas I 
was raised far outside of Paris. I think even His vocabulary exceeds mine." 

"But how could He know so much French?" 

"He surely has a secret direct connection with the Cosmic Funny Bone," 
Rudreshvaranandaji replied. 

Lost in His shoes 

Today was DMC day, and brother Jyotishvar from America had an 
interesting experience to recount afterwards. 

"I arrived in Iceland three weeks before DMC. Together with a few others, 
I worked everyday to prepare for the great event. We worked hard painting, 
cleaning, organizing, and furnishing Baba's quarters. Although it was fun to do, 
few people seemed interested in the project, and I wondered if there would be 
much of a turnout for the DMC. However, as the day of Baba's arrival drew 
near, Margis began to appear. 

When the Dadas arrived, they began asking for a volunteer to guard Baba's 
house during the DMC (which of course meant missing the DMC), but 
strangely enough no one was the least bit interested. Even after Baba's arrival, 
no one could be persuaded to take the duty. Dada Dharmavedananda. the 
security in-charge for Europe, asked me to do it. I adamantly refused. I had 
been working on Baba's house for weeks with little support of the local Margis, 
and was frustrated that everyone was coming at the last minute to see Baba and 
was not willing to do any service. Ultimately the Central Dada said I would 
have to take the duty since I had already attended several DMCs. I was very 
upset, and even tried to hire some black-belts from the nearby karate school to 
guard instead of me. But all to no avail. 

By DMC time, I was crazy with anger. I was fighting with everyone. When 
the last person left for the program, the silence became unbearable. I was 
consumed with anger and loneliness, and paced back and forth outside Baba's 
room like a caged tiger. Finally the pain became intolerable, and I burst into 
Baba's room. 



234 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Even though I had helped put the room together, I was stunned by what I 
saw there. The room and all the furnishings were pure white— with the 
exception of the orange lines of a very large pratik (Ananda Marga symbol) 
that hung from the wall, several orange objects that Baba likes to have on his 
night table, and one orange rose in a clear vase. The room smelled strongly like 
perfume, though I doubt any actual perfume was used. The vibration was so 
thick you could cut it with a knife. I approached the bed and smelled Baba's 
pillow; it had a powerful perfume-like smell. Then I noticed one item in the 
room which was not white or orange: Baba's shoes! 

I sat on the floor in front of His shoes in meditation position and stared at 
them. They were black Indian slippers with pointed toes and were very well 
worn on the inside. I wondered, "How did Baba leave the house with no shoes 
on?" 

Then temptation struck, and I put my hands in those shoes and closed my 
eyes. Needless to say, I began to have a very strange experir ence. It was 
disturbed after a few moments, however, by a commotion outside. I hurried to 
see what was going on, which was the least I could do considering I was 
supposed to be guarding the house. I was shocked to find all the Margis 
returning after what could not have been more than ten minutes! What had 
happened? Then Baba's car pulled up as the Margis crowded into the house 
shouting slogans. Had Baba refused to give DMC; why was he back so soon? 

Baba got out of the car and walked toward His room where I was now 
standing dazed and confused, trying to look official without much success. lust 
as he got to His door, he stopped and turned around. The crowd became very 
quiet, and Baba said only this: "I think everyone enjoyed the program?" 

"So he did give the DMC!" I thought. "I must have been lost a long time in 
His shoes." 

Then with the Margis still in a hush, all eyes glued on Baba, He turned His 
head to the left and, face to face, he looked into my eyes and smiled a melting 
smile that said: "You thought you could do something without Baba knowing?" 



235 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


The game called money 

Late yesterday afternoon Baba asked us, "By what route are we traveling to 
Frankfurt tomorrow?" 

Dada Karunananda replied, "We will fly via London, Baba." 

"What? Nonsense! Change the flight! The United Kingdom refused my 
visa application, so I shall not visit there." 

"But. Baba," Karunanandaji pleaded, "we will only pass in transit." 

"It doesn't matter! I won't even touch my toe on that land. It is my fixed 
policy not to visit any country which rejects my visa application unless and 
until that country's government formally invites me.'' 63 

When we left the room, several of us held a quick meeting. 

"The tickets will have to be rebooked via Copenhagen," Karunanandaji 
said. "By that route the additional cost for eleven tickets will be about $5000. 
Where are we going to get that kind of money by tomorrow morning? Our 
account is already finished." 

There were plenty of intelligent ideas between us: 

"Anybody know any millionaires?" 

"We could ask the government." 

"Are the banks still open for negotiating a loan?" 

"We could ask Baba what to do." 

"Look," one of us said, "Baba never tolerates any talk of money-problems. 
Besides, if Fie creates a problem, Fie also has a solution waiting to be found." 

Though not a single good option had arisen, we remained optimistic. A few 
minutes later while I was talking with an older Margi sister, a brother named 
Alexander, whom I had initiated just three days before, interrupted us. 


63 Even at this time some countries were still confused by the Indian government's negative 
propaganda about Ananda M arga. Such countries refused visa applications of any known 
member of Ananda M arga. Three years later I personally met a British immigration officer. He 
told me, "It's quite true that our government's policy was previously to refuse entry of any 
foreign national who was known to be a member of Ananda M arga. Due to recent revisions in 
our information, however, the policy has been revised. Restriction on entry by Ananda M arga 
members no longer applies." The British government eventually became so positive that our 
London kindergarten received appreciation letters from government-affiliated bodies and 
received government grants.

"It sounds like you have a big financial problem, Dadaji." 

"Well, yes, but you shouldn't be worried about it. I'm sure we'll solve it 
somehow." I didn't want this new Margi to be bothered by our problem. But he 
was persistent. 

"How much do you need?" he asked. 

"It's okay. You needn't be concerned." 

"Just tell me, Dada." 

"Ah, about $5000." 

"Well... that's a coincidence. I just sold my house for $15,000. I made the 
budget for spending $ 10,000, and was wondering what I would do with the 
other $5,000. Now I know." 

I objected, but he insisted. 

As we were leaving this morning, Alexander flashed a big smile and said, 
"I feel like Baba created this problem just so I wouldn't use my extra money in 
selfish pleasures." 

I wasn't sleeping! 

According to what others later told me, on the flight to Frankfurt two Didis 
were sitting in front of Baba. Looking back, one of them laughed. She elbowed 
the other, who also turned around and burst out laughing. Baba's curiosity 
aroused. He also glanced back over His shoulder. And there I sat. Due to 
exhaustion I had fallen asleep during meditation. My head was tilted back and 
my mouth was wide open. That mouth has an immense capacity to stretch 
itself. (When I was a child, some of my friends called me Snake-jaw). Baba 
also grinned. 

One Dada said. "How about pouring some water in?" 

A Margi next to me, Mr Rathi, said. "I can deposit a cardamom seed." 

Baba said. "Let's put a rasogula in his mouth." 64 

Rathiji dropped a cardamom seed in my mouth. Rudely awakened, I sat up 
sharply and said, "I wasn't sleeping! I was meditating." 

Everyone exploded with laughter, including Baba. 

Ever grateful 

Frankfurt airport. Because Germany was not in the original tour plan, no 
visas had been arranged. This time Baba did not try to slip through 
Immigration. Instead. He suggested we approach the authorities to grant 

M Rasogula isa popular Indian milk-sweet. 



237 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


an exception. Though an application seemed unlikely to succeed, the guru 
suggested it, so we proceeded. The authorities in the airport immediately 
transferred our request to a higher government body. While waiting for the 
reply, they kindly arranged a VIP lounge for Baba's rest. 

We wanted to provide a snack for Baba. Unfortunately there were no 
cooking facilities so we were forced to order from the catering service. I was 
anxious about how He would react to a commercial food item. I offered Him 
some blueberry yogurt and Baba commenced to eat it directly from the plastic 
container. 

"It's excellent," He commented after the first spoonful. 

"Mighty tasty," He added while eating more. 

"I've never dined on such a succulent yogurt," He said, polishing it off 
completely. He smiled at me. 

This was one of the few times I ever saw Baba eat more than a few 
mouthfuls of a food item. I had never seen Him finish anything before. He 
always left most of His meal for the Margis to enjoy as prasad. 

I felt that He ate all the yogurt just to please me. 

At the end of the meal we received the news that the visa applications were 
granted. 

The customs officer who stamped our passports said. "You are very lucky 
people. Exceptional treatment." 

Baba replied something to the effect that it was not luck. Rather it was an 
indication of the good nature and open-mindedness of the German people. At 
last He said. "I shall be ever grateful to the German nation." 

Double-blessing 

Frankfurt. During the morning field walk. Baba said to me, "Perhaps my 
next trip in Europe will cover four places. Because I want you to remember 
these places, I am giving you a code, Dharmaveda-nanda: DDNN. Finland ends 
in D, Greenland ends in D, Lisbon ends in N, Dublin ends in N. Will you 
remember?" 

"Yes, Baba," I said. "But why did You select these places?" 

"These four will later prove to be hot-points of Prout." 65 

65 Though Baba never again came to Europe, this experience had two values., Besides indicating 
the places where Prout may want to concentrate in the future, Baba also showed me that 
codification is one of the easiest systems to use for memorization. I used this system 
innumerable times since then.

At the end of Baba's informal morning darshan. He permitted collective 
guru puja to be sung (offering of the ego through singing mantra with 
gestures). He usually allows it only at the most important programs like DMC, 
so we were happily surprised. 

During His afternoon field walk in a huge park. Baba suddenly requested 
that we change direction. This was the first time in my experience He had ever 
altered our route. I became upset because about 150 Margis were waiting for 
Baba in a pre-planned spot. Dada Ramananda and some other senior Dadas 
were with them. Hoping to avert a major disappointment, I requested a guard to 
run ahead and inform them of the change. 

Alas, it was too late. By the time we arrived at our new destination, only 
about forty Margis had been quick enough or clever enough to find us. The 
senior Dadas also had not arrived. Surrounded by sweet-smelling flowers, and 
in the absence of the usual officialdom. Baba gave a beautiful darshan. At the 
end one brother requested that we be allowed to do guru puja. 

"It was already performed this morning," Baba replied smiling. 

"Yes, Baba, but may we please do it again?" 

Baba became a little serious, and said, "Once is enough." 

"Please, Baba." 

Baba looked around. If Ramanandaji had been there, he would surely have 
stopped the Margis from pressing Baba. I understood that Baba did not want 
the puja to be done, but I would be endlessly condemned by these Margis if I 
interfered now. 

Perhaps Baba's position was similar to mine, in that He did not want to be 
remembered afterward as being stingy. Or perhaps He foresaw the inevitability 
of this scene, and for that reason had changed our course to avoid the larger 
cast of characters. Or had He all along planned a double-blessing? In any case, 
He finally gave a silent nod, and we began singing. 

During the puja, Baba's usual practice is to return our offerings with certain 
hand-gestures. This time, however, the gestures were different than any I had 
ever seen. Unfortunately most of the Margis had their eyes closed, and did not 
see this special display. But it is my habit never to close my eyes in Baba's 
presence.

Baker's dough 

September 27. This morning before the start of reporting, four of us slipped 
into Baba's room. 

"May we?" someone asked Baba. 

He gave a wave of His hand, and we all started to massage Him; one on His 
right arm, one on His left arm, the third on His right leg, and the last on His left 
leg. As the other workers filed in for the meeting, we four continued ploughing 
into His flesh. 

I remember in particular Dada Sarvabodhananda smiling broadly, showing 
his charming teeth the entire time, his fingers almost dancing on Baba's right 
arm. 

At one point. Baba said, "I feel just like baker's dough." 

Everyone laughed. But we carried on with our kneading. 

Is His apparent pleasure sometimes not real pleasure, but rather just a 
means to allow us to increase our relationship with Him? 

Failure becomes success 

Other than laughing at His joke, I hardly smiled during that massage. 

I was feeling melancholy; this was the last day of Baba's tour. Most of the 
time in Iceland, and here in Germany, I had been busy arranging security, 
darshans, field walks, transportation etc etc. Though I was often with Baba, it 
was usually together with other Margis and workers. I wanted to be alone with 
Him. 

That's why today I decided to stay near His room as much as possible, to 
catch whatever chance might come—even if it meant neglecting my duty. 

Most of the morning and afternoon I was present just outside His door, 
which was almost always open, permitting me to see Him. As the hours went 
by, however, I was slowly consumed with an awkward feeling. On one hand I 
wanted to be alone with Him, but couldn't manage it. On the other hand I was 
disregarding my duties and had no idea what problems might be arising. 

Finally it was time for the last field walk. I hoped it had been organized 
properly without my supervision. But when I accompanied Baba outside I 
found a complete mess. Not only were minor details out of order—even a car 
and several guards were missing. I moved into 



Visaless Travel

high gear to make emergency arrangements, hoping that Baba would not notice 
the chaos. Of course He had to notice—it was obvious to everyone. Today's 
lack of arrangement was a singular fiasco. 

Yet He criticized nothing. In this worst of circumstances. He pretended 
everything was normal. He was even kind to me. 

Was He generous because I was already despondent over His imminent 
departure? Perhaps. But one thing surely contributed to His magnanimity: He 
understood that I was deeply affected by the failure; and that I was determined 
never again to neglect my duty for the sake of a personal desire—no matter 
how sublime that desire might be. 

On the outside, failure. On the inside, success. Every mistake can be so— 
should be so. But when it's your mistake, it's not too wise to tell anybody about 
your inner success. 

If you want to eat more 

Frankfurt airport. After we checked in we found out that our flight was 
delayed. I sat with Baba, undisturbed by anyone else. In the wake of both my 
incompetence and my realization, He fulfilled my wish to be alone with Him. 
At one point in the conversation, He began speaking in a light-hearted manner. 

"Regarding Dr Pathak," He said, referring to the Margi who sat out of 
earshot, "though he is retired, back in India he owned an important clinic. Now 
he believes he is my doctor." Baba used such a tone that it sounded ludicrous. 
We laughed together, like two happy peas in a pod. 

"In fact, I am his doctor, though he does not know it. I told him a few days 
ago, 'You see, doctor, we shall soon be leaving Europe, and going to South 
America. Here in Europe we may find the best cheeses in the world. There, 
however, cheese is in scarcity. So during our sojourn here, you should consume 
maximum cheese.' He followed my prescription to the letter. Now he is 
suffering from belly-ache, due to an overdose of cheese. 

"Can you see all the food protruding from his bulging shopping bag? He 
said he is collecting souvenirs to present his family in India. But we know 
better." 

He paused and stopped smiling. As my chuckling died away. He said, 
"Remember: if you want to eat more, eat less." 



241 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


The flight was called. We stood up to walk toward the gate. "Where are Dadas 
J and N?" Baba asked. I ran here and there to look for them, but couldn't find 
them anywhere. 

Baba was getting worked up over their irresponsibility. He turned to Didi 
Ananda Karuna and said, "When they appear, you should give them a piece of 
your mind." Then He said to one Dada, "You must tell them that they are not 
monks but monkeys." And to another Dada, "You are to make such a hubbub 
that they never forget this august moment." 

Though Baba looked angry, we all enjoyed it. I went to the airlines desk, 
and arranged for an announcement of the two miscreants' names. A few 
minutes later they appeared, running. I rushed to meet them and asked, "What 
delayed you? Baba is furious." 

They grinned sheepishly. "We were looking for white chocolate." With a 
flourish and a show of victory, they whipped several bars out of their handbags 
for me to see. 

I accompanied them to the gate, where Baba and the others were already 
walking toward the shuttle-bus, leaving me behind. As those last two Dadas 
boarded, I could see everyone playing their roles, fiendishly attacking the 
hapless pair. The vehicle started moving. Baba wagged His finger at them, and 
shouted loud enough to make the bus momentarily swerve. 

A few seconds before the bus disappeared from sight. Baba broke His 
scolding just in time to turn toward me. He smiled, and His eyes twinkled as 
He gave me a small wave of His hand.

CHAPTER 14 

Become an Ideal Person 


Better not trouble Cosmic Mind 

Wales, United Kingdom. 1980. Today at the breakfast table, I commented 
to some Margis, "Perhaps I have a special blessing from Baba. In the nine years 
I've been working for Ananda Marga, I've never missed a train, bus or plane. 
Even when I arrive at the station late, the trains and buses in those cases are 
also late." 

"What's the explanation for this, Dada?" a sister asked. 

"Well, it's surely not my own power. If I weren't working for dharma 
(righteousness). I'd miss the bus just like anybody else. Simply speaking, the 
Cosmic Force protects those who serve It." 

"How about some more apple pie, Dadaji?" she said. 

"Sure, thanks." 

"But, Dada," my host, Karun said, "there's no time for more pie now. Your 
train for Liverpool leaves in just twenty minutes." 

"No problem," I said. I ate the pie at a leisurely pace. 

We left after about ten minutes. Since we were late, Karun drove me by 
motorcycle as fast as he could. Still, we arrived one minute past the scheduled 
departure time. We sat down on the platform to wait for the late train. 

Five minutes passed in pleasant conversation. Then as one lady walked by, 
I asked, "Excuse me, do you know how late the train to Liverpool is?" 

"It's not late," she said. "It came on time and left on time." "What?" I was 
shocked. "How can that be?" "I think it's not unreasonable, sir." she said, and 
started to walk away. 




Become an Ideal Person 


243 


"Dada, there's always a first time, you know," said Karan. "I told you not to 
eat that pie." 

"No!" I said, jumping up. "There must be a way. Excuse me again," I said, 
running after the same lady, "but do you know any other way to Liverpool? I've 
got to be there by 6:00 this evening for a lecture." 

"Well, my husband sometimes takes a morning bus to Liverpool. But that's 
surely left by now." 

"We have to try!" I said. "Where does it go from?" 

"It leaves about seven kilometers from here. Straight down that road. But I 
tell you, it's already too late." 

"Thanks! Let's go, Karan!" 

I pulled Karan onto the motorcycle. Even as we rode off, he protested at the 
futility of it. "I tell you, that pie did you in, Dada," he said. "Apple pie yanked 
you off the path of D harma!" 

About three kilometers down the road, we spotted a bus on the side of the 
road. "Stop the bike!" I yelled. 

I ran to the bus. and leapt inside. 

"Is this bus going to Liverpool?" I asked. 

The driver had his head underneath the steering wheel, and was trying to 
see something. "Don't bother me, buddy." 

"Please, just tell me, are you going to Liverpool?" 

"We will, damn it, if this bus ever gets going again." 

I laughed and said. "Don't worry. I'm sure it will start soon." 

lust as I said that, he turned the key and the engine roared. 

As the bus drove off, I stuck my head out the window. "Thanks for the 
pie!" 

Karun yelled at me, "You lucky stiff!" 

Ten days later. Oslo, Norway. I was busy until late last evening, reviewing 
the meditation lessons of a few Margis. Abaniish knocked on my door. 

"You're going to miss your train to Stockholm, Dada," he said. "I never 

miss. Don't worry." 

By and by, I got ready. Once in the car, Abaniish drove like mad. When we 
arrived at the station, Abaniish and the other Margis jumped out and ran. I 
walked. "Dada, hurry up!" 



Become an Ideal Person 


244 


"Baba will take care," I replied. 

But just as the platform came in sight, the train pulled away. 

I stood there flabbergasted. 

"Dada, why didn't you run?" Abaniish said. 

"There's no time for talk now," I said. "Where's the next stop?" 

"Well, Lillestrom," he said. "But it's too far away. It'd be out of the question 
to try and catch up with the train." 

"I don't care!" I said. "We've got to make it." 

I ran toward the car. Abaniish laughed, and came after me slowly. When he 
finally got to the car, he said. "There's no way, Dada. Just admit you missed it." 

But I insisted, so reluctantly he drove. All the way to Lillestrom he kept 
saying, "This is crazy. It's impossible! We're just wasting our time." But I 
pushed him to drive faster. 

Twenty-five minutes later, as we came near the Lillestrom station, we saw 
the train also approaching. "I can't believe it!" Abaniish said. "It's like a 
movie!" 

As the car screeched in, I threw the door open, sprinted to the train, and 
jumped in, out of breath. Then, anti-climactically, the train remained there for a 
few minutes. The Margis jogged up, clapping their hands. 

"Congratulations, Dada," Abaniish said. "Any parting remarks for the 
fans?" 

"Yeah," I said. "Though we Dadas may not have to worry about catching 
our trains, it's still better to arrive early." 

Due to their laughter, perhaps they didn't hear me add. "I got your message. 
Baba. Twice in ten days is enough." 

A great force behind your work 

Reykjavik. I am staying with a family whose daughter works on the 
American military base. Yesterday, when I asked her how I could enter the 
base, she shrugged her shoulders and said. "It's impossible, Dada. Unless 
you've got special permission." 

"Then how do you get in?" 

"I take the staff bus." 

This morning at 7:00 I donned civilian clothes and walked alone to an 
unmarked bus-stop. When the bus came, I boarded; no one asked for either 
identification or fare. I suppose the driver and employees were too sleepy to 
notice me. 



245 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


The bus cleared the check-point at the main gate of the military complex. 
Inside the base, it made a number of stops, dropped off passengers, and 
negotiated two more security posts. At its final stop, deep within this strange 
land within a strange land (treeless Iceland itself reminds me of nothing short of 
the moon), I stepped down. 

I looked around, wondering where I might find my destination. Picking the 
area where the buildings were packed together most densely, I maneuvered 
between jeeps, top brass and sentries. Perhaps because I walked as if I knew 
where I was going, no one questioned me. 

When I had sufficiently penetrated the maze of match-box wooden 
structures and concrete cubes, the moment for my biggest gamble arrived. I 
approached a passing officer. 

"Excuse me," I said. 

"Yes, sir. How can I help you?" 

"I'm a bit lost. Can you tell me where the anti-insurgency training section is?" I 
asked, wondering if there was any such place. "Who did you want to meet 
there?" he asked. Beautiful! "The chief training officer," I said. 

"The man dealing with that material has an office not far from here. Let me 
have a look at your pass to make sure you won't have any problems accessing 
the area." 

Without hesitation, simply depending on Baba, I said, "I don't have any 
pass." 

"What? Then how did you get onto the base?" 

"I just walked here, and no one stopped me." 

"Astonishing! I've never heard of such a thing before! Excuse me, sir, but 
can I know your purpose?" 

"I'm a social worker, and I have an interest in developing a course to 
discipline my staff. I think there's much to learn from military discipline." 

He looked at me intently. "Excuse me for saying, sir, but you look a bit like 
Jesus Christ." 

"Many people say that..." 

"You entered without a pass! I can't get over it. Well, perhaps there's a 
special force behind your work. Let's go to my office. I'll issue you a pass 
myself.” 

After completing the formalities, he telephoned the training section and 
arranged a jeep to take me there. When I got down from the jeep, a soldier met 
me, saying, "Come this way, sir." 



Become an Ideal Person 


246 


He led me to the office of a man introduced as a two-star general. 

"Sir, in what way can I be of service to you?" the general asked 

"I'm responsible for training social workers," I said. "In my experience I've 
found two qualities missing in many of our cadre. One you'll surely appreciate, 
and the other, well I don't know. First, I want my men to be systematic and to 
move together as a disciplined work force. I want to help them kill whatever 
tendencies they have toward disorder. Each of them should develop the ability 
to both lead and follow. Secondly, though I'm not sure you'll like this. I'd like 
them to acquire some of the qualities of the American army's enemy: the 
guerrilla warriors." He stared at me, giving me no inkling of his feelings. "As 
you know better than I, the revolutionary army's make-up is different from that 
of regular troops suited for conventional warfare. Regular troops are usually 
drafted or primarily interested in the economic and social benefits of working 
in the army. Guerrilla soldiers, on the other hand, receive minimal pay. They 
mix with the general population, breathing in and out the problems of the 
common people. They face constant temptation to give up their fight and return 
to the security of normal life. So they must be fully aware, ideological, self- 
willed, creative and, above all, inspired." 

"I'm impressed, Mr ... uh, sorry, what was your name again?" 

"Jackson." 

"... Mr Jackson. Really impressed, both with your straight-forwardness and 
with your sincere intentions. And I do understand. Yes, indeed I do. You've put 
your finger on one of the labyrinthine problems of the military forces—how to 
encourage fighting zeal and individual initiative, while at the same time 
maintaining strict lines of order and discipline. Yes, I'm sympathetic and will 
try my best to help you. Yours is a truly novel approach to social work. Can 
you wait here a few minutes?" 

"Sure." 

When he came back, he had a two-foot pile of books in his hands. We 
spoke a bit more, he praised me again, and ordered a jeep to return me to the 
main gate. From there I took a taxi. Once inside the cab I started looking 
through the titles of the books he had given me. 

Great! I thought. Books on discipline, morale, understanding guerrilla 
warfare, physical training, collective psychology—perfect. But what's 



247 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


this? He must have become over-enthusiastic when I said I wanted to help our 
cadres kill their undisciplined habits—he included a book titled Rifle Training. 

What spoils ecstasy 

Fredrikstad, Norway. I am guiding an adventure-camp here. Last night I 
had a dream: 

I was sitting on the floor in the front of a large auditorium. A few thousand 
Margis were present for Baba's darshan. In the midst of His speech. He turned 
His face directly into mine and spoke to me. 

His sweet words acted like an exotic aphrodisiac, making me lose my head. 
I found myself throwing my arms around His neck. Baba was a magnet of love, 
and I an iron doll. I was so strongly attracted to Him that I unintentionally 
pulled Flim off the stage, and we began to roll on the floor in a tighter and 
tighter embrace. My face was buried in His and I could see nothing. A burning- 
bright white spiritual fire coursed through me. I was consumed by a feeling 
beyond all the joy and sorrow I had ever known. 

In the midst of this ecstasy, a whispering thought entered my mind: What 
will all the people think? 

Embarrassed, I slightly withdrew my face from His. But I still saw nothing, 
because He had caused the lights to turn off. We were in complete darkness, 
and no one could see us anyway. 

Still feeling Him in my arms, I thought. What a fool I was to worry about 
the thoughts of others! 

In that intense bitter-sweetness I awoke. For a long while I lay there— 
awed. 

Every problem is no problem 

Birmingham, England. It was the Sunday night of a weekend seminar. 
Dada Sudiipta approached me around midnight, just as I was about to go to 
sleep. 

"Sorry, Dharmavedananda. I forgot to give you this letter from Dada 
Japananda." 

Dada Japananda, one of my higher authorities, was in dire financial need 
for his work in Africa, and was begging me to bring to India some assistance 
for him. It was a great clash for me, since I didn't have 



Become an Ideal Person 


248 


any extra funds and was scheduled to leave for India the following Wednesday. 
If I had received the letter in proper time, I might have requested donations 
from some of the Margis at the retreat. 

Now everybody must be asleep, I thought, and early tomorrow morning 
most of them will leave. I won't have any chance. What am I to do? Baba, any 
ideas? 

Suddenly I saw the face of an Irish brother who was attending the retreat: 
Sundara. 

M ust be my own imagination, I thought. H e's just a poor student. 

But the image persisted so I walked down the hall. I found all the rooms 
dark; everyone was asleep. Except... in the last room a light was on. I looked in. 
Someone was reading with his back to the door. As I walked up to him, he 
turned to face me. 

"Good evening, Dadaji." It was Sundara. I felt like I was dreaming. 

"Sorry to disturb you, brother." 

"No, no problem, Dada. What is it?" 

"Well, I doubt you can help, but, you see, a Dada needs financial help for 
his work." 

"How much does he need, Dada?" 

"About four hundred pounds." 

"Well, I just received the check from my summer job, but it's back in 
Cork— in Ireland." 

Within a few minutes everything was fixed. He agreed to wire the money to 
me in London on Tuesday. 

No higher purpose 

Back in Calcutta. When I arrived at the workers' meeting today, the 
General Secretary approached me. 

"What's this, Dharmavedananda? You're here again?" he asked. "Who gave 
you permission to attend the workers' meeting? You know only Sectorial 
Secretaries are to come." 

I had wondered when he would notice that I had come to every workers' 
meeting over the last few months. I pulled a paper from my shoulder bag. 
"Please, read this Dada." 

"What is it?" he asked. 

"It's a photocopy of a circular you sent out eight months ago. See point #17, 
please." 



249 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


He read aloud: "All chief secretaries of every trade from all sectors are to 
attend senior workers' meeting every two months. Hmmm ... But not a single 
other chief secretary of any other sector paid attention to this item. It was a 
technical point dictated by Baba." 

"And?" 

"Well... but... everyone understands such a directive is not to be taken 
seriously unless it is repeated. And... well... Dharmavedananda, isn't it 
expensive for you to come to India every two months?" 

"Sure it's expensive. But what do I care if it gives me the chance to see 
Baba? Somehow He always arranges the money for me. Are you saying I 
shouldn't come? Are you going to approach Baba to change the order?" 

"No no." He smiled. Then patting me on the cheek, he said, "Very clever," 
and walked away. 

As long as I'm the Service Department chief secretary I shall attend every 
workers' meeting unless and until I'm specifically ordered to stop. As long as 
duty does not conflict, what purpose is higher than to be with the guru? 

Useless fellow, useless stick 

"Your work is far below the mark!" Baba yelled at one of the senior 
workers of Delhi Sector. "Give some justification, stupid!" 

Usually this Dada was sharp and active. But today he was silent in front of 
Baba, grinning like a five year old boy just complimented by his father. His 
turban was lop-sided, he stood off balance, and in general looked—what can I 
say?—he looked drunk. 

"Idiot fellow!" Baba continued. "Only two schools opened under your 
supervision over the last two months! Don't you deserve punishment?" 

Baba readied His stick. 

"Say, say! Have you become a mute animal? Nonsense, do-nothing 
donkey!" 

Normally, anyone undergoing such treatment from Baba becomes fearful, 
or at least sober. But this Dada's eyes only glittered as he innocently stared at 
Baba. At first we were all a bit uneasy, waiting for Baba's stick to come down 
with a whirring slap. Now the scene took on a comic note. This Dada was 
clearly in another world, enjoying Baba immensely. 

"Foolish fellow. Useless fellow. Leave him to his dream." We all smiled. 



Become an Ideal Person 


250 


In the next moment. Baba was castigating another worker who trembled 
under His onslaught. 

Innovation approval 

Today I approached Dada P, an old worker, with a difficult question regarding 
my meditation. I had discovered a new innovation in my technique, and 
wondered if it was right. Dada gave no clear reply, but essentially discouraged 
me. Somehow I wasn't satisfied. 

A few hours later we were having darshan with Baba on the roof-about two 
hundred Margis were there. During part of the kiirtan, Baba was sitting with 
His face down. Without intending it, I suddenly and spontaneously thought, 
Baba, if I should use this new method in my meditation please look up now. 

In that exact instant. He broke His downward stare, looked up at me, and 
gazed into my eyes for about twenty seconds. Then, without looking in any 
other direction, He again cast His eyes down. 

Could anything be clearer? Without telling anyone, I continued using the 
technique with full inspiration. 

Greatest hindrance to universalism 

Five of us were sitting together with Baba in His room late last night when 
the electricity failed. Someone lit a candle. Baba spoke of mystical matters, and 
then of the future. At one point He asked us a question, "When the spiritual- 
moralists gain power, when they are in a position to directly influence the 
society, what is the first major initiative they should implement ?" 

We speculated for a few minutes but our guesses were all unsatisfactory. 
Baba answered His own question. "The first and foremost change they 
should execute is the elimination of the passport and visa system. This system 
is the greatest hindrance to the establishment of universal kinship." 

Making ideal humans 

In today's reporting session all the district in-charges of the north area of 
the Indian Sector were present. 



251 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


A district in-charge who was about thirty-five years old stood in the front. 
Baba asked him, "Do you know you are suffering from tuberculosis?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Did you seek diagnosis and treatment by a medical doctor?" "Yes, Baba." 

"And did it help?" "No, Baba." 

"Why didn't you take the help of any Dada?" The 

Margi looked down and was silent. 

"And why do you still secretly continue your nasty habit with that lady?" 

Baba's words sent a shock through the room. The Margi quickly shuffled 
his feet and simultaneously sighed. He was so embarrassed that he looked 
ready to die. 

"Do you think Baba cannot see?" 

"No, Baba ... Baba knows everything." 

"Do you deserve punishment." 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Take off your shirt. Yes. Now come closer." 

Baba raised His stick in the air and brought it down with a snapping sound 
below the ribs on the right side of the man. Once, twice, three times. The Margi 
winced slightly. 

"Turn in the other direction." 

He beat him now thrice on the left side. 

"If you correct yourself, and reinvest that misutilized energy in social 
work, you will become a new man. An ideal man. What do you say?" 

He stood up a little straighter and said, "Baba, I will be an ideal man." 

"Eh, what did you say?" 

In a forceful voice he said, "Baba, I will be an ideal man!" "Have you all 

heard his words?" We all said, "Yes, Baba." 

"GS Dada, take my stick. Now, touch it to his chest. Yes, and twist it back 
and forth." 

As the General Secretary turned the stick, the man suddenly took a deep 
and long breath. 



Become an Ideal Person 


252 


"Now do the same at the opposite point of his back." 

Again the Margi took a strong breath. 

"How do you feel now, my boy?" 

"I feel very good, Baba!" 

"Have you had any x-rays taken?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Tomorrow go to the hospital and have another x-ray made. You will see 
that your disease is now 80% cured. It will soon become completely cured if 
you strictly follow the Sixteen Points (of physical, mental and spiritual health). 
What do you say?" 

"I will be the ideal son of Baba!" 

"Yesss." Baba gave a slight wave of His hand. 

After paying his respect, the Margi stepped back into his place. 

Without further ado, as if nothing had happened, Baba continued the 
reporting session. 

Tonight as I sit here writing, I think back that after reporting we all left for 
lunch and hardly a further word was spoken about the incident. This sort of 
experience with Baba is so common that it no longer draws our wonder. For us 
it is no miracle—it is simply one of Baba's ways to increase our commitment to 
Sixteen Points and guru. And for that Margi, well, who can say why he 
attracted Baba's grace? 

The world is the mind 

Goteborg, Sweden. This morning, while taking the ferry from Alborg, 
Denmark, I read one of the Don Juan books by Carlos Castaneda. Though I 
have some doubt about how completely factual his books are. they at least 
partially reflect the mystic teachings of the native Mexicans. Those teachings 
have something in common with Tantra, and I suppose they are derived from 
the ancient Tantra. I became absorbed in his idea that each person's perception 
of the world is simply a projection of that person's own mind—so absorbed that 
I did not notice the clock as the ship approached land. Only when I looked up 
from the book and saw the passengers jammed near the exit did I recall the 
short time I had to reach the train station after the ship's docking. If I waited for 
all the passengers to leave before me, I would surely miss my connection. 



253 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


With my mind still engrossed in the book's idea, that everything I see is the 
projection of my own thought — I stood up and walked toward the back of the 
crowd of waiting passengers. At least one thousand people were there. Though 
I neither spoke nor made the slightest gesture, the impatient packed crowd 
divided for me. They did so keeping their backs to me. It was unnatural—like 
the Red Sea parting for Moses. I was able to move forward without hindrance. 
Just as I arrived at the gate of the ship, it opened, and, without breaking my 
stride, I was the first to walk off. It was like a movie or a dream. I made the 
train just in the nick of time. 

The experience was a minor one. But it's philosophical implications have 
been following me and rippling my thought-waves ever since that sunny day in 
California. 1 


“This refers to the experience in 1969 in Chapter 2. in the entry entitled " No Outside”.

CHAPTER 15 


Lord Shiva Never Did It 


The one and only answer 

Verona. 1981. According to Tantra, there are no accidents. Life is a series 
of incidents, each with its own cause and meaning. 

When I first attempted to analyze the causes behind my mistakes, my 
injuries and the injustices inflicted upon me, I accepted the usual explanation: 
"Wrong thoughts and wrong actions beget painful reactions." And for those 
who practice meditation, the interval between cause and effect is usually short. 

As a spiritualist. I've learned to see every problem as an opportunity for 
growth. I've learned to stop what I'm doing when I make any mistake and focus 
on the source of the error within me. 

Over the last few months my analysis deepened. Behind every personal 
difficulty, I found not only some previous mistake, but more importantly I 
found the absence of Cosmic ideation. Whenever I forgot Guru or God for 
more than a few moments, I hurt someone or hurt myself. 

During these last months, every time I made even the slightest mistake, I 
noticed 1 had forgotten my mantra. 67 Each mistake helped alert me to my 
uncontrolled ego-centered thoughts. 

So, what happened today? While busy in the yoga center, running from one 
activity to another, I was joyously singing Baba Nam Kevalam. At one point, I 
dashed into the bathroom to wash a few clothes. After 


7 The constant internal repetition of one's personal mantra is one of the essenti al Tantric 
practices, it helps to calm the mind of the aspirant and eventually helps to ensconce him or her 
in continuous Cosmic ideation. 




255 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


wetting and soaping my clothes, while still singing, I started pounding my 
soaped shirt in the sink. I didn't know that the sink had not yet been fully 
installed. Suddenly, it tipped over and fell on the floor. As the basin broke, a 
big piece dove into my bare foot. 

The noise alarmed two or three of the Margis, who thrust the door open. 
They found me lying on the floor, stunned. Blood gushed out of my foot. 

The cause of my shock was not, however, what it appeared. While they 
fussed over my injury, I hardly paid attention to it. Rather, I muttered, "I can't 
understand..." I couldn't grasp how I could make such a blunder even though I 
was singing Baba Nam Kevalam. Suffering may happen while one is in Cosmic 
ideation, but careless mistakes cannot. 

It doesn't figure... I thought. 

Then a flash. I jumped up, almost slipping in the pool of blood. "I've got 
it!" I blurted out. The Margis' eyes bulged as they stared at me, thinking I'd 
gone nuts. Crazy or not, I had the answer: Though I'd chanted spiritual words, 1 
hadn't been aware of their meaning. It had only been a jolly tune for me, 
without any feeling. My thoughts had simply raced, immersed in me—only me. 

A psychic implosion! Feeling alone is the key to harmony. Actions and 
words may be sublime, but if the feeling behind them moves in another 
direction, there's no value. Though many times I heard or read such philosophy, 
this simple careless accident was the clear proof. 

No need to engage in complex psychological interpersonal mind-games. No 
need to fret over conflicts between a thousand do's and don'ts. Only remember: 
Him. The one and only Answer. 

Even at the hospital, as the doctor completed sewing the stitches, I 
contemplated His grace. When the moment of truth arrived, i.e. the time for 
paying the bill, I said, "Considering that I'm a monk, any discount?" 

The doctor paused, then said, "I hope you learned a lesson from this 
accident. Will you be more careful next time ?" 

"Definitely, Baba," I said. I felt like Baba was speaking through the doctor. 

"Okay," he said, smiling. "It's free, sir." 

I looked at what shall surely remain a nasty scar, and thought, "My little 
beauty, may you serve as a constant reminder, like a string permanently tied on 
my finger." 



Lord Shiva Never Did It

The thing of church 

Warsaw, Poland. I am the first worker to visit this country. Though I've 
been here only a few days, I received the following surprising comment from a 
newly interested person: "I like Ananda Marga very much, Dada. And I'm sure 
many Poles will have the same feeling as me. I predict that within a few years, 
thousands of people will be practicing meditation in this country." Indeed, 
their interest in parapsychology is far beyond what I imagined before coming 
here. 

Nevertheless, the common person's knowledge of spiritual terminology 
appears shockingly limited. A typical communication-hitch occurred last 
evening when I spoke with a few young people. The concept of G od arose in 
my talk. 

"What G od is?" one of them asked. 

"Well, how do you define it?" I replied. 

"I have idea not. I know this word not." 

I was surprised. His English was not perfect, but at least he should have 
known the word. 

"Does anyone here understand the word G od?" 

They all shook their heads. 

"Gocf is the endless energy, the beginning, the end, the purpose, the mind 
of our minds. All the religions talk about God...." 

"Oh!" One of them interrupted me. "The thing of church, you mean?" 

"Well, that's one way of defining it." I said, laughing. It was 

both very funny and very unfunny. 

Budapest, Hungary. Last night I wanted to go to a graveyard to do my 
kapalika meditation. The young artist who was my host guided me to the 
nearest cemetery, and left me there unceremoniously a little after midnight. 

When I entered, I was astonished to see tombstone upon tombstone. There 
were so many thousands of them that they leaned against each other. They 
careened in every conceivable direction, bordered by waist-high grass. Even in 
the daytime I would have found it difficult to make my way to the center of the 
tangle. Many stones were cracked or covered by moss. Even for an 
experienced graveyarder like me, it was spooky on this cloud-covered night. 



257 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Since I was keen to withdraw my mind from these surroundings, my 
concentration peaked more quickly than usual. 

In the morning, during a Spartan breakfast, I asked, "Are all the graveyards 
in Hungary so small and crowded like the one I went to last night?" 

"Oh, that one is special," the artist said. "It was for Jews." 

I raised my eyebrows. "Was?" 

"When Jews couldn't move their homes." 

He meant the ghetto. 

"They couldn't go outside their area, but they still had babies. They still died. 
More and more and more. And no place to go." "And now where are they?" "A 
lot went to Israel. And a lot died. A lot." 

Cosmic confidence 

Belgrade, Yugoslavia. After a successful three-week tour in Poland, 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, I arrived last night in a communist country where 
I can wear my uniform. I breathe a relative freedom here in Yugoslavia which 
was absent in those other regimes which suffer under the heavy hand of their 
Overlord. There, I find the people believe in socialist theory, but despise the 
dictatorial presence of the Soviet army, and the strangle-hold maintained by the 
Soviets over their education, international trade, spirituality, culture and mass 
media. 

My decision to risk wearing my uniform in Yugoslavia was influenced by a 
comment Baba made some time ago, that Tito's government would not obstruct 
Ananda Marga. 

I stepped out of the train in Belgrade without an address or phone number. 
As usual in this situation, I went to a crowded section of the city, arriving 
around 11:00 p.m. 

No doubt I was an eye-catcher. Many people stopped to inquire if I needed 
anything, but no one had any extra space in which I could stay. Several people 
offered to pay for a hotel room, but I politely refused. 

One of the couples spoke to me in fluent English. "We wish we could help 
you. It's so late, and soon no one will be here. But we have no room." 

"Don't worry," I said. "At the right moment someone will come along. I'm dead 
sure. Really don't worry. It's just a tiny test for me." As they walked away, they 
looked back anxiously. 



Lord Shiva Never Did It 


258 


Five minutes later, they returned. The young lady said, "Your extraordinary 
confidence inspired us. So we came back." 

"We decided to stand here until you find a lodging," the man said. "We'll 
also help you in asking people passing by." 

"Thanks," I said. 

As we stood there waiting for the right person, they asked about meditation 
and yoga. Eventually one of their friends came. Fie had a spare room, and we 
all went there. By the end of the evening we already had the base for our new 
meditation unit. 

And so it goes. Everywhere. 

The great analysis 

Calcutta. August 2. Since June, for the first time in Ananda Marga's 
history. Baba has been calling all workers and Margis from all sectors to 
Calcutta. I arrived today. In total, several thousand people have come or will 
come. 

The program is called dharma samiksha. Samiksha means "analysis", so 
dharma samiksha means "analysis of one's adherence to the right path." During 
dharma samiksha, Margis and workers stand one-by-one in front of Baba, and 
He comments on their good and bad behavior. The Sixteen Points for physical, 
mental and spiritual development is especially relevant to this analysis. I was 
allowed to stay in the room continuously, so I had the opportunity to witness 
many cases. 

Brother J from the Netherlands, who I've known for two years, stepped 
forward. Baba sat on His couch, looking over His shoulder at the wall. 68 

GENERAL SECRETARY (GS): What is his name and posting? DADA 

FROM EUROPE: He is J, district in-charge from Holland. GS: Who is 

your acharya? J: Dada Maetreya. 

GS: What work did you do over the last six months? J (nervously): I arranged 
nine initiations, opened one People's Night School, and started one Spiritualists' 
Sports and Adventurers' Club. 


“Baba rarely looks directly at anyone. When He does, we feel a special energy or shakti. Indeed 
a single glance from Him is often enough to satisfy any M argi who may have traveled thousands 
of miles to meet Him. 



259 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


GS: Acha. Are you following 16 Points strictly? J: Yes. 

GS: How about your meditation? 

J: Yes, Dada. 

GS: How about fasting? 

J: Yes, Dada. 

BABA: GS, ask him about food. 

GS: Are you taking only sentient food? 69 
J: Yes, Dada. 

BABA: Eh? What did he say? 

GS: He said "yes''. Baba. You are not taking any static food? 70 
J: No, Dada. 

BABA (turning to look just over J's head): Eh? What nonsense are you 
speaking? 

J: No, no. Baba. Only sentient food. 

BABA (slightly angry): Tell the truth! 

J: No, Baba, I... ah ... oh. Baba... 

BABA: Do you deserve punishment? 

J: Yes... 

BABA: Stretch out your palm. (J holds his right hand palm-up in front of 
Baba.) How many shall I give you? 

J: Ah... ah ... 

BABA: 10, 20, 30...? 

J: 20, Baba. (Using His stick. Baba strikes J's open palm ten times.) 

BABA: Stretch out your left palm. (J does so, and Baba strikes it ten times 
also.) You must never again intentionally harm your body. Do you understand? 
J: Yes, Baba. 

[Baba then explained a number of points to J about improving his 
meditation and service activities.) 

BABA: Now stand straight. (He sweeps His eyes from J's feet to head, and 
down again.) Vijayananda, make a note. 

DADA VUAYANANDA: Hah, Baba. 71 


69 

Sentient food isfood which isgood for both bodyand mind. 

70 Static food isfood which is harmful for either body or mind. 
Hah means" yes".

BABA: Karmasana, Gomukhasana....[and some other yoga postures I 
forget.] (Speaking to J:) Afterward learn them from Vijayananda. Now come 
close, my boy. (J approaches Baba, who opens His arms, and then embraces J, 
taking him on His lap.) 

J: Oh, Baba! (He starts weeping.) 

ANOTHER DAD A (after a lapse of a few moments, speaking softly): 
Come, come... 

(J leaves Baba's lap. He lies on the floor in front of Baba, hands stretched 
out toward Him in the traditional position of respect to the guru. After a few 
seconds, he gets up, and moves toward the door.) 

GS: Next. 

After a few more dharma samikshas, we all left Baba's room. Brother J 

approached me. "Dadaji, may I speak to you?" "Of course." 

"I have to tell someone, or I'll burst." "My ears 

are open." 

"When Baba pressed me, I denied eating any bad food. I was just too 
embarrassed to tell the truth in front of all the Dadas and Margis there. As for 
Baba, I knew that He knew, and also that He understood why I was lying, and 
even I'm sure He did not mind, because He knows our inner motivation. But, 
well. I've got to tell someone." 

"Go ahead," I said, "I'm your brother." 

"Well, three weeks ago, I was feeling so much clash. I was fed up with 
everything that was happening to me. Out of an impulse, I went to a take-out 
restaurant and purchased a box of fried shellfish. I ate them alone in the yoga 
house. Afterward I felt so bad I vomited." 

I laughed loudly. 

His eyes opened wide, and he said, "Dada, how can you laugh? What I did 
is very bad." 

"Perhaps, but it's not the end of the world. We've seen mistakes a hundred 
times worse." 

"Really?" 

"Of course. And anybody who's spent much time around Baba gets used to 
it. This is Tantra. Up a lot and down a little, up a lot and down a little..."

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Compelled to help 

Yesterday Dada Parameshvarananda arrived from the Philippines for 
dharma samiksha. He had been suffering from leukemia for a number of 
months. The doctors had declared it incurable, though they did not say how 
much longer he would live. 

Three days ago, on the day of his planned departure for India, he fainted 
and did not recover for several hours. By that time, his office secretary had 
canceled the flight reservation. When he regained consciousness, Dada became 
angry at his secretary. "Why did you cancel my flight? You should have forced 
me to wake up, and put me on the plane. I'd rather die in India than here." 

He flew the next day to Calcutta, suffering all the way. Though he had 
never asked Baba for anything before, this time he could not help but think. 
"Please, Baba, help this body." 

From the Calcutta airport, he took a taxi alone. When he arrived at the 
Central Office, he found Baba's Personal Assistant. Dada Ramananda, standing 
at the gate. 

"Baba told me to wait for you here and bring you to His room." 

"But how did He know I was coming just now?" 

"In the same way He knows everything," replied Ramanandaji, helping him 
upstairs. 

Dada entered Baba's room and prostrated. 

"How are you?" Baba asked. 

"I'm fine." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Yes, Baba. I'm fine." Thinking that Baba knows all, he saw no reason to 
express his problems. 

"Yes. Yes. Very good," said Baba. "Now I'm busy, so I will see you again 
later." 

Today it was Manila Sector's turn for general reporting. Paramesh- 
varanandaji came forward. 

"Yesterday," Baba said. "I asked this boy how he felt. He told me fine, 
even though this fool will die within 24 hours. He has a disease which is so 
advanced that it cannot be cured, and will kill him by tomorrow. (Turning His 
face toward Parameshvaranandaji. He continued) Stupid, idiot, why didn't you 
tell me long ago about your prob

lem? If you had told me even six months ago, I could have simply prescribed 
certain yogic postures and diet to cure the problem. Now, scoundrel, you are 
going to die." 

"Baba, please save him," "Give him another chance," said a few workers. 

For a moment. Baba sat in silence. "It is true that he has given his 
everything for my mission. He never cared for himself, only thinking for me. 
So ... Iam compelled to help him. In this case, medical science is incapable, 
impotent. The only means of assistance is spiritual power. Alright. I will save 
him from the jaws of death." 

Baba began lightly touching Dada with His stick. He gradually tapped it on 
every part of his body. At the same time, He narrated Dada's long medical 
history; how he had suffered from typhoid fever, another time from mild 
tuberculosis, and so on. Afterward, Paramesh-varanandaji told me that some of 
the diseases Baba mentioned he had forgotten, but all were 100% correct. 

"I always took care of him, though he didn't know it," Baba said. "In 
natural ways, I saved his life repeatedly. But this time, his irresponsibility is 
excessive and extreme." 

Baba held His stick against Dada's chest. For forty minutes, Baba pressed 
the stick, not moving it from that spot. Dada later said that at that time such 
power entered him that he felt he could easily cross mountains. 

"Now I have purified his body. I withdrew all the cancer cells. He was 
scheduled to die within 24 hours. But his time has been extended. Within ten 
days he will recover all of his previous strength." 72 

Even Lord Shiva Never Did It 

Today Baba mentioned that dharma samiksha is a one-time affair. D harma 
samiksha on such a grand scale was never done before by any spiritual master, 
and Baba will not do it again. He is showing a little bit of His meticulous 
guardianship and a little bit of His intimate knowledge of each and every 
Margi, personally and specifically, one by one. He said, "7000 years ago. Lord 
Shiva thought to conduct such a program, but never did it." 


72 From that moment, Parameshvaranandaji started feeling much better. Ten days later, doctors 
declared him fully cured. 



263 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


I wonder: why never before? And, even more curiously, why never again? 
Is it because Baba did not come to prove Himself to the world, but rather only 
to get His work done? 

Yes, even Lord Shiva never did it. This sentence expressing Baba's 
uniqueness could be applied to much more than dharma samiksha. I think of 
5000 songs...an organization of both renunciates and family people in almost 
every country of the world...the Prout movement...the systematization of 
Tantrathe mixture of intense spiritual practice with social action...His detailed 
guidance in many diverse fields.... Unfathomable. 

Treat him very well 

One of the Margis receiving dharma samiksha today was Rajpal, an Indian. 
At one stage of the analysis. Baba said. "You have a question for me, isn't it?" 

"Yes, Baba," he said. "About my son..." 

Though in that moment, Baba did not give him time to continue, he 
afterward explained to us that he intended to ask about the cause and cure of 
his son's attitude toward him. Almost since the boy's birth, the son had scorned 
and mistreated his father. It was Rajpal's greatest worry, because he dearly 
loved his son. Even though the boy began practicing meditation at the age of 
fourteen, he still expressed disgust toward his father. 

The problem was not a public one, and therefore Baba could not have heard 
of it. Nevertheless He said. "I know. I know everything. The world is 
mysterious. That which happens today may be the result of events occurring 
long ago. In your present life itself you will find the cause of your present 
trouble. Many years ago you took a 500 rupee loan from an old man who was 
not wealthy. But you did not repay that loan, even when the old man was sick. 
Do you remember?" 

"Ah ... yes ... Baba." 

"That old man was very angry at you. and he finally died still feeling angry 
at you. He was reborn as your son. So your son hates you. Otherwise his 
behavior is gentle toward everyone else. Now what shall you do?" 

"I don't know. Baba." 



Lord Shiva Never Did It 


264 


"You must treat him very well. Give him solace whenever possible, serve 
him in sickness. Whatever he needs, give it to him. Beyond that, the only 
remedy is meditation." 

Long range words 

The treatment that Baba gave to Keshava from Germany was peculiar. 
After the General Secretary took Keshava through a typical set of questions & 
answers about 16 Points, Baba proceeded to speak to him in Sanskrit. Keshava 
didn't mind; he understands very little English anyhow. Some of the Indian 
workers who could understand Sanskrit said that Baba was speaking about the 
law of action and reaction. At the end of the session, Baba took Keshava's head 
in His hands, and, rubbing it affectionately, said in English, "My poor boy ... 
my poor boy 

No one could understand the meaning of this, including Keshava. 
Nevertheless, Keshava was so inspired he decided to go for acharya training. 

[Author's note: Keshava became an acharya, and then an avadhuta with the 
name Gunaragananda. In 1991, I spoke again to Gunaraga-nandaji about his 
dharma samiksha. His bewilderment about the meaning of Baba's words "my 
poor boy" was apparently resolved when he had a serious car accident while in 
the Sweden acharya training center. He nearly died in the accident, and needed 
many months to recover. Severe scars remained. I say "apparently resolved" 
because a few years later, as an acharya, he had another accident in a car in 
Venezuela, in which the car flipped over several times, killing the driver. 
Gunaraganandaji was thrown a few meters away from the vehicle, even though 
he had been sitting in the back of the two-door car. Again it took months for 
him to get back on his feet. Hardly had he recovered when there was another 
incident. This time it was in Ananda Nagar, where he wandered into the jungle 
far away from our central quarters, fell asleep after doing meditation, and was 
attacked by tribal people. They stabbed him repeatedly and stole the little 
money he had. 

He told me, "Baba's words in dharma samiksha helped me to keep going 
ahead even during these worst experiences. I accepted the suffering as a part of 
my spiritual path. I believe that during dharma samik

sha Baba foresaw my death, and changed it into a series of accidents, which 
allowed me to go on working for the mission."] 

Not your fault 

Brother G from the United States stood in front of Baba. After some 
personal talk, Baba said, "Your mind is unnecessarily disturbed about the past. 
You made some mistakes of a sexual nature." 

G's face suddenly became very red. 

"Yeah ... yes, Baba," he mumbled. 

"When you were younger you had some misunderstanding about the 
relationship between men and women." 

He stared at the floor, saying, "Yes, Baba." 

"But it was not your fault. As a little boy you were simply influenced by 
your environment." 

G looked up at Baba. He sighed deeply, smiled slightly and said, "Thank 
you, Baba." 

"No need of thanks," Baba said. "I merely convey to you the unadulterated 
facts. You were unaware. Unaware." 

G approached me after the session, wanting to get something off his chest. 

"I never told anyone, Dada," he said, "but since you were present today, I 
want to tell you that... that before joining Ananda Marga, I had ... improper 
sexual relations." 

He watched for my reaction. Seeing none, he continued, "Even though I've 
been doing meditation for a number of years, it's always bothered me; I've 
always felt guilty. But now Baba's freed my mind. When He said it wasn't my 
fault, something let go inside me. I feel so light now; I wouldn't be surprised if 
I started to fly!" 

Another episode from dharma samiksha: 

BABA: Throughout your life you have had one obsession, one greatest 
fear. What is it? 

MARGI: Ah ... (apparently confused and unable to reply) 

BABA: In your previous life you were a priest of common status. His duty 
kept him fixed at one temple. He often thought, "How can the idol I worship be 
God? God cannot be limited to a statue. So how 



Lord Shiva Never Did It 


266 


can I find God?" He studied and searched for the answer. But one morning, 
before he could come to a clear understanding, a snake bit him as he was 
picking flowers to offer to the goddess. Lying in the grass, in great pain, he 
thought, "If there is a God He must save me. Or at least He must properly guide 
me in my next life." Thinking that, he died. That is why you are here today. 
And that is why you feared snakes so much that you even imagined snakes 
where they were not. But from today, that fear will no longer trouble you. 
Now, my boy, are you satisfied? 

MARGI (smiling): Yes, Baba. Very very much. 

My dharma samiksha 

I stood before Baba for my own dharma samiksha. After passing through 
the normal preliminaries. Baba commented, "He has some sincerity, but it was 
better before." I was mystified by this statement. 

While analyzing my physical condition. He said, "There is weakness in 
your Vishuddha Chakra. 73 " The asanas He prescribed were almost completely 
different from what I had expected. This was because I gave little importance a 
minor operation I had on my knees when I was sixteen years old, and to some 
weakness in my waist—but it seems Baba considered these defects to be 
critical. 

The most beautiful element of my session, however, was something I am 
unable to adequately describe. It was how He looked at me and how He 
touched me. His eyes penetrated far into my soul. From that moment until even 
now as I record this memory, I have been feeling an extraordinary sort of 
ecstasy. Toward the end, He embraced me in such a way that every cell in my 
body burned with excitement. I lost consciousness of everything except Baba 
Himself. I was so happy that my mind stopped functioning except for the 
thought Baba, Baba, Baba. I'm not sure how long I had been sitting in His lap, 
when I suddenly became aware of someone pulling me off of Baba, saying, 
"Come on, others are waiting, you know." I fell into prostration in front of 
Him, and then had a hard time struggling to stand up because my mind was 
almost out of touch with my body. 

73 The fifth chakra, located in the center of throat 



267 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


[Author's note: Years later I add two comments in retrospect. First, I still 
cannot understand what He meant by my being "better before." Did He mean 
my meditation, my dynamism, my devotion, my work, all these things, or 
something else? I don't know. In any case the effect of His words is that I 
always feel like I do not express my full potentiality, no matter how much I try 
and no matter what I do. And yet I don't feel any inferiority complex because 
Baba did not compare me with anyone else, only with my previous self. Thus 
His comment has never stopped pushing me. 

Second, though I had no recognizable trouble with my throat before my 
dharma samiksha, I have often had problems with it ever since. J 

Important to us, unimportant to Him 

Dada A, born in the Philippines, received dharma samiksha. When Baba 
referred to A's secret weakness, he became so agitated that he soiled himself. 
All of the Dadas in the room saw a little bit of his diarrhea drip onto the floor. I 
suppose he had stomach trouble, and could not control himself. 

Baba's personal assistant, Dada Ramananda, said quietly in Bengali, "Baba, 
the boy soiled himself." 

But Baba seemed not to hear. He went on dealing with Dada A. 

After a minute, the General Secretary said something similar to Baba. 
Again Baba paid no attention. Some of us whispered between ourselves. But 
Baba continued, unruffled. 

When at last He took Dada A upon His lap and lovingly hugged him to His 
breast, Ramanandaji spoke again in Bengali to Baba about the feces. Baba lost 
His smile, and replied in Bengali, "What? Why didn't you tell me before? 
Immediately clean up the floor! He must not stay here another moment! Nasty, 
nasty!" 

Two Dadas pulled Dada A out of the room, though he didn't care-not only 
because he hadn't understood the Bengali, but also because Baba had finished 
the dharma samiksha, and blessed Dada A with His embrace. Rather Dada A 
was so ecstatic, he must have been unaware of his own dirtiness. 

We all laughed into our hands. I loved Him even more for pretending not 
to hear until the session was finished.

You win 

Madhusudan, who was my guide in Mokamo during my field training in 
1972, stood in front of Baba for dharma samiksha. 

BABA: If you are following 16 Points you should step to the right side. If 
you are not strictly following, step to the left. (Madhu begins moving right.) 
Wait. Do you have a shaoca manjusa? (A small bottle containing water, which 
is used for cleaning oneself after passing urine.) 

MADHU: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: But do you use it regularly? 

MADHU: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: No, it is not true. You have not been regular in usage. MADHU (in a 
strong firm voice): Yes I was! (He again starts stepping right.) 

BABA (to other workers): Do not allow him to move right! MADHU: But 
I'm following 16 Points! 

BABA: Two days ago you were in Patna at Dag Bangla Charaha Crossing 
at 9:30 in the morning. You passed urine but did not use your shaoca manjusa. 
Is it not? 

MADHU (laughing loudly): You win, Baba. (He steps left.) 

BABA (smiling): Just see, just see. 

A secret revealed leads to freedom 
Brother M stood before Baba. 

BABA: Before becoming a Margi, were you a worker for the Communist 
party? M: Yes, Baba. 

BABA (chuckles, then says): How was the character of your fellow 
workers? 

M: Very bad. Baba. 

BABA (a little indignant): And what about your character, my boy? 

M: My character was good, Baba. 

BABA (a little angry): Tell the truth. 

M: I've made no such mistake. Baba. 

BABA: You are lying. 

M: No, I'm not lying, Baba! 

BABA: Come forward for atonement. (As M slowly begins stepping to the 
front, Baba leans forward with His stick.) 



Lord Shiva Never Did It

M (slightly stepping backward): No, Baba! I did nothing! BABA (in a strict 
tone): Turn around, and look to your rear. M (Turns his face around. He sees 
something which we do not see): Oh, Baba! 

BABA (in a threatening tone): Need I say anything more about hat happened on 
1st April? M: No, Baba! (He throws himself in prostration at Baba's feet.) 
BABA: That will not suffice. Come to your feet. (M stands up. Baba beats him 
several times.) 

Afterward, when M was asked what he saw, he said. "Didn't you all See 
her? When I turned around, I saw my lady friend dressed in a black sari. She 
was a secret, burning in my heart." Then he smiled, saying. "But now I'm free." 

Beyond criticism 

Sister Aruna from northern Sweden stood before Baba. After going through 
the formalities of her name, duty, and so on, the General Secretary began 
asking her about 16 Points. 

Baba interrupted, saying, "There's no need to question her about her 
conduct. She is trying her best." 

We were all astonished. This was the first case of any Margi being declared 
uncriticizable. 

I looked at Arana's face. Instead of noticing the expansion of ego that such 
a comment would have caused in almost anyone else, she looked 
unselfconscious—her eyes glistened with tears. She was lost in the ecstasy of 
being with her Baba. 

The flow of dharma samiksha has been different from Personal Contact. 
Over the past few years I saw many reactions to Personal Contact. My own 
Personal Contact was a case in point. But every dharma samiksha without 
exception resulted in unparalleled inspiration. Baba's remarks were so 
individualized, both in rebuke and in praise, that each Margi was fully satisfied. 
The majority of us could confirm that He knows our most closely kept secrets, 
and knows every wave of our mind and body. I am sure that each and every 
Margi thought something like, "He cares for me. He loves me." 



Lord Shiva Never Did It

In the last weeks. Baba gradually became sick. Today, August 24, the strain 
of altering our mental and physical condition reached the limit. He announced 
that the dharma samiksha program is now finished. 

Conflict with a dancer of darkness 

Lucknow. After the flood of feelings generated by dharma samiksha, 
today's experience served as an ideal epilogue. But first something about 
yesterday. 

Yesterday I left Calcutta by train for Delhi. Shortly before Delhi, a bridge 
collapsed; how, I never came to know. From that point on, the train moved 
backward to access a different route. But the speed was so pathetic that a 
distance which ought to have taken one hour took over twenty. At one rural 
station, while having a brief walk on the platform, I heard a sudden mixture of 
shouts and screams. Rocks flew through the air. The women and children ran to 
get back into the train. Not having the vaguest idea of the cause, I joined the 
ladies in retreat. As I jumped inside, I looked back in time to see a rock strike a 
man in the forehead. The scene was dotted with tiny pools of red blood. 

As the ladies madly pulled down the iron shutters on the windows, I asked, 
"What's happening?" 

One of them replied, "The passengers are protesting that the train is taking 
so long." 

India: everything is here—from the crudest vulgarisms to the subtlest 
sublimities. This leads me into describing today's episode, the cherry on my 
dharma samiksha cake. 

Tonight was the third night of the new moon. I was busy the first two 
nights and this was the last possible night for doing my kapalika meditation. I 
had no choice but to break my journey here. 

This was my first time in Lucknow and I had no idea where I could find the 
cremation grounds — the place for burning the dead, which is always located 
on a river shore. My questions raised a few eyebrows, but ultimately led me to 
a quiet corner of the city where I met the servant of a rich businessman. His 
master was out of town, so he invited me to rest in his humble quarters. He said 
he would show me the cremation ground at midnight. 

In the meantime, this illiterate man became intrigued by my talk of 
meditation. I initiated him. We meditated together, and had a simple 



271 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


supper. Later, in the dead of the night, he led me toward the river. As we came 
closer and closer, however, his legs seemed to drag. 

"Sir, that's it... there," he said, pointing a shaking finger at the darkness at 
the end of the road. 

"Very good," I said. "But don't call me Sir." 

After walking some steps, I noticed he was lagging behind. "Come along," 
I said. "What's the matter?" 

"Sir ... ah, Dada, don't no go, Sir. Bad ... verry bad ..." 

"Nonsense. There's nothing to be afraid of." I continued walking. I heard 
him start panting. 

I arrived at the gate. He hung back about ten feet, shaking. 

"Pie pie pleazzze. Sir ... no, no!" 

"If you don't want to come in with me. it's no problem. You can go back to 
your house, and I'll go in alone." "Really, Sir?" "Yes, sure. Why not?" 

Saying, "Okay! Okay!", he spun around and took to his heels, sprinting 
back down the road so fast that he reminded me of a character in a Charlie 
Chaplin film. 

I turned back to face the gate. I noticed the total absence of sound. Even the 
leaves were silent. It was, somehow, artificial—too sudden. This may be 
interesting, I thought. 

I passed through the gate and began walking down the grass-covered steps 
in the pitch darkness. I could only feel my way forward. Slowly, slowly... 

A yell came from below! I halted to listen. A man's voice, harsh, 
threatening. I knew enough Hindi to understand his unmistakable warning: 
"Don't dare to enter! Get out of here!" 

An Avidya Tantric, I thought. A lover of the dark force. A personal-power 
seeker. A black magician. 

Yes this will really be interesting, I thought, smiling. 

I stepped down: one step, two, three... 

Again he shouted, with a guttural force I had never encountered before. "I'll 
kill you, you madman! Begone! Begone!" He swore at me, using very dirty 
language. 

My mind was calm. I was a bit surprised how I was taking it. This was to 
be a challenge arranged by Baba's grace. I went on thinking of Him, confident 
that no power could be greater than His. 



Lord Shiva Never Did It 


272 


I walked further, and at last was the bottom of the stairway. 

"I'll murder you!" he screamed so loudly that I was momentarily stunned. 
Then I think he added, "And drink your blood! And eat your flesh! And 
swallow your bones!" 

I had heard that some Avidya Tantrics can consume an entire human body 
in one sitting. It is one of their systems for extracting power from other 
Tantrics. 

To hell with you, I thought clearly. I felt he could hear my thoughts. And 
perhaps it was so. For, as I continued on, he made no further sound. 

His voice had come from the darkest comer of the place. In that direction, 
nothing was visible. In other directions though I could perceive vague shapes, I 
was unable to recognize anything. Then I saw a faint red light. It was the dying 
remains of a fire, a few embers. I walked toward it, feeling my way forward 
with my sandaled feet. 

What was that? A movement near the fire ... what? ... a pair of ... yes ... a 
pair of eyes. I walked nearer. What? Not two eyes, four. No, more.... Many 
many eyes. Fantastic! I went on walking, thinking of Baba with each step. 

Then I made out a form: a dog. No, there were many dogs. Scores of them. 
Maybe thirty or forty. As I drew closer, I could see their eyes gleaming with 
excitement. They were eating the last remains of a dead body. Their teeth 
glistened. They growled menacingly, facing me. I felt I could hear their 
thoughts: Don't come forward anymore! 

To hell with you too, I thought in reply. I continued moving toward them 
now that I could make out a path which passed near the fire. If I moved in any 
other direction God knows what I might have fallen into. 

They growled louder. Though my body moved on, my thoughts stood still, 
contemplating Guru. I passed in front of the dogs. They snarled and bared their 
teeth but let me pass. 

As I walked on further, I heard the bubbling of a river. I walked up to it, 
and put my materials on the sand. This was my spot. After preparing for the 
meditation, I started dancing Shiva's Tandava to increase my courage. 
Immediately the man yelled and the dogs barked. With each step, I leapt high in 
the air, laughing in transcendental pleasure. 

Then I sat. At last, undisturbed by any sound, I easily slipped into deep 
meditation. 



273 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


When I finished, I walked back toward the fire. The dogs were still there. 

But this time something was different. They looked mad. Their mouths 
hung open, saliva dripped from their teeth. They growled loudly—very loudly. 
Perhaps they were angry that I had succeeded in thwarting their efforts to stop 
me. 

Seeing no alternative way, I continued walking toward them. They began 
moving here and there, and... what? They assumed an ominous shape. In the 
front was one dog, then two dogs, then three or four, then more—it looked like 
a triangle or a wedge pointed at me. Suddenly, they charged, growling 
furiously. Though I was still thinking of Baba, He put another idea in my brain: 
I 'll kill the first dog, I thought. 

In the very next moment after that thought, even before my hand could 
reach toward the knife which was in my pocket, the lead dog jumped into the 
air and let out a human-like scream. He somersaulted backward, smashing into 
the other dogs. Some of them screamed, others barked in low voices, as they 
fell apart from each other, confused, hurt, scattered. 

I watched it all, from a point deep inside, not from my normal waking 
consciousness. The dogs looked away from me, whimpering, crying, and lost. 

I walked on, came to the stairs and climbed out of this bizarre world. The 
man and the dogs had fallen into silence. Coming up onto the road, I didn't 
bother to look back. 

Delhi. I mentioned yesterday's episode to an old Dada here. He said, "Yes, 
those dogs were real dogs. But they were controlled by the mental power of the 
Avidya Tantric. It's a common phenomenon. He uses them for many purposes, 
including both protection and attack. When you thought to kill the first dog, the 
man surely caught your thought, and was terrorized. If you had killed that dog, 
who was moving on the thought currents of the man, it would have caused him 
great harm. It might even have killed him. That's why there was such a reac¬ 
tion. Anyway it's Baba's play. He arranges such experiences for those who need 
them. If we surrender to Him. we pass the test. Of course the tests never stop. 
But. then, neither does His grace."

People's movement 

Manerbio, Italy. 1982. The Margis have uncovered a major case of graft 
and corruption, and have organized a movement to try to stop it —Prout in 
action! 74 In a few months the local government plans to close the Manerbio 
hospital and shift its facilities to another town. The only reason for the move is 
the financial benefit it will bring to the host of companies involved in the 
construction of the new hospital. The losers will be the people of Manerbio, 
who will lose their hospital. 

Sister Damayanti is the leader of this fledgling movement, along with her 
husband Jiivananda and two other Margis. Over the last few weeks many 
volunteers have helped them to distribute leaflets and collect petition 
signatures. Today they held their first demonstration. It was a grand success. 
Over 4000 people came and joined in the march. 

Two months later. By now, the "Save Our Hospital" movement has had 
four demonstrations, with up to 8000 participants apiece. A few days ago an 
incident occurred which showed how much the local people have come to trust 
the Margis: During a village meeting held in a market place, speakers 
expressed their opinions about city conditions. At one point, a well-known 
priest said, "We have to encourage more 


74 At this point in time, Prout people's movements outside of India were still a novelty, i.e, such 
work had only just begun. Though M argis were the leaders of these actions, the participants 
were primarily non-M argis. The actions were of two main types—positive constructive 
programs and anti-exploitation drives. For example, I had recently participated in initiating a 
mass-housing action in Holland, and an anti-pornography drive in Norway. In India, Prout 
people's movements had already begun many years before. Some had the support of hundreds 
of thousands of people.

the involvement by the young people of our city. Just see what good work is 
being done by those leading the Save Our H ospitat movement." 

From the crowd one women yelled back, "Si, noi crediamo piu in quei 
giovani che in te/—Yes, we believe more in those young people than in you!" 
Another yelled, “Perche voi preti non avete fatto niente per salvare il nostro 
hospetale tanto tempo fa?— Why didn't you priests do anything to save our 
hospital long ago?" Someone else added, "Te giusto Stai saltando sul populare 
vagone della bandal— You're just jumping on a popular band-wagon!" 

An incident happened today which also demonstrates the movement's 
strength, but in a shocking manner. After a morning meeting in one section of 
the city, the Margis drove to another meeting in a different part of town. 
Damayanti was so inspired she sang Baba Nam Kevalam the entire way, about 
thirty minutes, over the loud-speaker system mounted on the car's rooftop. At 
the foot of a hill leading up to the meeting site, the car's engine died. After the 
Margis got out of the car, a man opened the hood to check on the cause of the 
failure. He discovered a bomb lodged there! Because Damayanti had been 
using the amplifier throughout the whole drive, the weak electrical system was 
sufficiently over-taxed to cause the engine to die, leaving an insufficient charge 
for the bomb to explode. 

Though the lives of the Margis were obviously saved by the grace of Baba, 
this experience shook them up. They had not understood the extent of the 
danger they faced from opponents of their movement. 

Two weeks later. Today the local government announced its decision not 
to shift the hospital. A big party will be held by the public honoring Damayanti 
and the other leaders of the Save our H ospital movement. 

Over the last weeks Damayanti and Jiivananda's meditation became 
irregular. They gave more importance to their social work than to their spiritual 
practices. As a result, their behavior became more aggressive and egoistic. 
Fortunately, through discussion with acharyas a few days ago, they recognized 
this loss of balance — and they re-started their spiritual discipline. 

It is surprising but true that those who work more also need to meditate 


more.

A desperate attack 

Luxembourg. 1 May. There is news from Calcutta. It is so outrageous, so 
abominable, so heinous that I find it difficult to write. 

Yesterday morning at 6:30, our workers were attacked while coming by 
taxis to our Calcutta headquarters. Seventeen Dadas and Didis were killed in an 
atrocious manner. The same vicious tactic was used in each case. The attackers 
stopped the taxis at railroad crossings, pulled our workers out onto the street 
and first beat them with iron rods to make them helpless. They then blinded 
them by throwing acid in their eyes, gouged out their eyes with knives, stabbed 
them repeatedly, and finally doused their bodies with petrol and burned them. 

Over the last few weeks, the Communists prepared the public for this 
attack by holding small street demonstrations and claiming that our orphanages 
and schools are full of children we stole from their parents. In response, we 
approached both politicians and newspapers to show the documentation of all 
the orphans under our care. We challenged the demonstrators to produce even a 
single parent with a complaint against us. Instead of responding to our 
documentation, the Communists tried to drum up further hostility by repeatedly 
shouting over loud-speakers "Beware of the Ananda Margi child-lifters!" 

Only when the attacks occurred did anyone recognize that the dem¬ 
onstrations were part of a strategy to protect the true villains. At yesterday 
morning's press conference. Communist politicians claimed that the violence 
was the spontaneous result of mob psychology, and that the attackers were 
parents and local people. 

From the first, however, the public and the media unanimously rejected this 
explanation. The claim that it was a spontaneous uprising was patently absurd. 
How could a spontaneous uprising happen simultaneously in three separate 
locations, using identical methods? The local police were also responsible. For 
one hour after the attacks they refused to initiate an investigation, even though 
their station was within 200 meters of the incidents. 

The attackers' true intentions become clear once you add the fact that our 
Central workers come to the office by taxi at just this hour every day. Only 
because Baba requested a special meeting the previous night was their schedule 
different yesterday. The mobsters planned 



277 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


to kill the Central workers, but instead the victims were all school teachers 
coming for a teachers' meeting. 75 

It may seem strange, but the Communists fear our moral integrity and low- 
budget social work. In comparison they know that their government looks 
corrupt and ideologically backward. Our legal section has filed cases but the 
attackers have already absconded through police complicity. Since we well 
know that the West Bengal government will never make any investigation, we 
are demanding an inquiry by the federal government. Considering that Ananda 
Margis have never engaged in violence, and that we have been victims of 
numerous personal and property attacks by the Communists, one would think at 
least the federal government will cooperate. But I do not expect cooperation, 
because the federal government is as corrupt as the state body. 

In the face of these assaults, and without hope of government or police 
assistance, should we give up our social work and our social movements, and 
join the under-the-table diplomacy which rules the country? 

Or should we gain strength and inspiration from the understanding that the 
corrupt are bound to attempt to destroy those who are non-compromisingly 
striving toward goodness? The answer is obvious. 

Necessary insight and intuition 

Calcutta. Several court cases are going on, most of them initiated by 
Ananda Marga to protest oppression by local communists or other politicians. 
While informing Baba of the progress of these cases, one worker asked Baba 
for guidance. 

Baba replied: "Ours is a missionary work. You are all working for long and 
have sufficient experience. Must I give suggestions on each and every petty 
matter? It gives me much pain. If you all are simply 


75 Since apparently Baba knew the attack would occur, the question may arise why He allowed 
the school teachers to fall into the trap. Why does Baba (or for that matter God) allow anyone in 
the world to suffer or die? I believe that suffering can often be a positive force in the path of 
spiritual awakening. We are born in order to realize life's lessons. Suffering and death are vital 
for that realization. Why Baba freed some people from certain suffering, and did not free 
others, isa far too complicated matter for me. Thedeep psycho-spiritual needsof both 
individuals and the society are involved. Surely He had His plan, and followed it.

sincere with your meditation and 16 Points, you will get the necessary insight 
and intuition. This applies to all workers." 

He requested this statement to be made known to all workers. 

Just words 

Ananda Nagar. During afternoon reporting, one-by-one we stood in front of 
Baba, undergoing His scrutiny. When it was my turn. He exposed some of the 
defects of my work, and then began beating me with His stick. 

The General Secretary said to me, "Give some explanation." 

Usually workers reply by saying something like, "I will do my work better, 
.Baba," or "I tried my best. Baba, but couldn't get the public's response," or 
"Baba, Baba, Baba!" or some other unimpressive statement. Generally He 
continues the beating for some time. 

But I said spontaneously, "I am lazy and selfish!" 

His whopping became softer. 

"I am stupid and insincere!" 

The beating stopped. "What do you say, my boy?" Baba said. "I will change my 
ways and not waste a single solitary moment!" I said decidedly. 

"Yesss. Very good." 

Afterward, one Dada said to me, "Those replies to Baba were very clever." 
"But I meant it," I said. 

During the night reporting that same Dada came under Baba's stick. 
Immediately he said. "I'm worthless and slothful!" Beat beat beat. 

"I'm egoistic and not industrious!" Beat 
beat beat. 

"Yes, yes. We know that," said Baba. 

Beat beat beat. 

"But I'll become a perfect worker, Baba!" Beat beat 
beat. 

"Just words. Just words," said Baba. Beat 
beat beat. 

The Dada looked at me. I shrugged my shoulders. 



279 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Baba, Baba, Baba!" he said. 

The beating went on about double the normal time for him. 

Penniless in the Arctic 

Nuuk, Greenland. 1983. I was the first worker to visit this Arctic colony, 
the biggest island in the world. Previously I worked in the southern part, but 
this is my first time in Nuuk, the capital city. I have no contacts here and no 
return ticket. Back in Denmark I purchased a round-trip ticket from 
Copenhagen to Sundre Stromford. For a bit of fun I only brought enough 
money for a one-way ticket from there to Nuuk. I'm scheduled to be here for 
ten days. In the meantime Baba, you'll have to create enough Margis to pay for 
my missing plane fare, and my daily expenses. To add some spice to this brew, 
one of the Danes I met today said, "Good luck to you. It's a rare Eskimo who's 
mind is not lost in booze, dancing and motorcycles." 

The winter is harsh here. Half the flights usually get canceled due to bad 
weather. As I walk through the streets, I sometimes have to grab onto a tree to 
stop myself from being blown over. It once took me forty-five minutes to walk 
a distance which should have taken fifteen minutes. Coming back, I needed 
only five minutes — I was almost flying. Even the women wear pants here, so I 
am doubly unique in my orange lungi, which billows in the wind like a full 
skirt. I don't know why I remain warm even while trudging through deep snow. 

Nuuk is called "the big city", though its population is a mere 10,000. In 
total, Greenland has a population of about 50,000, of which 80% are Eskimos 
and 20% are Danes. By World War II the majority of Eskimos had converted 
from nomad-life to town-life, though not out of preference. The shift was 
primarily to assist doctors who were facing difficulties trying to protect the 
people from diseases caused by "civilization". 

Since it is my policy not to stay in hotels while teaching meditation. Baba 
kindly arranged for me to "accidentally" meet a man who invited me to stay in 
his house. (One way or another, no matter where I am. He always provides a 
house for my stay.) I began setting up lectures immediately. 

Next day. While walking in the snowy streets, I was surrounded by a group 
of about twenty teenage boys. They were a rowdy bunch, itch

mg for a fight. When they began pushing one another, it became clear that their 
real intention was to get around to pushing me. They were keen to test this 
strange man with a turban. 

Later I came to know that it's considered comical in Greenland whenever 
anyone falls down in the snow, especially if one gets hurt. 

When they were just about to fling themselves into me, I had an inspiration. 
"I say! Do any of you know a good song to sing?" 

A few of them knew enough English to understand me, and they fell into a 
parley. Seconds later they burst into an Eskimo tune, complete with 
gesticulations. That completed, I requested another song, and they complied 
with increasing enthusiasm. 

Then they demanded a song from me so I regaled them with my latest 
frozen version of Baba Nam Kevalam. I made them sing it together with me, 
and soon we became fast friends. 

By evening, word had gone around about that fine Dada fellow. 

Coldest cold 

Last night I had to perform my kapalika meditation. The only graveyard is 
dead-center in the middle of the town, flooded by electric light, so I opted 
instead for a tiny dark peninsula where long ago the people used to bring sick 
babies who would be left in the cold for some hours. If they survived, they were 
considered strong enough to deserve care. If they died, that proved they were 
better off dead. 

Before beginning meditation I already felt chilled to the bone due to the 
freezing breeze. The wind was so strong that it tore off my lungi, which I had to 
dive to catch. Before I could grab it, the sea almost claimed it, and in the 
process I slipped on the ice just on the edge of the water, a dark mass of 
heaving waves. In the last moment, my foot caught on a jutting piece of ice, 
stopping my fall. I slowly edged my way backward a few feet, and arranged for 
my meditation without benefit of cover or blanket. 

After a minute or two I no longer noticed the intense cold. Indifference to 
temperature is a common experience for those practicing kapalika meditation. 
Thirty minutes later, when I had finished, I again became aware of my body, 
which began shivering so strongly that I could not hold my equipment. Hardly 
able to stand, I dragged myself toward a nearby house especially arranged for 
my stay on this night. 



281 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


After crossing the threshold, I laid thawing out on the floor about ten minutes, 
before moving toward my room. 

The next morning I was fine. No matter what difficulties I face during 
meditation, I never seem to fall sick. 

We had group meditation this evening. Because no one moved even 
slightly, and because there was heavy snow around the house, we experienced 
complete soundlessness. Impressive, especially considering it was their first 
such meeting. 

Nothing unlikely 

During my previous visit to southern Greenland a good number of people 
learned meditation. I didn't think to contact any of them, however, because the 
only way to travel between cities in winter is by plane. 

Yesterday, my first initiate down there had a strong thought of me and 
Baba. On the strength of that feeling alone, she flew here hoping to find me. 

When she saw me today, she was just as surprised as anyone else that her 
intuition had been correct. 

They say for the devotee nothing is impossible, or even unlikely. 

Faith and fortune 

A unit committee was formed tonight, selected from among the forty 
Margis who have learned meditation in the nine days since I've been here. The 
prediction about Eskimos lacking interest in meditation was wrong. About 80% 
of these new Margis are Eskimos, exactly reflecting their proportion in society. 

I spoke to the most inspired sister, "I don't have money for my return fare to 
Sundre Stromford. And I have to leave tomorrow evening." 

"Dada!" she said. "What are you going to do?" 

"No, no," I laughed. "That's my question to you." 

"But I'm just a student..." 

"Can I see your tongue?" 

She stuck it out. 

"It looks like a healthy tongue. Perhaps it will be of some use in asking the 
other Margis for help. But don't press them. They should only give according to 
their feelings." 

She flashed a big smile and immediately left the room.

Next day. That sister ran up to me late this morning, saying. "Dada, look! 
We collected half of your ticket money! Here, please take it." 

"Thanks. Just see how Baba helps." 

"Yes.... Now what are you going to do to get the rest?" 

I laughed and said, "Again, that's my question to you." 

"But... I already asked everyone for money." 

"Well, how about going back to them, and asking for ideas how to get the 
rest?" 

"But the airlines office closes in just four hours." 

"If you do your best, Baba will arrange everything. And remember, no 
pressure!" I said. 

When at last she proudly presented the necessary amount for my ticket, we 
only had time to run to the airline office and slip in the door as it was about to 
be locked. 

Who's depending on whom? 

Oslo. Today was the second and closing day of a skiing weekend that I had 
organized here in the Norwegian Alps as part of my regular sports and 
adventures program. 76 This was only the second time I'd been skiing. The 
first time was earlier this winter when I conducted a one-week outing in the 
Swiss Alps. Norwegians are a people said to be bom with skis on their feet. We 
held racing competitions. To allow me to participate, they gave me a liberal 
handicap of one minute on each run. 

Toward the end of the day. in an effort to see how fast 1 could go, I ordered 
my feet not to turn inward, i.e. I would not allow myself to slow my downhill 
speed. I was soon moving faster than anyone else on the mountain. It was 
exhilarating. The only problem was that I had not yet mastered sharp turning. 
Because I could not turn around each of the skiers I was passing, I had to yell at 
those in front of me, "Look out! Look out!" Once they saw me they jumped out 
of the way. A neat, albeit, self-centered system. 


76 At this time I was working as sectorial secretary of the Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures 
Club, Two or three times a month we conduct weekend outings in different regions of the sector 
These programs ranged from mountain climbing, horseback riding, boating, forest hikes, and 
sports matches on up to full scale training camps teaching relief skills, first-aid, self-defense, 
survival ski I Is and higher philosophy.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


At last I came to the final turn, sure that I had cut at least two minutes from 
my previous best time. As I rounded the comer I had a shock. Directly in front 
of me was a group of about thirty students, surrounding their teacher, who was 
lecturing them on some subtle point which demanded their full attention. When 
I yelled "Look out! Look out!" none of them heard. Within a moment I was on 
them. At the last moment they noticed me and scrambled out of the way. One of 
them, however, was not quite quick enough. My skis latched onto his; my head 
continued forward while he was thrown down; and then my feet, still wearing 
the skis, flipped over my head as I flew through the air over a fence. 

While most of the route is open, fences are erected only where the fall is 
precipatedly steep. Thus, as I merrily winged my way over that fence, thinking 
of Baba, I was blissfully unaware that I was courting sweet death. What trouble 
some of us children make for our Father. He was compelled to save me by 
arranging my head-down-feet-up fall in a tree in such a way that my skis 
caught in the branches; I finished my route hanging upside-down with the top of 
my skull a few centimeters from the ground. 

Throughout the weekend a fourteen year-old lad had taken a special interest 
in me; we usually skied together. This time, however, I had left him far behind 
in my flakes. Now, as he caught up, he saw me dangling from the tree, and 
shouted, "Wow, Dada! How'd you do that?" 

"I'd prefer to tell you a little later," I said. "Now how's about lending me a 
hand, brother?" 

It was nearly as dangerous getting me down as it had been getting there, but 
after a few minutes of nerve-racking efforts, my young friend had me back on 
my feet. Unbeknownst to me, the entire escapade, including my brief flight, had 
happened in plain view of the 200 or so skiers who were waiting for the ski-lift. 
I was met by loud applause while finally skiing down to the bottom. 

The only explanation I can think of why He bothers to save such zany 
people like me time and again, is because normal conservative people are 
unwilling to lead this sort of Tantric lifestyle in which one never knows what 
will happen next. Baba simply has no alternative. 

Entertainment at government expense 

Paris. Last night, while traveling in a train and sleeping alone in a six-seat 
compartment, I was woken in an unprecedented manner. A

284 


strong flash of light hit me directly in the face. Immediately I opened my eyes, 
sat up, and saw a man still holding a camera. Without even donating a few 
francs for the privilege of taking my portrait, and without offering a smile, he 
turned on his heels and high-tailed it out of the compartment. And I, without 
any idea as to what I was after, jumped up, and ran in pursuit. As I James- 
Bonded my way down the corridor, I passed a man walking in the opposite 
direction. Arriving at the link between two cars, I suddenly thought. What a 
dope I am! That was the camera-man, throwing me off his scent by acting 
opposite my expectations. I swung around, and raced back, just in time to see 
him disappear through the door leading to the next car. I rushed forward and 
turned the door handle, but he had locked the door behind him. 

Well, I'm not so easily deterred, I thought, and dashed back to my room, 
opened my bag, and took out the key used for the doors between cars. (Because 
I spend so much time on trains, it is convenient to have this key.) Hurrying 
back to the locked door, I opened it. and entered the next car. 

Though I looked at everyone in that car, I could hardly guess which of the 
apparently sleeping suspects was the real spy. Full of wonder, but not 
downcast, I returned to my cabin. Id given it a good try. but once again those 
fellows had gotten the upper hand. I laughed at what expense and trouble they 
were going to in building up their files on such a carefree, harmless guy. They 
consider me a dangerous radical, not realizing the true nature of the spiritual 
revolution for which I am struggling.

Calcutta. Today, during reporting, Baba divided the Dadas into two 
groups—ERAWS (Education, relief and welfare section) and TRIO (a 
conglomerate of the three other major trades). I took my place with the rest of 
the Trio group. 

Baba instructed each group to condemn the members of the other group for 
insufficient speed in our work. Since criticism is a natural lower tendency, 
everyone passionately threw themselves into the allotted task. 

I stood directly in front of Baba, two feet away from Him. The other Dadas, 
all Indian, yelled accusations back and forth in Hindi and Bengali. Since these 
languages are not my forte, I remained silent, preferring to feast my eyes only 
on Baba. For about ten minutes I did 



285 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


nothing but stare at Him, entering into a higher and higher state of mind 
Meanwhile the room was filled with emotion-laden vocabulary. Baba's 
expressions varied throughout, shifting from frowns to smiles to head-nodding 
to "Here here!" and so on. 

All of a sudden He looked straight at me, then pointed and said, "And you! 
What are you looking at?" 

I laughed loudly, then said, "I'm looking at my favorite person." 

"Eh, what do you say?" 

"I'm looking at You, Baba." 

"No, no, no. You also have to play the game. You are not exempt." 

Immediately, without waiting for any further prodding. I turned away from 
Him, and, looking at the ERAWS workers, I said loudly, "You are all just like 
a bunch of dirty ants, not using a drop of your potentiality; you only swim in 
the muds of staticity, becoming more and more grimy with each passing day, 
enjoying your useless existence, and speaking highly of how you moved a few 
twigs and leaves here and there; and then jumping on the nearest sugar cubes 
and licking and licking until you become sick and have to fast ('well it's fasting 
day, and we had to fast anyway,' you say), and proud that you move from place 
to place, diligently making a mess everywhere you go!" 

While I was speaking, everyone was laughing, and Baba said, "Just see ... 
Just see ..." 

"In short," I said, "the pigs who roll in filth are better than you, because in 
the end at least they provide a bit of protein to the meat-eaters." 

I swung back around to Baba. He stuck out His chin and pursed His lips, 
saying, "Yesss. Rightly said." He waved His hand at the others, and again they 
started up. I was left to return to my silence, and dived even more deeply into 
my contemplation of Anandamurtiji. 

This reminds me of a story of a brother who visited Baba in the jail some 
years ago. 

He was an Indian named Rajesh, who was by nature mild and quiet. After 
Rajesh was with Baba in His cell for five minutes, the guard said. "Time's up. 
You'll have to leave now." 

"Rajesh," Baba whispered, "the rule permits you ten minutes. Tell them 
strongly not to disturb us." 

Looking at the guards, Rajesh said softly, "Please don't disturb us."

The guards laughed. Then one of them said roughly, "Now get up and get 
out, young man." 

"Rajesh, you have to shout at them," Baba said. 

"Please don't disturb us!" Rajesh said in a louder voice. 

The guards didn't look pleased. The leader said stiffly, "You have to follow 
what I say. Now leave!" 

"I told you to shout," Baba said. "You've got to do it much louder." 

"You have no right to stop me now!" Rajesh yelled. "You are violating the 
rules, and you are infringing on morality!" Later he said that in all his life, he 
had never raised his voice so loud. 

"You cannot criticize us!" said the guard. "Get out now, or we will take 
physical action against you." 

"Rajesh, you'll have to use all your force and all your anger," said Baba. 

Rajesh stood tall, pointed his finger at the guards, and with burning eyes, 
and a blasting voice shouted, "Get away, you animals!! Or else you'll have to 
suffer forever!!" 

Without another word, the guards all lowered their heads, turned and 
slipped away, tripping over each other, leaving Rajesh and Baba alone. 

"Well done, my boy, well done," Baba said. 

Intervention 

Toronto, Canada. I've been assisting another worker here who is struggling 
to receive political asylum. I had some doubt if our approach was correct or 
not, so I called Calcutta two weeks ago. I asked Dada Rama-nanda to explain 
our strategy to Baba and to let me know His response. 

When I called back a week ago, Ramanandaji said. "I'm sorry. Baba has 
been too busy, and there was no scope to ask. Call me again in a few days." 

Three days ago I again called Ramanandaji and he said, "There's still been 
no chance. Please call later." His tone told me that he didn't want to speak to 
Baba about it. I was desperate, and thought, "Baba, please help..." 

Today I called Dada Ramananda, and he said, excitedly, "A funny thing. 
Honestly, I was hesitating to ask Baba. But just after your last call. Baba came 
out of His room and asked. Who was that on the phone just now?' In all these 
years. He has never once inquired about phone calls. I told Him your name, and 
before I could begin to explain your question. Baba said, 'Yes, I know what 
they are trying to do there. It is good. Tell them to continue their efforts.'"

It's certainly impressive that Baba knew what we were doing without 
having any objective information, but I give more importance to the fact that if 
He had not personally intervened we would never have received a reply. 

Bathroom power 

Oulu, Finland. I am staying in the home of a man to whom I taught 
meditation only yesterday. This morning, after he took his shower, he 
approached me and said, "Dada, I felt an extraordinary vibration in the 
bathroom just now. Did you cause it? Did you practice any special bathroom- 
meditation?" 

"Did you hear anything while I was in the bathroom?" I asked. 

"No. Should I have heard something?" 

"I mean did you hear any sound coming from the bathroom then?" 

"No. I was in my bedroom while you were bathing. It's too far away from 
the bathroom for me to hear anything." 

"Then I'm surprised. Yes, 1 always chant a special mantra when I finish my 
shower. But I never expected someone else might notice the after-effects on the 
bathroom itself." 

"It must be a powerful mantra! What is it? Please teach me!" 

Though I usually only teach this mantra to people who've been meditating 
for a good while, here was a man who was thirsty for experience, even in the 
bathroom. So I explained, "Whenever we take a shower, it's like a fresh start. 
Incantation of the bath mantra inaugurates our coming day, immerses it in God. 
1 love the feeling. While still wet, we face the sun or any other source of light 
and chant this mantra together with some special hand gestures ." Then I taught 
him the bath mantra. 77 

77 The bath mantra itself goes like this: Pitri purushe byo 
ndma/ia, rishi devebyo namaha 

I pay my respect to the ancestors, I pay my respect to the pioneers and wise people B rahmarpandm, 
Brahma havi 

The offering is Brahma (Infinite Consciousness), the object offered is B rahma Brahmagnao 
Brahmanahutam 

The One to whom the offering is made is Brahma, the person who is offering is B rahma 

Brahmaeva tena gantavyam 

The goal of the offering is Brahma 

Brahma karma samadhina. 

When the work of Brahma is done, s amadhi (self-realization) will result.

Calcutta. 1984. Whenever Baba walks downstairs for field walk. He always 
passes by a door behind which I often stand. I keep that door open a crack so 
that I can see Him. He usually stands there for some time, talking with two or 
three workers. I feel He does it just to please those of us looking through the 
crack. 

Today, however, He passed the crack without stopping. I saw Him for only 
a few seconds. Immediately after He left my field of vision, I closed my eyes 
and sat for meditation. A surge of energy rose in my body, halting only at the 
crown of my head, where it continued pulsating throughout a half hour of 
meditation. When I opened my eyes, the powerful vibration ceased. 

One week later. Over these last days I have been grabbing any opportunity 
to see Baba, even for a brief moment. Immediately after seeing Him, I do 
meditation. The throbbing experience invariably returns. This is my own 
personal proof that Baba's body is not like those of other people. Merely seeing 
His body induces a spiritual change in me. Now I understand the true value of 
both physically seeing Gum, and mentally imagining Gum. 

Yes, I understand. But how useful is it to explain this to others? 


When I mentioned my realization to Dada Amalvikashananda, he 
remembered an experience which he had in front of the same door. A very 
different sort of experience.

"A few weeks ago," he said, "Baba smashed my ego just beyond this door. 
I was standing there and talking with Him. He shouted at me about my poor 
work. I was so embarrassed, thinking that everyone was hearing. So very softly, 
I said to Him, Baba, excuse me, but maybe it's better you rebuke me inside the 
house; the neighbors are listening, and they may get the wrong idea.' 

"Baba raised His eyebrows and said sharply in English, 'Prestige, huh? 
Prestige...' 

"He let His words sink into my brain. Then without going inside. He went 
on shouting at me, with only one difference-His voice tripled in volume." 

New cultures: adapt or clash out 

Tokyo, Japan. After eight years working in Europe, I've been posted to the 
Far East Asia sector as the Public Relations Secretary, with additional duties as 
Medical Secretary and Publications Secretary. 78 Though our head office is in 
Tokyo, our greatest number of Margis are in Taiwan. 

This posting is interesting for me from a cultural perspective. It may also 
have a radical psychological effect on me because Oriental human relations are 
completely different from what I'm used to. Until now I could get away with 
being individualistic, forcefully determined, even blunt and ambitious. Not so 
here. These qualities are generally unacceptable among Japanese, Chinese and 
Koreans. 

[Author's note: Such changes in myself did not come as easily as I hoped. 
Though it did not take long for me to properly alter my external behavior, the 
more important development was a mental one. Orientals rarely directly say 
what they intend to communicate; most of them are more sensitive on the 
feeling level. So the mental change I had to undergo to live and work with them 
related to becoming more silent and attuning my intuition. It was such a deep 
process that, even now years later, I don't feel I have completed it.] 


8 The Far East Asia sector consists of J apan, Taiwan, South K orea, Hong K ong, M acao, 

M ainland China, Tibet, M ongolia, North K orea, Asiatic Russia, and thefiveAsian countries of 
theprevious Soviet Union. Because the last ten countries occupy 90% of the geographical area 
of the sector, yet were, at this time, under oppressive communist regimes, we were only able to 
work openly in ten percent of the sector.

Three months later. Public Home Concert program held for the public in 
the yoga center this evening. The program included mime, Indian sitar music, 
and modem dance. 79 

Bad stimulates good 

Train from Delhi to Calcutta. A song inspired by yesterday's train journey 
in an over-crowded second-class wagon: 

Riding on an Indian train, people sleeping brain to 
brain. Heads and feet in touch all the night, their 
minds adjusting more or less right. 

It's terrible to see men packed like sardines, sharing 
their chapatiis and beans. It's terrible to see men 
resting in filth, only to enrich those with the wealth. 

Refrain: 

Lovers of life reject the status-quo. Those who 
accept don't want to grow. Just now there's no 
room to doubt: we've to open to the flow of 
Prout. 

Those stinky lousy capitalists— in their faces they 
deserve flying fists to save them from the path of 
min, or else mankind will be destroyed soon. 

But don't you worry, Jimmy or Joe, 
there's purpose in this painful show. 


79 This was the first of our Home Concert series, which continued on a monthly basis for seven 
years. Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA) became well known to much of 
Tokyo's progressive community because of these special programs. I say special because in all of 
J apan, R A WA's concerts were the only informal affairs at which there was no smoking or 
drinking, at which the performers knew they would be watched with full attention, and after 
which fine vegetarian meals were served during which peoplehad an opportunity to socialize.

Realization comes out of clash. So pity the 
man with excessive cash. 

Refrain 

Bad is made to stimulate good, without which wed not

To answer to the eternal call we've to polarize almost ail- 
so mediocrity becomes far less, and purpose comes from 
our unending stress.

Do you like It, my boy? 

Ananda Nagar. 1985. Dada Yatishvarananda told me a story from his days 
as a regional secretary in India. Baba was making a tour of south India, and 
Dada was accompanying Him. Many local Margis came to meet Baba at an 
airport where His flight was in transit. In an informal mood. Baba asked one 
mother to pass her young son to Him. Baba took the boy in His lap. Dada was 
standing behind Baba, and was very curious because he had never seen Baba 
treat a child in this way. Baba smiled, then gently grasped the boy's lips, and 
sweetly said, "Yes, yes, my boy." The child became excited and shouted, 
"Baba! Baba!" Immediately the mother and most of the other Margis began 
softly crying. Dada said that he thoroughly enjoyed the scene, though he had no 
idea what caused their tears. 

Shortly after, Baba and Dada were called for their flight. Baba's security 
guard delayed slightly and then met them inside the plane. When he sat down, 
he said to Dada, "Do you know what really happened back there?"

Dada said, "No. Tell me." 

The guard said, "Afterward, I asked the mother and other Margis, who 
were all completely thrilled. They told me that even though that boy was four 
years old, he had never uttered a single sound. They believed he was 
completely mute. Though it seemed Baba made no special effort, He made the 
child speak." 

At this moment Baba turned His face toward Dada, and said, "Do you like 
it, my boy?" 

Fighting samskara 

Tokyo. Virendra from America is here. He is one of only ten non-Koreans 
in the world who have the top black belt of a Korean martial art called K ok Sul 
1/1 /on, the traditional self-defense method used by guards of the Korean royal 
family. Before becoming a Margi, Virendra had a job as a bouncer in a 
California bar. He had to deal daily with tough rowdy drunks. 

When I worked for Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures Club in Europe I 
often arranged self-defense training at our weekend camps. Over the years I 
experimented with different martial art systems. I searched for an instructor 
who could teach enough in a few days to be of practical use for our students, 
but I was unsuccessful in that search. 

I put the problem to Virendra, and he worked out a series of movements 
covering the most common situations which arise during confrontations on the 
streets of our violent world. Of course I asked him to teach me the course. This 
is the first time I've been able to really learn self-defense. 

One month later. I have been practicing Virendra's defense techniques. As 
a consequence, I've been itching for a situation to test my new skill. But I 
thought it unlikely; I've had no need to physically fight anyone for many years. 
Today, while passing through Shibuya, I ran into a Margi who sells paintings 
on the street. He had to go somewhere so he asked me to watch the paintings. 

Soon after he left, another street-seller appeared. He was a French fellow, 
and a head taller than me. 

"Get your stuff out of heere," he said. "This is my place." 

"They're not mine," I said. "I'm just guarding them for a friend. He'll be 
back soon." 



293 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"I don giive a damn! Move iit, or I'll destroy all these paintings." My heart start 
beating faster. Would I get a chance to use my new Skill? 

"I'm not moving, brother," I said, staring him in the face. "And you're also not 
going to touch the paintings." "You wanna fight, huh?" 

"No, I don't want to fight," I fibbed. "But if you'd like to fight. I'm ready." 

He rolled up his sleeves, flexing his muscles. I stood motionless, and 
centered myself as Virendra had taught me. Suddenly he rushed at me. He 
lifted his hands to grab my shirt-front and throw me on the ground. But as he 
did so, I raised my arms in between his, caught his wrists, stepped to the side, 
and pulled him forward in the same direction as his momentum. He fell in a 
heap on the ground, skinning his hands and knees. Fantastic! It was so easy! 

He jumped up, clearly shocked that such a small guy could trip him like 
that. 

"So! You reeally wanna fight, don't you?" he shouted. 

A crowd began to gather around. 

"I told you," I said evenly. "I'm not interested in fighting. It's up to you." 

His eyes shifted nervously as he said, "Are these paintings really not 
yours?" 

"Of course not. My friend will come back soon." 

"Okay," he said softly. "Let us wait for him." 

The crowd dispersed. I offered him a seat. 

The Margi took a long time to come back, so the Frenchman and I got to 
know each other. He had many personal problems, and ended up by asking me 
to teach him meditation. 

I admit I shouldn't have desired this sort of confrontation. But sometimes 
the wild child inside me gets the upper hand. I was lucky this time that Baba 
didn't punish me for my foolishness. 80 

80 The physical world directly reflects the needs of one's mind. A seasoned spiritual aspirant 
usually remains busy in dealing with responsesto very old needs. When such a person createsa 
fresh strong desire for anything, that desire is bound to get fulfilled. Usually it happens sooner 
rather than later. Conscious desire is dangerous, however, because it is contrary to the path of 
selflessness.

Non-stoppable devotees 

Calcutta. Among the different gifts I brought for Baba this time was a 
bottle of chocolate Horlicks powdered-malt mix. 81 Today I was happy to see 
Dada Keshavananda prepare a big glass of the Horlicks for Him. 

A few minutes later, Dada came out of Baba's room. He put the half-empty 
glass on a table. "Did Baba enjoy it?" I asked. "Of course." 

"Did you mention my name?" "Of 
course." 

"Thank you. Now, how about a little prasad (spiritually vibrated food)?" 

* 

"What?" he said. "Don't be silly. You know wholetimers can't take 
chocolate." 

"C'mon, Dada. It's prasad. No problem." "Noway." 

Starting to advance toward the glass, I said, "Please, Dadaji." "No. You're 
not permitted." 

"Well, I'm just going to take it," I said, moving closer to the glass. "No. 
Don't touch it." "I'm taking it." 

"No! It will... what are you doing?" "Drinking 
it of course!" "You drank it!" "Of course." 

Even in the case of Dadas, boys will be boys. 

[Author's note: This reminds me of an incident that occurred when Baba 
was in Germany. At 10:00 a.m. on a fasting day. Dada Karuna 


81 Dadas and Didis are not permitted to eat mildly stimulating food I ike chocolate, non-herbal 
tea, coffee and Coca Cola, Baba, however, did not follow such a restriction because He wished 
to provide a living example not only for renunciatesbut also for family people (who are 
permitted to eat such thingsin moderation). For the same reason. Healso shaved. However, He 
fasted four times a month like a renunciate, and of course completely refrained from 
consuming such foods as meat, fish, eggs, onion, garlic, mushroom, alcohol and narcotics.

nanda and I were waiting for Baba in His house. We were alone when we 
noticed four glasses, each with a small amount of orange juice. Obviously this 
was the remains of a pre-dawn drink Baba had taken in preparation for fasting. 
We grinned at each other, and, without exchanging a word, each picked up a 
glass and bottomed-up. Then, laughing with glee, we proceeded to the third and 
fourth glasses—merrily breaking our fasts. Actually, I didn't really feel as if I 
had broken my fast, since the orange juice was pure prasad— not food. I didn't 
feel the slightest twinge of conscience. To the contrary, even now looking back 
so many years, I still derive a certain pleasure from the simple devotion that 
guided us. ] 

Real life drama 

During our global reporting sessions, Baba has a fixed order in which He 
calls the representatives from the different sectors of the world. At present I am 
representing Hong Kong sector, which is always the first sector to be called. (In 
Ananda Marga, the Far East Asia sector is called 'Hong Kong sector'.) 

The session began: 

BABA: How many district in-charges came from the ladies' section of 
Hong Kong Sector? 

GLOBAL HEAD OF WOMEN’S WELFARE DEPARTMENT: Ah... ah... 

BABA: Speak up. 

GLOBAL HEAD WOMEN’S DEPARTMENT: Ah... none. Baba... 

BABA: Haat! What nonsense? Let the lady representative of Hong Kong 
Sector step forward. (Silence. No one moves.) What is this? Is there no 
representative even? 

GLOBAL HEAD WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT: I ... I'm sorry. Baba. She 
did not arrive yet. (In fact, all the Didis of all sectors except Hong Kong are 
present. There is no question of "yet".) 

BABA: What a sorry scene. Stupid, nonsense. Then let the male 
representative of Hong Kong Sector step forward. (I move to the front.) What is 
the excuse? (I remain mum.) How can you justify such nefarious behavior? 
(Though; I am silent, and nothing could be more awkward, nevertheless I'm 
enjoying His attention. Any attention is better than none.) And how many 
district in-charges are present from the male side of Hong Kong Sector? 



296 


Forgetting and Remembering 

ME (unhesitating, with a clear voice, head unbent): Zero, Baba. (An abrupt 
silence rolls over the room. Everyone holds their breath, expecting an onslaught 
from Baba. Sure enough...) 

BABA (shouting at such a volume it can be heard well beyond the closed 
door): What?! You foolish idiot! Scoundrel rascal! Then what was your purpose 
in coming here?! Have you come just to enjoy yourself?! Just to kill our time?! 
You have no right to be here! (Pointing His finger toward the door, He shouts at 
ear-splitting volume:) Get out!! Get out!! Get out just now!!! 

ME (speaking quickly): But, Baba, district in-charges are on their way from 
Taiwan—they will surely be here any moment. (Though this is a possibility, it 
sounds like a common, lame excuse. Everyone in the room remains super tense.) 

BABA (turning His head from side to side, squinting His eyes, pushing His 
lower lip out, and speaking in a radically opposite voice, that is, softly and 
slowly): But... don't they know? ... Don't they know that they are to arrive here 
by the 30th?... GS Dada? (Confusion reigns in the room due to Baba's sudden 
mood change.) 

GENERAL SECRETARY: Yes, Baba, they must know. (Silence as Baba 
turns His head again and again.) 

BABA (in a low, almost inaudible voice): Alright... and ... Manila Sector ... 
what is your status? 

After receiving Baba's spiritual force, my mind was so blown that I could not 
think what to do next. Several Central workers motioned me to fall back into 
line. The session continued on a low key. 

A few minutes later. Baba signaled the end of reporting. After the Didis and 
sisters left the room, we performed M adhur Sadhana in front of Baba. 82 Then He 
left the room. Immediately, four or five Central workers came to me and asked, 
"What happened? Just when we were sure you would be out on your ear, and all 
of us would have to step forward to give explanation for your indiscipline; just 
when we thought there would be a thick drama complete with punishment; just 
then. Baba changed His mood and let you go. He saved you. Dharmaveda- 
nanda." 

82 Madhur Sadhana is a special spiritual practice which includes kiirtan. It is done only by 
acharyas. Didisand Dadasperform it separately.

"I don't have any idea," I said. "My district in-charges really are coming, 
you know." 

"Sure, sure!" they all laughed, not believing me. 

Two overseas workers then walked up to me. Expressing surprise, they 
said, "Hey, what? You're still here? But Baba told you to get out, didn't He?" 

Now I laughed. The tension and impact created by Baba's shouting had 
been so much that these two workers had not even perceived the exchange 
afterward between Baba and me about the Taiwan district in-charges. These 
two must have been in shock. 

I was about to leave the room when Baba's personal assistant, 
Keshavanandaji, re-entered. "Dharmavedananda, Baba just asked me to collect 
any further information on the Taiwan district in-charges." 

"I don't know," I said uneasily. "They were... supposed to come by now." 

"Baba mentioned that they may now be somewhere between Nepal and 
India." 

"It could be," I said. "I don't know." "And He 

wants an investigation made." 

I laughed nervously. What was this all coming to? Was He planning to 
catch me on another day about my so-called missing Margis? I sighed, thinking, 
H e will do whatever H e likes. A rid whatH e likes is perfect. 

Three days later. Twice daily Baba has been asking for any report on the 
Taiwan Margis. At last today information arrived from northern Bihar near the 
Nepali border. The four Taiwan Margis really are there—but they are in jail! 
Getting Indian visas in Taiwan is an extremely long process, and to avoid being 
late, they came without visas, trying to cross the border without being seen. 

Surely Baba saw their situation in that same moment when He suddenly 
changed His mood in reporting. 

Three months later. Tokyo. 1986. Today I spoke by phone with Taipei. The 
four brothers and sisters who were arrested in India arrived back home a few 
days ago. After their ordeal, they received a 



Forgetting and Remembering 


298 


hero's welcome. They spent three months being shifted from prison to prison in 
northern Bihar. For part of that time they were held in the Bankipur Jail in 
Patna where Baba had stayed. For one month they fasted on only water and 
juice to protest their imprisonment. During that time, they had special 
experiences of Baba's grace—brother Keshava even had a few visions of Baba 
in his cell. Toward the end they all had the clear intuitive foreknowledge of the 
exact date that they would be released. Though they were unable to enter India, 
their risks and sacrifices led to some colorful moments. Dare I say the spiritual 
benefit was even greater than if they had passed undisturbed into India and 
physically met Baba? 

Dream trance 

Benefit concert held on behalf of our work in Burkina Faso, Africa. 550 
people attended. By the collection from this program a medical center will be 
built. 83 

I had a dream early this morning: 

After walking through a pasture alone with Baba, we stood outside His 
house. He told me, "It will be highly useful for you to engage in three 
activities. The first is writing. Your writing will enable you to contact many 
leading personalities. And that is your second work: to meet such leaders. For 
example, university presidents,...." His voice trailed off, so I could not catch 
the other examples. 

At that moment a few workers and Margis joined us. 

"I know some leading musicians who might perform for our benefit 
concerts," I said. 

"That's nice," Baba said. 

Brother Naviin, a Margi musician said. "I would love to hear those 
performers. Baba, a few years ago we arranged a large concert in the United 
States, but...." 


83 

At this time the work in Burkina Faso was only just beginning. It took several years to gain 
the trust of the poorest tribal people of this poorest African country. At the time of publication 
the project was established in twelve villages, providing training for the local people to construct 
wells, build irrigation systems, establish grain storehouses, and provide basic medical services.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


"Yes, I know," Baba said, smiling. "I was there with you. and it rained. 
Better to make such programs indoors." 

Before He could mention the third activity, we all went inside His house, 
and then into His office. He sat behind His desk and said to me, "Well, come 
here now. My son should get something." 

I walked up to Him. and He gave me a tap on the top of my head with His 
knuckles. I thought. Now let's see what I feel. But there seemed to be no special 
sensation. 

He directed me to sit down, and then said, "No need of any more words." 
He placed an egg-shaped bag over my head. I understood He was deepening 
my spiritual awareness. Gradually the breathable air decreased, but I didn't 
mind because I knew Baba was in full control. Thinking this. I entered a trance 
in which all thought was suspended. 

I awoke in that condition. 

Serenading God 

Calcutta. I and about twenty other Margis were singing Prabhat Sangiit to 
Baba. 84 He interrupted everyone to speak to me. Pointing to His throat, he 
said, "While singing, you should keep your mind concentrated here." I was 
surprised because when I was a child our singing teacher instructed us to 
project from the chest. Perhaps it is because Baba is more interested in the 
beauty of the sound than the volume of the voice. Or perhaps He meant that 
psychic concentration is on the throat chakra, but physical projection should be 
from the chest and lungs. 

A few days earlier He said, "Those who regularly sing kiirtan gradually 
develop a sweet and melodious voice." Is the reason simply practice, or is it (as 
I believe) because the kiirtan singer is not trying to impress anyone—only to 
serenade God? 

Luminous beings 

Tokyo. Six of us were sleeping (on the floor as always) last night in the 
large room of the yoga center. About 3:00 in the morning I sat up, saying, 
"Where'd they go? Where'd they go?" 

My voice woke Dada Ravindranath. "Where did who go?" he asked. 


84 PrabhatSangiitwere His " Songs of the New Dawn". He usually composed a few daily. 
Eventually Baba composed 5018 songs, all within a space of only eight years. 



Forgetting and Remembering

Suddenly becoming aware of him and the other Margis, I said, "You don't 
know but there are other beings in this house who are even more absorbed in 
music than you." (Ravindranathji usually plays Prabhat Sangiit several hours a 
day on his electric keyboard.) 

"What do you mean?" he said, his curiosity peaked. 

In that moment a thought strongly entered my mind: I must not speak more 
or I will forget everything I saw. So, I said, "Oh, it's nothing." 

Dada Nityashubhananda's voice floated over from the other side of the dark 
room, "It's not nothing." 

Unwilling to be deterred from my silence, I laid down and slept. 

In the morning, after rising. Ravindranathji said, "Dharmaveda-nanda, what 
did you experience last night?" 

"What do you mean?" I said. "I slept all night." 

"No, no, don't you remember?" 

In that moment the memory returned—and with it, a bolt of inspiration. 
Funny, I would have indeed forgotten it all if he hadn't questioned me. 

"As I lay sleeping," I said, "I felt an indescribable vibration which woke me 
up. I looked around, and saw scores, maybe even more than a hundred little 
people. They were pressed against each other, and against these two walls 
(which join in the comer where I slept). Those persons were far from ordinary. 
They were of many colors, sizes and facial expressions. But all had large heads 
with small bodies. Especially minuscule were their arms and legs. I am sure 
they were luminous beings. 

"I looked at them, and they looked at me for several long minutes. I was 
super-awake. The ones here were all siddhas or gandharvas (see following 
footnote). For that reason I said there were some who were more absorbed in 
music than Ravindranathji." 

Nityashubhanandaji then added, "Just before you spoke last night, a wave 
of energy rolled into me also, waking me up. That's why I sat up to do 
meditation. And that's why I knew what you saw was not nothing." 85 


5 Occasionally Baba would give demonstrations exposing the presence of such beings. At those 
times He enabled one or more Dadas to perceive these subtler beings. This was the first time I 
had seen them so clearly and in such number, though I had experi- [continues next page)

Forgetting and remembering 

1987.1 had a dream last night: 

It was set in the future; Baba was an old man. I was together with hundreds 
of devotees who I didn't recognize. We were high in the mountains, seated 
around a small bowl-shaped valley. In front sat the two foremost leaders of 
Ananda Marga—a man and a woman. I knew neither. Baba sat behind us all, 
simply looking on without participating. Everyone's attention was absorbed in 
listening to the two leaders, whose words I cannot remember. 

I too stared at those leaders, until a thought entered my mind: / Ve forgotten 
Baba. 

Turning around, I saw that Baba had already left His seat. 

What is this1 Oh, where is He? I thought. 

Then I saw Him, off in the distance, together with two or three Margis. He 
was climbing the highest mountain peak. 

What a fool I am! Now I've lost this chance to be with Him. 

I saw Him pause by an outhouse. It appeared to be occupied, and He 
waited. As I jumped up to run after Him, I thought, I wonder what is the 
protocol here. Will anyone try to stop me? 

No one noticed me, and I was free. But after running a few steps, I 
remembered that I hadn't put on my sandals. So I ran back to look for them 
among the hundreds of other sandals. 


enced them countless times before in other ways. The yogis explain that a luminous being is an 
entity which has an elevated consciousness like a human but is different because its body is made 
up only of light, gas and ether. It contains no solid or liquid constituents.) ust as every being is 
born to fulfill its own needs along its own evolutionary path, so it is with the luminous being. In 
its previous life, a luminous being was a human who concentrated on a single desire such as the 
propensity to accumulate wealth (yaksa), or to develop artistically (gardharva), or to gain 
psychic experiences through meditation (siddha). To satisfy that desire, its primary activity as a 
luminous being is to intensify the environmental vibration in the field of spirituality or culture or 
beauty or economics or whatever—according to its special need. Its range of activities is limited 
compared with humans. Itissaid that spiritually conducive place and many other places of 
intense activity attract luminous beings who enjoy or maintain or increase the energy. 

People who frequently practice kiirtan may distinctly hear other voices singing kiirtan. It is so 
clear that we often feel compelled to open our eyes, turn around and see if someone else has 
joined the kiirtan—only to discover that no one else is there. But they are there—our physical 
eyes are simply unable to see them. The reader will remember an earlier entry about this.

If I don't find them soon, I'll go without shoes, or take someone else's. 

In that moment, I looked down, and saw my sandals on my feet. How 
strange. What was this except Baba's play? 

I ran to the top of the peak but Baba was gone. Thinking that He must have 
walked down the other side of the mountain, I dashed down the slope with my 
heart in my throat. On the way I encountered one of the mountain-folk 
devotees, a big fellow. He grabbed my arm, and ran at double my speed. As I 
struggled down the path with him, I wondered how I could keep up. Then a 
second giant devotee appeared and took me by my other arm. I laughed at this 
further play of Baba's, as I half-skipped, half-flew downward. They joined my 
laughter. 

Then I saw Baba far below, just as He turned a corner and moved out of 
view. The three of us went even faster, the branches whipping in my face so 
that I had to cover my eyes with my shoulder. I knew it was not only His play, 
but also a test that I must pass before I meet Him. Again and again He appeared 
momentarily, then disappeared around another comer. 

At last I saw Him standing in a fresh green field, surrounded by a score of 
devotees. The two giants released me, and I ran forward, thinking to embrace 
Baba. Something made me stop, however, as I came to the circle of devotees. I 
joined the circle around Him with the others. He wore a heavenly smile, and 
looked at us in a way that drove me mad. 

We are each HisRadha, playing Krishna Liila, I thought. 86 

As we danced, a young boy stepped out of Baba's body, holding a glass of 
juice. He tossed drops of that juice toward us, which we caught in our mouths. 
Then the boy materialized some small milk sweets, which he also threw to us. It 
was prasad, and I tried my best to catch it in my mouth. 

0 h, again I Ve forgotten B aba, I thought, and turned to look at Him. But before 
my face could turn enough to see Him, I woke up. Forgetting ... remembering... 
forgetting... remembering... Is it His one and only Game? 


86 A mythical scene of K rishna's childhood had Him in just this predicament, surrounded by 
many dancing girls, including Radha, His favorite. The myth represents the idea that the entire 
Cosmos is the play of God, and that every entity is knowingly or unknowingly revolving around 
the Cosmic Nucleus. Those who are aware of this gravitate quickly towards H im through the 
force of mutual love.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Yesterday evening I criticized a worker, even though other workers were 
also present. Afterward I regretted my behavior. While falling asleep, I pleaded 
to Baba to free me from this sort of nasty psychological tendency. 

Toward morning, I had a dream: 

A Margi sister committed an error. In front of others, I chided her 
repeatedly for her mistake. Eventually I lifted a stick, and, while still 
reproaching her, softly beat her on the head. She was thoroughly embarrassed. 

From behind a curtain I heard Baba's voice calling to her to come 
immediately. She left me and walked over to Baba. I felt very bad about what I 
had done. 

After a few minutes she returned. I asked her, "What did Baba say to you?" 

"He was angry with me," she said, "because I silently tolerated your public 
criticism of me." 

Before I could ask her anything more, Baba again called her out of the 
room. And I woke up. 

Now is what matters 

I had a long dream about Baba, but the beginning of it remains clearest: 

I was in a room with other workers. Baba appeared at the door and entered. 
I wanted to prostrate before Him. but as no one else did so, I refrained. A few 
moments passed as He walked through the room. 

I am late in offering sastaung pranam (prostration), I thought. M aybe it's no 
longer proper to do.... But devotion knows no time. Then and there I performed 
prostration. 

Baba gave me a beautiful smile, which made me think— The delay had no 
importance for H im. Rather it was spiritually perfect. 

After undue hesitation, why should we hesitate even more? 

Spirituality for all 

Regular classes started for thirty mentally handicapped women. 87 They 
suffer from Downs syndrome and autism. We are teaching them 


87 

As it turned out, almost all of them became positively enthusiastic. In general, mentally 
disadvantaged people love guided gentle movement which does not require too 
much coordination. At the same time, the hormonal balance of their glands improves, making 
them physically and mentally calmer. Some of them even enjoy the deep silence of meditation. 
Permanent results of course take time to achieve.

yoga postures, kiirtan. and a little meditation. Though some people have 
expressed doubt that such people could respond to yoga, many of the women 
were clearly interested during the class. 

Four months later. As it turned out, almost all of them became positively 
enthusiastic. In general, mentally disadvantaged people love guided gentle 
movement which does not require too much coordination. At the same time, the 
hormonal balance of their glands improves, making them physically and 
mentally calmer. Some of them even enjoy the deep silence of meditation. 
Permanent results of course take time to achieve. 

Good inspires, bad strengthens 

Calcutta. I was standing in the middle of the main downstairs room of 
Baba's house in Lake Gardens, surrounded by scores of workers and Margis, 
when one of my higher authorities. Dada M, walked in. Baba had been angry 
with him for not arranging a series of lectures for the Margis. Since Dada 
considered this my duty, now he was angry with me. This was a surprise for me. 
He shouted at me in such a voice that all the others in the room stopped their 
conversations, and turned to look at me. I saw no value in arguing, so without 
reacting or becoming nervous, I simply replied again and again, "Yes, Dada... 
Yes, Dada 

After a minute or two, he ran out of steam, and left in a huff. 

Immediately two Central workers approached me, and one said, 
"Dharmavedananda, I didn't know that you were such a seasoned worker." 

"What do you mean, Dada?" I said. 

"M yelled at you in such a way that it would have embarrassed even an 
elephant. But you took it as cool as a cucumber." 

I smiled. "Well. The credit doesn't go to me. It belongs to another higher 
authority I had for one and a half years. He constantly berated me and hounded 
me to the point that my nervous system can now stand just about anything." 



305

We laughed together, and I added. "It's the beauty of Tantra, you know, 
that we can benefit from every situation. The good moments inspire us, and the 
so-called bad moments strengthen us." 

Soup kitchen started for homeless people in the Shinjuku area. Today we 
served 50 people, almost all of them men. During the program we were 
approached by two Christians who told us they had the responsibility to check 
if any of these people require medical attention. They requested us to inform 
them whenever we encounter such cases, because they are only able to check 
every two or three months, and it often happens that people suffer immensely 
or die in between these visits. Though the government allocates a reasonable 
amount of money to help disadvantaged people like the physically and 
mentally handicapped, the homeless people are neglected. They are considered 
an embarrassment, and both the public and the authorities tend to ignore them. 

Most people are surprised to hear that there are a few thousand homeless 
people in Japan. Almost everyone believes that the homeless are irresponsible, 
lazy alcoholics. Even some of the Margis think so. But the truth is far different. 
Most, or perhaps all of them had great suffering when they lived within the 
normal society. They were rejected or abused, and then in most cases became 
sick. We found them on the whole to be gentle and polite. Though drinking is 
common, few of them are alcoholics. It is presently beyond our capacity to 
establish a permanent center for the homeless, but at least we must find out 
their direst needs, and not allow them to suffer unduly. 88 


88 Over the years that followed, our volunteers probably did save the lives of at least a few very 
ill people who we took to the hospital.

CHAPTER 18 


Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


Like a mountain spring 

Calcutta, 1988. This morning, I left my notebook in the reporting hall just 
outside Baba's room. Side-stepping the security guard, I ran back up the stairs. 
When I was about to burst into the room, I had a shock—Baba Himself was 
sitting there with three workers. I slammed to a halt on the stairway, and pulled 
back just enough to see, but not be easily seen. 

Within a moment, I guessed their purpose: Baba had composed a new song 
and He wanted them to record it. 

This was a sight extraordinaire, a private matter seen by few. I held my 
breath, hoping I wouldn't be noticed. 

Though they spoke in Bengali, I caught the gist. 

"I've composed a new song," Baba said. "Do you want to hear it?" He sat in 
His big chair, they at His feet. 

They turned to each other saying, "I don't want to hear it. Do you?" "No, 
not me." "Another time, Baba." They giggled like children playing with their 
father. He also laughed. 

"Well, I'll sing it anyway," He said. 

"No, no, Baba!" 

He put His finger to His lips to silence them, and began singing only one 
sound: "Na na na na na na na na na...." 

After He finished, He asked, "How do you like the melody?" 

They looked at each other, smiling. "Not very good." "I wouldn't say one of 
Your best." "Don't You have anything better?" 

Then He sang the words. At the time, I felt He was like a mountain 
spring—effortlessly and naturally singing without hesitation or thought. His 
voice was different than I had imagined, different from His speak- 





307 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


mg voice (which is slightly nasal). He played with His voice like an instrument, 
perfect control—mellow, unstrained and pleasing. He had no written notes. 
They feverishly scribbled as He sang, trying to write every word. 89 

When He finished, there were no wisecracks. They were moved by the 
song, moved almost to tears. He waved His hand, and they began singing. At 
first their voices didn't perfectly reflect the melody-each sang in his own way. 
But as they continued, the differences diminished, and they fell into the true 
tune. 

At this moment, the cook was walking by the stairs. Seeing me, he came 
close, whispered "go away," and shooed me away with his hand. I had no 
choice but to leave. I walked down the stairs. A few seconds later, the coast 
clear, I silently came back up. 

Now Baba explained their mistakes, while they buried their faces in their 
notes, correcting them. Again the three of them sang, as baba nodded in 
approval. Even though I didn't clearly understand the song's meaning, by the 
time they came to the final notes, I, too, felt their ecstasy. 

They did prostration, and I knew I'd better get moving to avoid more 
detection. As I dashed out the main door, the security guard raised his 
eyebrows but didn't try to stop me. I looked back and saw the three workers 
walk into General Secretary's room, where I knew they would make a rough 
tape-recording of the song to ensure the melody would not be forgotten. Later it 
would be recorded it again by a skilled singer with instrumental backing. 90 

The Krishna connection 

Tokyo. "One of the gurus of the H are Krishna movement is in Japan now," 
said Dada Ravindranath. It was ten o'clock in the morning. "Do you want to go 
together with me to see him?" 

"I've already had plenty of contact with that religion," I said. "You go 
without me." 


89 

All of Baba's dictation and darshans similarly appeared spontaneous yet perfect. He dictated 
as much as possible for His books— several hoursa day. Heeven dictated while shaving. 
Afterward, when reviewing manuscripts, He only corrected the mistakes of the transcribers, 
and never needed to alter any of H is own words. 

90 

Several times a day Baba called these or other workers to record His new songs, even in the 
dead of the night. He summoned them whenever inspiration struck Him. Each song was 
profound and beautiful. Here I will give just one example. It is the rough 
translation Of song #1494: (continued on next page) 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


308 


One of my closest friends joined Hare Krishna nearly twenty years ago 
when we were in college. At that time he and I shared an apartment, and were 
practicing another yoga technique. We planned to become teachers of that 
technique and open a school in Portland. When he shifted over to worshipping 
Krishna, he tried his best to convince me to do likewise. A few months later I 
found Ananda Marga, and we lost track of each other. After that. I encountered 
the Krishna group in a few other places, but never asked about my friend. 

In the afternoon, while Ravindranathji was at the Krishna temple, I took a 
shower. As usual. I was singing Baba Nam Kevalam. I suddenly had a vision of 
my old friend's face, and a thought clearly passed through my mind: H e is their 
guru now. 

When Ravindranathji returned, I told him about my vision and asked him to 
describe the guru. 

"It'll be easier if I show you their magazine," he said, "because the guru's 
picture is there." 

He opened it to a full page color photo—not only was it my old friend, but 
the facial expression was precisely as I had visualized while taking my shower. 

Without informing my name in advance, I went to the temple today. After 
their ceremonies, during which the devotees garlanded my friend, he turned 
toward me, walked over and we embraced each other. 

"After hardly thinking about you in years," he said, "somehow this morning 
I remembered you. and thought you might come." 

We had a lot to talk about. 


I n the fragrant breeze and sweet garden of my mind 
Come silently, Oh Lord of my heart. 

Noonewill know, I will meditate on You in mymind. 

Y our silent movements will beimperceivable. 

I n the depths of my thoughts I made a garland, 

And have coated each and every petal with sandalwood paste. 
Sitting in contemplation, I have forgotten to sleep. 

Celebrating Your arrival, my mind shivers. 

Incense, lampsand decorations are not needed. 

M y mind strives to merge with the Cosmic M ind. 

In meditation, in mantra, in joy, in enchanting rage, in tunes of love 
I paint myself with Y our colors.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Before his departure from Tokyo, I once more visited my friend, the H are 
Krishna guru. After doing Hare Krishna kiirtan together, we sat down to eat. 
The conversation turned to the books we had given each other three days ago. 

"I read your guru's book, Namami Krishna Sundaram" he said. "For him to 
write such things, he would have had to have most intimate knowledge of 
Krishna's pastimes and Krishna's thoughts. In fact, he would have had to be 
Krishna in a past life!" 

"Perhaps," I said, shrugging my shoulders. "It would be interesting, 
wouldn't it? But then, who am I to know such a thing? Unfortunately, He 
doesn't talk much about His past, what to speak of His past lives." 

A rain of grace 

Chiba, Japan. A good number of Margis, Dadas and Didis participated 
today in a program for about seventy-five handicapped people. This time we 
had a special experience seemingly orchestrated by Baba Himself. 

All of the disabled people were wheelchair dependents. Along with 
volunteers from other service groups, we went by trains and buses to a bunch of 
greenhouses full of bright strawberry plants, where we enjoyed picking and 
eating. After that we moved to a park for our picnic. The Margis were in charge 
of the entertainment. 

Maheshvara of Denmark is a professional clown and dancer. He had the 
whole congregation laughing, until it began drizzling. It looked like the picnic 
and our fun would get spoiled. At that point, everyone started moving toward 
the shelters — everyone, that is, except Maheshvara. He laughingly scolded the 
crowd for having little faith in the will of the Supreme Being. "Come back! 
Come back, and be brave! It is our Cosmic Father's duty to inhale this rain and 
keep our feast alive. He doesn't dare fail us, or else we'll stop believing in 
Him!" Hearing his words, the crowd hesitated, and mumbled among 
themselves. A few started returning to the field — and then all came back. 
Maheshvara shouted, "C'mon, Baba. Show your stuff!" As he continued with 
his show, the light drizzle also continued, but soon ceased. 

For two hours we remained there, laughing, eating, singing and playing 
music together. All that time the sky was dark. From time to time a few more 
drops fell. 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


310 


The program finished and we all filed into the buses. As we drove away, the 
drizzle again started. Windshield wipers washed back and forth at their slowest 
speed. 

The buses arrived at the train station. It took a few minutes to push all the 
wheelchairs inside the station building. Exactly the moment when the last chair 
came under the overhanging, the sky burst open. The very noise of the 
downpour was overwhelming. 

All of us stood there safely under the roof, gaping at the scene. Surely not a 
single one among us doubted that we had witnessed a show of Cosmic grace. 

The unsuppressable living tiger 

Calcutta. Today is the 10-year anniversary of Baba's release from jail. Dada 
Vijayananda gave a talk explaining a little of Ananda Marga's history up to the 
time of His release. Here are my notes from this talk: 

From 1955 to 1961 there were few rules in the organization. All the 
acharyas were family men and women. The work had only a little speed—not 
great speed. Nevertheless, B.M. Malik of the Central Bureau of Investigation 
wrote in his book, "I was instructed by Nehru to be vigilant on two 
organizations and on a particular man. The organizations were the Communist 
Party and the Jan Sangh. And the man was P.R. Sarkar." That was in 1955, at 
Ananda Marga's inception. 

In 1961 the first training center was opened. The speed began to accelerate. 
The first avadhuta was initiated on 19th May, 1963—Baba's birthday. At that 
time the trishula (three-pronged pitch-fork of Shiva) was carried by avadhutas, 
and only later was the lathi (fighting stick) introduced. 

In the early years, I asked Baba if He would have Ananda Marga do service 
activities or not. He said, "Wait. All will come." Then, at the 1963 DMC, Baba 
took some tattered pieces of paper from His pocket. It was the Ananda Marga 
blueprint He had written at the age of sixteen (twenty-six years before). From 
that paper He declared the beginning of the Education Relief and Welfare 
Section (ERAWS). Then He said, "Do something." But for six months, no one 
had any clear idea what to do. At that time, Baba's mother did not want Him to 
write at night, so He had to write in secret by flashlight. In that way He wrote 
the ERAWS guidebook. Then we understood what to do. Accordingly, 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


ton 1st January 1964, the first two grammar schools were opened in J amalpur 
and Ananda Nagar. Over the years, Ananda Marga started more than 1500 
schools. But that first opening ceremony in Jamalpur was simply performed in 
the presence of the Service Department vol-unteers, one mother, two students 
and one snake. Due to the snake, the next day they brought cots for sleeping. 

On 5th March 1967, came the attack on Ananda Nagar during which five of 
our workers were killed. After that, the Communists started a strong vilification 
campaign against Ananda Marga. They told the Hindus that Ananda Marga was 
from East Bengal, and was a Moslem organization. They told the Moslems that 

Ananda Margis were fanatic Hindus. They told the tribals that Ananda Marga 
had come to take their land. They killed goats and pigs to show that Ananda 
Margis ate meat. But young people understood our vitality. Two years later, 

eighteen of our opponents were put in jail for culpability in the Ananda Nagar 
incident. From that point many began to understand that Ananda Marga was 

very strong. 

Mr Roy and three other important barristers made an alliance against 
Ananda Marga. They sent many letters to Indira Gandhi to poison Ananda 
Marga's reputation. They stressed, "This man P.R. Sarkar is dangerous, knows 
many things and can do much mischief. He is building a powerful organization. 
So no time should be wasted in striking against him. Yet remember, if you want 
to make a case against Ananda Marga, you must be very careful, because the 
Margis always find the loopholes." 

On 29th December 1971, eighteen charges and six murder cases were filed 
against Ananda Marga. The following points were highlighted: 

1) Ananda Margis believe in violence. 

2) The source of their funds is doubtful. 

3) Ananda Marga has connection with the American CIA. 

4) Ananda Margis are not morally honest. 

All eighteen charges were dismissed from the court, and the six murder 
cases remained. Ultimately we were exonerated on all those cases in 1978. 

Baba's fast lasted five years, three months and two days. During long 
stretches of that time He took only orange juice twice daily; and during much of 
the time, during the so-called Emergency rule of mar 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


312 


tial law. He took only water. After martial law ended. He took two cups of curd 
water daily. 

The then prison superintendent told me, "Baba is too extraordinary. 
Napoleon could be tackled in jail, but this living tiger cannot be dealt with." 
Baba gave all the jail officials a hot time, demanding that they perform their 
duties properly. The top prison official came to see Baba, thinking that it might 
be his only chance to see this great yogi. Baba covered Himself fully with a 
cloth, so the officer was not even able to see Baba's face. Baba charged him, 
"You are the Jail Magistrate who received my letter, but you took no step on 
my complaint." The official was embarrassed. Then Baba started calling him 
names like "filth, swine, rubbish fellow" and so on. The man became so angry 
he had to rush outside, breathing heavily. 

When announcement of the life-sentence verdict against Baba was given. 
He was on a stretcher. He simply smiled and said. "Now the tables will soon 
turn." One month after that, Indira Gandhi decided to hold general elections. It 
was her greatest misjudgment. A convulsion moved throughout the country 
because so many poor, innocent people had suffered under martial law. 
Especially terrible was Sainjay Gandhi's program of forced sterilization of 
sixteen year old slum boys. Mrs Gandhi's opposition, the Janata Party, received 
the vast majority of the vote. Late that night, Mrs Gandhi called her three top 
military chiefs, and ordered them to continue the Emergency. But they recog¬ 
nized what consequences could follow, and refused to comply. 

On 3rd August 1978 at 6:00 a.m., all the offices and shops within six to 
seven kilometers of the Bankipur Jail in Patna were closed. About 7000 Margis 
arrived the previous night, and were joined by another 10,000. This sea of 
people clogged the streets for two kilometers. At 1:10 p.m. Baba was brought 
out on a stretcher. His weight had dropped from 72 kilograms to 46 kilograms. 
He had also performed a yogi's feat of suspended animation. The usual yogi 
who lives on air does not move at all. Excepting a stretch of eight days. Baba 
did not restrict His movements—though for one year He did not speak, and 
only wrote on a board. After His release. He remained four months in a 
wheelchair; His ankles and knees were too weak to provide support. 



313 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Usually Baba's darshans are appropriate for compilation into book form. 
For example. His Sunday darshans serve as chapters in Shabda Cayanika, an 
alphabetic encyclopedia, packed with original stories and information 
concerning the derivation of thousands of words. 

Today was different. Since it was the 10-year anniversary of Baba's release 
from the jail, His speech was special. It being rare for Him to talk of His 
personal life, I quote the translation of the darshan here in its entirety: 

We did not mean to harm anyone. But when adharmic (unrighteous) 
people use force against you, you must act in self-defense. This is not himsa 
(violence), it is pratirodha (self-defense). Those who opposed us met a pathetic 
end and have now merged with the soil. 

People who follow unrighteousness believe they have the right to do 
anything they want. One lady thought she could do anything she wanted with 
her power. When no reaction comes immediately, sinners think they can get 
away with more. But gaining power, going up, does not mean that they are 
getting elevated. Like the Indian washerman who raises the clothes high over 
his head, they go up very high only to come smashing down. 22 

Some people say that for every action there is an equal and opposite 
reaction. But I do not say that. After time, the reaction is greater because it 
comes with interest. 

Three thousand five hundred Margis and workers were arrested by the 
government. All were innocent, yet the political leaders felt no guilt at all in 
using their power against these innocent people. 

In jail, the Central Bureau of Investigation authorities harassed me in every 
way. For example, there was a rule that when I met with visitors the officers 
could be present, but not within hearing distance. One time, though, a new CBI 
man stood very close, silently listening. I asked him who he was—he replied 
that he was newly appointed. So then I asked him his name and address. He 
became nervous and could not 


91 Eventually I ndira Gandhi was killed by her own security guards, and her thoroughly corrupt 
son, Sainjaya Gandhi, died when his private plane crashed. One day before Indira Gandhi's 
death, Baba asked the meaning of the word assassination. He said that it came from one ass on 
top of another ass, and on top of that is/, and on top of that is the nation. Indira's other son, 
Rajiv Gandhi, then took her place asPrimeM inister, and was later also assassinated—finally 
ending that family's influence on India.

314 


reply. So I shouted and abused him until he ran away. Then the other officers, 
who clearly were aware of this plot, began to criticize that man in order to 
appear innocent. 

But I had bit down so hard while scolding him that two of my false teeth 
broke. The next day, two specialists came from the government hospital to 
replace the broken teeth. I asked them, "How is it that these teeth broke so 
easily?" They replied, "Baba, they are only plastic, they are fragile." But 
according to the prison regulations, the treatment of the eyes and teeth of 
prisoners is their own responsibility, not the government's. I knew these 
specialists had been sent because the officers were feeling guilty at what they 
had done. So I asked them, "How can I chew my food every day with teeth 
given by the sinful government?" Then my personal assistant, Ramananda 
suggested that if we pay them for the work it would be alright, so I agreed. 

When I was released, there was such a long procession—do you 
remember? The jail authorities, seeing the crowds waiting, told me that they 
would also be willing to undergo imprisonment if such a procession would be 
awaiting them on their release. 

I faced so much trouble in the jail. When I was released. I could not walk. 
To go to the toilet I had to hop on my hands like this (He demonstrated). I had 
to use a wheelchair. I remember that my elder sister brought me two luchis 
(small fried breads) and vegetables, but after my long fast I could only eat half 
of one of the luchis with great difficulty. 

I do not want anyone to undergo the same trouble that I did. But in the 
struggle for dharma (righteousness), if some trouble comes, you should accept 
it. If you pick a flower, you may be pricked by its thorns. Your consolation is 
that your struggle will surely end in victory. Our path is klista/dklistd— initially 
there is trouble, but in the end there is no trouble. 

Dharma is the cause of victory. Intelligent people should take the help of 
Dharma. If you want to go to Jammu, you should take a seat on the Jammu 
express train—automatically you will reach there. Similarly you should follow 
the path of Dharma and surely you will be victorious.

Four problems to extinguish 

This incident occurred during the district in-charges reporting ses¬ 
sion of the North Area of the Indian Sector. 

Baba called forward brother Ram Chandra. I was surprised because I 
knew this man tried for several days to arrange his personal contact with 
Baba, but without success. Because he had failed to establish a school, 
he was ineligible. He was also an arrogant fellow, with an argumentative 
nature. 

BABA: Fix your mind at manipura chakra (the navel center). Now 
raise it step by step. To the anahata chakra (heart center). To the 
vishuddha chakra (throat center). To the ajina chakra (third eye)... 
Now, are crude or subtle thoughts coming? 

RAM CHANDRA (standing with eyes closed): Only subtle thoughts, 
Baba. 

BABA: Now, take your mind downward. Vishuddha... anahata... 
manipura ... svadhistana (genital area)... muladhara (bottom of the 
spine). How is your thought now? 

RAM CHANDRA: Baba... material thoughts are coming non-stop. 

BABA: Again take your mind upward ... Wait. What's there at the 
kidney? 

RAM CHANDRA: I've throat trouble, Baba. 

BABA: No. The cause, the initial cause lies in the kidneys. Due to 
malfunctioning in the kidneys, toxic air rises up causing complication in 
the lungs. What's that at the anahata chakra) Did you ever have any 
violent experience in the area of your chest? 

RAM CHANDRA: I received a blow there when I was a student. 

BABA: Do the doctors tell you there is any medical problem? 

RAM CHANDRA: They say I have a peptic ulcer. 

BABA: Then why didn't you ever check it with Dada Vijayananda? 

RAM CHANDRA: Well, well... I thought I had tuberculosis. 

BABA: That's no answer. In fact, TB is there, but it's only developed 
one or two percent. Now, should I give punishment to you alone or in 
front of others? 

RAM CHANDRA: It's up to you, Baba. (He suddenly does pros¬ 
tration at Baba's feet.) 

BABA: Stand up, my boy. Kinshuk, take my stick. (Kinshuk is Baba's 
adopted son.) Touch his left side. (Kinshuk touches his hand 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor

to RC's left side.) No! You must not touch with your hand, only with the 
stick! 

RAM CHANDRA: It burns where he touched me. BABA: Now touch him 
with the stick. (Kinshuk does so.) How does it feel? 

RAM CHANDRA: Oh ... it's very very soothing. 

BABA: I have a pet buffalo I brought up with much care. He can 
enter in any one's body, which is called Parakaya Pravesh. He can also 
enter anyone's mind, which is called Paramana Pravesh. I keep this 
buffalo always with me. Without him, you boys and girls would suffer a 
lot... This boy should have at least contacted the proper persons to ask 
about his problems. You must all be careful of four things: 1) sickness 2) 
enemies 3) debt 4) fire. Whenever any of these arise, you must 
extinguish them completely or they may come back. Let it be as a prin¬ 
ciple in your lives... My buffalo has the eight occult powers and knows 
everything ... You must receive some punishment. What will it be? 

RAM CHANDRA: Any punishment, Baba. 

BABA: From now on you must be a good boy. Accordingly from 
today, you are completely cured. 92 

K ey to the key 

This incident happened during the reporting of North Area full- 
timers. 

BABA: Is there any will power in the protoplasmic cell of a plant, 
animal or human being? (No one answers. Baba points at one brother.) 
You, my boy, come forward. (He walks in front, does prostration, then 
stands.) As you were walking forward, did you feel any twitching in your 
back? 

FULL-TIMER (his face showing anguish): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: As you were walking up the stairway, you felt pain in your 
back. Just upon entering the gate of this house, you felt pain. As you sat 
and stood for your last meal, you felt sharp pain. As you stood up 


92 I inquired about R am Chandra a few months later. A Dada who knew him told me he had 
not only been completely cured, he had also become a model for all the other M argis. Each day 
after completing his normal job, he would dedicate several hours for social work. The units 
under his guidance were becoming more active, and a primary school was started.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


from your last meditation there was discomfort. You could not practice 
yoga postures properly for the last eight days due to the same problem. 
Can you clearly remember each and every one of these moments now? 

FULL-TIMER (smiling): Yes, Baba. BABA: Should we thank 
my flying buffalo? Yesss. Parama Purusha (Cosmic Consciousness) has 
the key of everyone's mind. Only He has the key, and no one else. 
Whenever He likes, He can take away any capacity at any time. If a man 
holding a Ph.D. can speak three langu ages, He can take away the 
capacity for speaking one or two or all three languages, as He likes. So 
what should a human being do? He should surrender to Parama 
Purusha.... Kinshuk, touch the lower middle portion of this boy's back 
with my stick. (Kinshuk does so.) Is the twitching pain now finally gone? 

FULL-TIMER: Yes, Baba! 

BABA: In fact there is no will power in the protoplasmic cells of 
plants, animals and human beings. For the expression of will power, the 
periphery of the doer "I" feeling must be greater than the periphery of 
the done "I" feeling. Nevertheless, you should not forget that the will 
power of Parama Purusha is omnipresent-even within your smallest 
protoplasmic cells. 

Capitalism won't do 

During a reporting session: 

BABA: GS Dada, come forward. Now, just walk across the room in 
the manner of a procrastinator. (The General Secretary begins to walk 
slowly, then hesitates, then walks again, looks around, hesitates, walks a 
little more, and so it continues. We all laugh.) Yesss. GS Da is walking 
just like the procrastinating progress of capitalism. You know, poor 
people cannot contest elections in capitalist countries, for the simple 
reason that one needs to run up a high bill in any successful campaign. 
Will such capitalism, will such so-called democracy, solve the aching 
problems of the people in due time? 

Part of Baba's speech to a group of Margi doctors: 

"As physicians, you must start service cooperatives. These are neither in 
the arena of producers nor consumers co-ops. Rather they are 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


318 


a subtle form of cultural co-ops. These can be called Physicians' Service 
Co-ops. Doctors should research microvita, both positive and negative, 
although they are more concerned with negative. 93 Each and every 
day, several diseases come to this planet through inferential media from 
different celestial bodies. In the course of study, you should find out 
whether there can be a coincidence between the characteristics of 
metazoic cells and multi-cellular protozoic cells in the realm of physi- 
cality and in the psychic sphere. This will help you to find medicines for 
newer and newer diseases. You are not acquainted with many diseases 
which are yet to come to this planet. If you do this research, you will find 
medicines for those ailments yet to come. 

"In the future, neither Communist mania nor philosophical phobia, 
but humanity and intellectuality will rule the earth." 

Will-power Parama Purusha style 

BABA: Kashishvarananda, hold out your right hand. Now, 
Keshavananda, you smell his hand. What do you smell? 

KESHAVANANDA: Sandalwood, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell it again.... What do you get? 

KESHAVANANDA: This time it's jasmine, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell his back.... What is it? 

KESHAVANANDA: Rose, Baba. (I am a few meters away, but even I 
smell it now. It is very sweet. I suppose everyone is catching it.) 

BABA: Shall we allow the smell to continue? If we do, then when 
Kashishvarananda goes for missionary work, the public and Margis will 
wrinkle their noses and say, "Where is that smell coming from?" (Look¬ 
ing at two Dadas on the side of the room who were unable to answer a 
previously asked philosophical question:) You boys, which scent do you 
want to come from your backs? 

TWO DADAS: Whatever Parama Purusha wants. 


93 For thousands of years yogis have declared consciousness to be the fundamental element of 
all entities. Only Baba, however, went into detail on this subject and clearly explained the 
concept of microvita. Microvita are subtle living emanations of the Cosmic Consciousness. They 
serve as the building blocks of matter and life Though several books by Baba and M argis 
elaborate the subject of microvita, they remain a mystery which is gradually unfolding through 
various sorts of research. A footnote cannot adequately explain microvita. 



319 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


BABA: Their answer is an intelligent one. This is a demonstration of 
will-power Parama Purusha-style. 

After we left the room, the sweet rose scent on Kashishvarananda 
was still perceivable by anyone who cared to approach his back. 

I don't remember the cause of Baba's comment during the reporting 
session. I think it was regarding a newspaper article which quoted a 
government minister bragging that the tax-payers had saved much by 
the cancellation of a construction plan. Baba said: 

"It reminds me of Sharmaji's wife's reply. While coming home from 
work, Sharmaji ran after the bus and just missed it. He continued run¬ 
ning, almost caught up, when again it drove away. In the same way, he 
missed it again and again. At last, Sharmaji walked in the door of his 
house and announced to his wife, 'A big part of our financial problems 
are solved. I ran after the bus, missed it again and again, until I finally 
arrived home—thus saving my bus money.' Mrs Sharma replied, 'I'm 
disappointed. Why didn't you run after a taxi and save more money?"' 

An interesting story is circulating here. A few days ago, one Dada 
went to a village in northern India where no other worker had previ¬ 
ously gone. He found many people already practicing Baba Nam 
Kevalam meditation. When he inquired who had taught them, he was 
introduced to a poor, illiterate villager. This man had been a devotee of 
Krishna and Shiva, but he thirsted for a proper guru. Because he could 
not travel, he prayed for the guru to come to him. Baba appeared at his 
house, and initiated him with a mantra and technique, exactly according 
to our system. Baba also taught him all the 16 Points practices of 
Ananda Marga, including tandava and kaoshikii dances. Then Baba 
instructed him to teach Baba Nam Ko/alam meditation throughout the 
surrounding villages. The point of interest is that Baba was in Calcutta 
all the time. 

Soon afterward, this Margi began teaching this simple meditation to a 
few other villagers. He also spoke out against idol worship and castism 
which created a large number of enemies for him in the strict Hindu 
community. One Hindu severely beat him with a stick. The Margi yelled 
at him, "Now surely God will punish you." As the beating con 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


320 


tinued, a snake appeared and bit the Hindu. The Hindu dropped the 
stick and ran to the village center where there was a doctor and also a 
black-magic Tantric. The doctor had no antidote so the black Tantric 
tried to use a mantra, but the poison remained. As the man's body 
turned progressively bluer, the black Tantric told him, "Your only 
chance for recovery lies in your returning to the Margi for his blessing." 
He ran back to the Margi and was told to dance kiirtan, singing Baba 
Nam Ks/alam, with his arms held upward. He did as instructed and 
gradually the blue color gradually left his body, but remained in his 
fingertips. Then the Margi said, "If you take a vow from the heart to 
propagate Ananda Marga, the rest of the poison will leave." The Hindu 
did so and became cured. After this incident, hundreds of villagers 
learned meditation. 

After the Dada returned with this story, two other Dadas were sent to 
the area and confirmed its veracity. Today, Baba was asked for His 
comment, but He only smiled. 94 

Anandamurtiji came to serve the masses 

There was heavy flooding when we arrived at our Tiljala headquar¬ 
ters yesterday. It had been raining heavily since yesterday afternoon. 
Baba arrived only that morning—perfect timing. From the main road to 
our office it is a distance of about one kilometer; I had to walk with my 
luggage on my head. The water level was up to my waist. As I was 
entering, there was a stream of villagers leaving, temporarily abandon¬ 
ing their homes, taking with them whatever belongings and food they 
could manage. 

When I reached our building, some villagers were seeking safety 
from the rain in our four-story office. The Dadas told them they would 
soon be arranging relief materials, but there was no more space in the 
building. It was true. The place was packed with about 500 Margis due 
to various meetings Baba had called. 

Soon after, our electricity and water systems stopped functioning. The 
water level rose up to my chest. We had not prepared any special food 
stocks, and that evening we consumed the last of our meager supplies. 


94 There are many other stories of Baba appearing in two places at once. I hope other 
workers and Margis will write their own books about Baba, and mention their personal 
experience on this subject. 



321 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


No one can enter the area now except by swimming or rowboat. 
Boats, of course, are very few. 

With all this trouble, one might expect a tense atmosphere among the 
workers and Margis. But the level of inspiration seems higher than 
usual; everyone is taking it as an interesting test. 

From the moment I came, Baba has been holding meetings in His 
house as usual. To get there I have to swim, and the water is filthy—an 
oil slick covers the surface. I keep a dry uniform in a plastic bag under a 
chair in His house. During the meetings, He never refers to the flood or 
our present difficulties. For Him, difficulties is something normal. 

Outside of our meetings, He takes hourly reports on the progress of 
our relief programs for the village people. At first we didn't even have 
food for ourselves. Then a small boatload of beaten rice and unrefined 
sugar arrived. This has been our only food. Our relief workers are pro¬ 
viding the same food to the flood victims, and also helping them set up 
temporary shelters on the road. By this evening, the number of recipi¬ 
ents increased to 18,000. Government assistance has still not arrived. 

Three days later. This afternoon the rain finally stopped. Most of us 
stood on the roof as we watched Baba board a boat, which then slowly 
negotiated its way between the flooded houses. A few Dadas swam 
beside the boat. At that very moment the sun came out; it was beautiful. 
A thought passed through my mind: Anandamurtiji came to serve the 
masses. Even the poorest of the poor will reap the benefit. 

A dog joined the Dadas swimming near the boat. When they shooed 
him away, he climbed onto a rooftop sticking out of the water. From this 
vantage he wagged his tail and watched Baba. 

A few thousand villagers stood on the road watching Baba's boat. For 
most of them, it was the first chance to get a close look at this man 
whose fame had spread throughout the world. As His boat pulled up and 
He stepped out, the villagers maintained complete silence, holding their 
hands together in namaskar pose. Everyone's eyes were glued on the 
People's Guru. The dog too was caught in this collective trance. Only at 
the moment that Baba slipped out of view behind a bus, did the dog stop 
wagging his tail and retire from his post. 

Baba had instructed some of the workers, including me, to follow 
Him after the relief work was regularized to His other house in central 
Calcutta. 



Even for the Poorest of the Poor 


322 


Next day. We are now in central Calcutta. I heard that at last the 
government's relief team arrived in Tiljala. The villagers were so frus¬ 
trated with the slowness of government help that they shouted, "We 
would have died without the assistance of Ananda Marga!" To demon¬ 
strate their anger, they dumped the first delivery of government food 
into the flood waters. 

Two days later. We sometimes hear suspicions voiced regarding the 
source of Ananda Marga's finances. So how did we get money for these 
relief operations? Food, medicine and miscellaneous assistance for 
18,000 flood victims is no small matter. 

Though our relief department promised the public their minimum 
necessities, our relief teams had almost no money in the beginning. 
Practically speaking, the guarantees we made to serve the needy public 
fully depended on Baba's grace. That might seem foolish, but we had 
faith that He would provide what was required. The team leader, Dada 
Ramananda, personally approached Margis and workers for donations 
from the first to the last day. A few days ago, I gave him as much as I 
could, but when he left my room, he said, "It's still far from enough. I 
really don't know how we'll manage tomorrow." When I saw him the 
next day, he smiled at me. "Yesterday, shortly after I met you, I ran into 
one of the richer villagers, who owns a car which we saved from the 
flood waters. I expressed our financial problems, and he gave me 
enough money for an entire day's supplies. In relief work, we are forced 
to count on at least one or two miracles a day." 

I mproving agricultural and industrial production 

Dada Vijayananda gave a class today explaining many of Baba's 
suggestions about how to increase agricultural and industrial produc¬ 
tion, especially in developing countries. Excerpts from my notes not 
only provide some practical ideas, but also show Baba's concern for 
overcoming poverty. 95 

[Author's note: These notes are somewhat detailed. Interested read¬ 
ers are referred to the article "On increasing agricultural production" in 
the appendix Technical talks by Baba or with Baba. At the end of 


95 Later a book was printed of Baba's agricultural ideas called Ideal Farming. 



323 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


this class were a few points of general interest regarding improving the 
industrial output in poor regions:] 

Baba supports the idea of synthetic fibers. He warns that Bengal will 
soon be in danger because it is too dependent on jute fiber and animal 
hide. Due to synthetic fibers, the jute industry will soon be a thing of the 
past. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Baba 
explained that it is better to convert to the production of jutewool. 
Jutewool is a combination of jute and wool. He does not appreciate the 
slogan from the days of Mahatma Gandhi — "science is the monster of 
civilization." Rather, for all those in danger of losing their jobs Baba 
proposed a demand: "Let every sub-division have a jutewool industry, 
and let the weavers be supplied with power looms. Thereby both the 
farms and the weavers will receive the proper wages." 

In India paper is expensive because it is imported. To improve the 
paper industry, He gave a list of twenty good plants. These include bam¬ 
boo, different kinds of grass, and mesta jute sticks. 

Bran is usually wasted simply as a fuel. Part of the bran is good for 
manufacturing oil, and the rest should be used as an element in making 
cement (along with lime). 

Until now politics has dominated the economy. But economics 
should dominate politics. If any politician does little to improve the 
people's living standard, then he should be dismissed. 

[Author's note: A few days later, Baba gave a number of points to 
which all Margi district in-charges must pay attention when making 
their planning. These points may be found in the article "Grassroots 
planning", located in the appendix Technical talks by Baba or with 
Baba.]

CHAPTER 19 


Working 24 H ours a Day 

Saving plants 

Delhi, 1989. Today, as I arrived at the airport with three large boxes 
containing my sector's quota of 600 plants , I was compelled to undergo 
a complex customs process. 96 Two officials insisted that twelve of my 
plants were forbidden by law. Because these happened to be my most 
expensive plants, I was sure they were lying, with the intention of selling 
the plants afterwards. Officers commonly indulge in this sort of 
corruption. My argument to keep the plants thus fell on deaf ears. 

They had already removed the expensive plants, and I was awaiting 
their final okay to leave. When their backs were turned, I silently ex¬ 
changed cheap plants for the expensive ones. A moment later, they 
handed me the authorization. As quickly as possible, I made my way 
through the rest of customs, and jumped into a taxi. Just as the taxi was 
pulling out, I noticed one of the officials run out and anxiously look 
around. 


“Since 1981, each of the eight sectors outside of the Indian sector, and each of the ten regions 
inside of the i ndian Sector was required to deposit about 600 plants monthly with the Calcutta 
office. In addition, each time any worker reported to Calcutta, she or he was required to 
personally deliver a number of extra plants. In total, about 13,000 plants were brought every 
month. 

The plants were not brought arbitrarily, but according to specific lists provided by Central 
Headquarters. These included seedlings and small cuttings of flowers, vegetables, medicinal 
herbs, fibers, spices, cosmetic plants, plants on the verge of extinction, fruit trees and other trees. 
For example, at the time of this entry, Hong K ong sector was requested to bring Acasia 
Triacantus, Taiwan Calmanis. Serissa Foetida, Yellow Palm, CalamisFormosana, Cryptomeria 
I apanica, and J apanese Cherry. Calcutta would then distribute the plants to different M aster 
Units of I ndia, and to some extent overseas. Now our botanical gardens rank among the largest 
of India.

Languages of the world 

[Author's note: In today’s workers' meeting, Baba spoke at great 
length about languages around the world. He frequently spoke on this 
subject. Even when speaking about something else, He commonly went 
on linguistic detours, explaining the derivation of important words. I 
include these notes not because they are exceptional, but to give an 
example of a lecture on His pet subject.. However, the matter is highly 
technical and so the reader is referred to the article "On the evolution of 
languages throughout the world" in the appendix Technical talks by 
Baba or with Baba.] 

Philosophy becomes reality 

Calcutta. A few days ago, while taking the train from Delhi, I sat next 
to Dada Devashraddhananda, who is working in the USA. Though he is 
a dynamite worker, he couldn't help but mention to me about his health 
problems. He said, "I'm suffering so much for so long, I don't know how 
I can take it any longer. Why doesn't Baba free me from this hectic 
lifestyle of constant touring and post me to supervise a farm on a Master 
Unit, or something like that?" 

"Why do you worry?" I said. "Baba knows everything, and is treating 
you and all of us perfectly. When He wants to cure you, He will. 
Otherwise we have to simply keep tasting the fruits of your past actions, 
whether they be sweet or sour." I knew my words were blunt, but here 
was an elevated man who would understand my meaning. 

"You're just speaking philosophy," he said, "and I'm suffering." 

Hearing this, what could I say? 

After we came in Guru's presence, Devashraddhanandaji's attitude 
changed. Smiling, laughing, enjoying Baba—He seemed unaware of his 
own suffering. 

Baba called me out of line to answer a few questions. Then He also 
called Devashraddhanandaji forward. After two or three questions, 
Baba's mood suddenly changed. "Devashraddhananda, stand straight. 
Do you know that there is a defective functioning of your urinary tract?" 

"Yes, Baba." (Later, Dada told me he hadn't really known, but was 
only saying so.) 



Working 24 Hours a D/\ y 


"You should take only liquid diet in the evening. Do you 
understand?" "Yes, Baba." 

Baba told us to step back, and continued the session. I looked at 
Devashraddhanandaji—he was beaming a million rupee smile. 

Criteria for board member 

Baba was listening to the report of one of the workers' boards : 97 
BABA: During the last one month, this board did nothing significant. 
Should a chair or a table be a member of this board? What do you say? 

DADA WHO IS MEMBER OF THE BOARD: Perhaps we achieved 
nothing, Baba, but we were active, and we met regularly. 

BABA (getting a little angry): What do you mean to say? Should a 
ceiling fan be a member of the board? 

F rom the perspective of P rout 

Today Baba expressed some points on Prout. There may be some 
small mistakes in my notes: 

Regarding the case of Salaman Rushdie's book Satanic Verses, i.e., 
Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini demand for Rushdie's death because of the 
book's criticism of Islam and Mohammed, Baba commented: 

Prout does not support the suppression of any popular sentiment. If 
it is suppressed then some people may think there is some value in it. 
Hence suppression only helps to keep the idea alive, and it will manifest 
in different ways later. If the Proutists believe that a particular popular 
sentiment is harmful to the path of human progress, they should 
encourage the idea to be brought into the public light so that it may be 
countered by logic and reason. A constructive alternative should be 
presented. Thus negative energy is channeled in a positive way. Of 
course, this does not deny the importance of legal defamation 
guidelines. 

Regarding the economic development of a nation, Baba gave six points: 
l) Maximum industries should be developed in local areas according to 
the availability of raw materials for local consumption. (This is 


97 This brief conversation is included as an example of a Baba-style criticism during review- 
meetings. 



327 Travels with the Mystic Master 

diametrically opposed to the present policy of every country in the 
world.) 

2 ) Finished products which can he locally produced should not be 
imported. 

3) No country should invest significantly in industries which depend on 
imported raw materials. 

4 ) The first step to decentralized planning is to make an economic 
plan according to the needs of the lowest level, i.e. block-level 
planning for areas having about 100,000 people. 

5) In pure economic terms, developmental promts are those 
projects which directly and indirectly increase nations wealth. 

6) The more government revenue is spent on development projects, 
not including the salaries of government employees, the better it is 
for the country's economy. 

[Author's note: At this point, Baba went on to give a detailed 
explanation regarding the way for Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest 
nations, to solve its economic problems. Refer to the aricle "On solving 
Bangladesh's economic problems" in the appendix Technical talks by 
Baba or with Baba.] 

Go on thinking deeply 

[Author's note: During a workers' meeting, Baba asked me some 
ques- tions about microvita, the mysterious emanation of the Cosmic 
Mind. I tried my best to answer, and He gave some hints for further 
contemplation of this complex subject. About two weeks later, 1 was in 
Taiwan. It was 3:00 in the morning, and I was struggling to stay awake 
while answering the questions of one of our Margi scientists. Suddenly I 
had a long stream of thoughts on the same subject. These diary entries 
are combined into the article "On microvita" in the appendix Technical 
talks by Baba or with Baba.] 

Forever with H im 

For about one year, access to Baba has much more limited. 
Previously, Baba's door was usually open during meetings and reporting 
sessions. Those who couldn't fit inside His room would stand outside, 
looking in. During this past year, however He has allowed the door to stay 
open only once or twice a day. At all other times, we have 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


had to communicate with Him by yelling under His door. In one way it is 
humorous; in another it's painful. 

Humorous? Well, take the moments when He becomes angry (which 
are not infrequent). Atonement is required for those workers who fall 
short of their targets or for any number of other logical or illogical 
reasons. In such cases, the General Secretary should beat the worker 
with a stick. In fact what happens is that, yes he beats alright, but he 
beats any notebook or book that the "guilty" Dada holds, while that Dada 
makes crying and sighing sounds. Pretending to be tormented by the 
whipping, the Dada yells "Oh, Baba!," "I shall improve," "We'll open an 
orphanage within one week," or whatever is the appropriate reply. Baba 
sometimes shouts back: "Does he repent, GS?," "Scoundrel!," "How does 
he intend to rectify the situation?," and so on. Commonly, however, He 
remains silent while the drama proceeds at a Tantric pace. If the 
excitement fades away, He may pipe up, "Eh, GS? What does that 
nonsense fellow have to say for himself?" 

To an outsider it would seem absurd. But for us, because we un¬ 
derstand at least a little of the purpose behind the drama, we tolerate it— 
or, as in my case, even enjoy it. 

A few days ago, I saw Dada Asiimananda (Central Farm secretary, 
one of our most elevated and respected monks) sitting alone outside 
Baba's door. While Baba was shouting a long series of directives under 
the door, Dada would occasionally reply through that same crack, "Yes, 
Baba!," while he was busy consuming a snack. He had obviously adapted 
to the pressure. He had also found a way to adjust with being so busy 
that he had no time for a meal. 

Personally I feel nostalgic for those days when the beating was genu¬ 
ine. It generated a perceivable tension, a smellable fear, which hung in 
the air—and that added to the seriousness of our work. I suppose Baba 
now wants our motivation to depend less and less on external pressure. 
We must derive our inspiration from our hearts, while feeling the 
pressure of our conscience. 

Nowadays the non-Central workers, like me, are usually invited to 
come near Baba's door only a few minutes a day, and occasionally to 
enter. So I am constantly seeking to find new justifications for being 
near His door. For example: "I must speak to my Central departmen 



329 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


tal secretary," or "I was told by so-and-so to wait here —What?—No, I 
don't know why." At other times, like today, I run out of excuses and 
resort only to melancholic contemplation. My eyes becoming watery and 
doe-like and I mutely turn them on any Dada who challenges me for 
violating protocol. Though these Dadas have great responsibilities, they 
are still fundamentally devotees, so the doe-eyes often silence them. 

It was 1:30 p.m., and for some unknown cause most workers were 
away from the Cosmic nucleus. Even those who were present had 
slipped away for lunch. Only one other Dada, Ganadevanandaji, re¬ 
mained with me outside the closed door. 

When Baba rang His call-bell, His personal assistant, Dada 
Keshavananda, ran from his office, opened the door, popped his head in, 
and said, "Yes, Baba." Baba said nothing. The other Dada and I, 
crouched at the feet of Keshavanandaji, had a clear view of Him resting 
on His side, facing us. He appeared to be sleeping. He's so beautiful, I 
thought, like the tiniest baby. 

"Yes, Baba!" Keshavanandaji said again. When no reply came, he 
slowly and noiselessly shut the door. 

"You two should not be here," he whispered. 

"Ah ... but, Dada ... couldn't you? ... just this time? ..." My eyes 
watered, Ganadevanandaji's mouth quivered, and we each held one of 
Dada's hands. 

Though it was one of our best performances to date, he shook his 
head. "No, no, I can't allow it. You know the system." 

Slowly, ever so slowly, with expressions of heart-wrenching anguish, 
we began edging backwards, away from the Cosmic Door. Keshava¬ 
nandaji stood his ground, waiting to see that we would really leave. 

When we were just on the verge of leaving, the sound of the call-bell 
cut the air. Keshavanandaji reopened Baba's Door. "Yes, Baba?" 

By this time we were again huddled at the Doorway, staring into the 
king's chamber. His position was the same, His innocent face a bare two 
meters away from us. Again Keshavanandaji called, again no response, 
again without a sound he shut the mystic entrance. 

And again he turned on us, "You shameless fellows!" he yelled in a 
whisper. We smiled glumly, not showing our teeth, mentally pleading 
for mercy. 

"No. Out. Out!" 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


330 


Our heads and shoulders bent, feet dragging like lead, we tortoised 
our way toward the stairway. Step by step, inch by inch, slowly, slowly- 
dreading to face-the other world.... 

And then again! Saved by the bell. "What is this?" Keshavanandaji 
muttered. In a? flash we were nestled behind his feet as he opened the 
gateway to paradise. 

"Baba, kill " he said loudly. There He lay, more peaceful than ever, 
unresponsive to Dada's worn-out query. Dada turned his eyes toward 
heaven, then looked at us. "Alright. Call me the moment that Baba 
wakes up. I don't know what His game is today." He walked away, 
leaving the Door open! 

Baba, thank you.. . I thought. Hardly believing our luck, but under¬ 
standing "His game", we sat down comfortably. Of course, His game was 
that we should have his uninterrupted darshan—to see Him without the 
slightest distraction of reports or talks or background chatter, without 
even the slightest movement or change inside the room. We gazed at His 
face, at His hands, at His body—and entered into an indescribable, 
transcendent dimension. My ego-centered mind drifted away, replaced 
by a long peaceful wave of tranquillity. Deeper, deeper, I became lost in 
the thought of Him; nothing remained of me. 

After what seemed like measureless time, something stirred within 
me, like a thin, almost invisible shadow. A feeling arose, increased and 
surged upward from my stomach, tearing at my heart. Tears flowed in a 
steady stream, my mouth grimaced uncontrollably, my body shook, and 
my mind screamed, Baba! Baba! Meanwhile, He lay there, yet un¬ 
moving—affecting me more by His silence than by anything He might 
say or do. Every muscle, every nerve tensed, as waves of emotion 
wracked my being. I struggled not to shout, not to move, and not to 
faint. My feelings rushed like tidal waves; the blood throbbed against my 
temples; and my brain—what words should I use?—my brain swooned, 
demanded relief.... I could not think, but I knew, / am with Baba, have 
been so forever, and will be so forever. 

"Okay, Dadas," a soft voice said. "You've been here almost two 

hours." 

I looked upland saw Keshavanandaji. He smiled tenderly, knowingly. 
I didn't resist. As I got up, my legs trembled, unable to hold my weight. I 
held onto the wall. Ganadevanandaji also stood up. Baba,

who all this while had faced us unmoving, now rolled over to His other 
side, turning away from us. It was a perfect ending as Keshavanandaji 
gently closed the Cosmic Gate. 

Once downstairs and outside, we looked at each other. What did he 
experience? we each thought. But neither of us asked nor spoke. W e 
only smiled, and arm-in-arm walked silently down the road toward the 
coconut-water man. 

H is responsibility beyond the earth 

Today while I was sitting outside Baba's door, I asked a senior Indian 
worker, Dada Shubbhabodhananda, to tell me the most special 
experience he'd had of Baba. This was his story: 

"It was one year ago during a DMC tour in India. As the secretary 
general of the Service Department, it was my duty to oversee the secu¬ 
rity arrangements. One morning, at 3:00,1 woke up and decided to 
check everything. First I made sure that the two guards were both vigi¬ 
lant. Then I walked around to the rear of the house. Baba's room was 
there, and the window looking into His room had the curtains drawn 
back somewhat. I looked in, but He wasn't there. Hmmm. Perhaps He 
had gone to the bathroom? I walked over to the bathroom window and 
listened. Nothing. Very peculiar. Where could Baba have gone? I walked 
back to the big window of His bedroom, but He still was not there. For 
some minutes I stood there gazing in the window, wondering and 
wondering. 

Suddenly I became aware of the slight shadow of a figure in the 
center of the room. As I watched, the vague shape became more and 
more definite. It was a man sitting in meditation. Finally I realized it 
was Baba. Where there had previously been nothing, He materialized. 

The next morning I was full of curiosity, hoping for some opportu¬ 
nity to ask Baba about the night before. Baba called me in alone to 
perform massage. Shortly after I began, He asked, "Do you have some 
question?" 

"Baba, last night, You know I was there. What was that?" He smiled 
and said, "Do you think I only have responsibility on this one planet?"

The trouble is mutual 

Ananda Nagar. Today Dada Svarupanandaji (the principal of our 
college here and one of our most senior Dadas) told me a couple of 
stories from his early days in Ananda Marga: 

After my initiation, but before I became an acharya, I visited the yoga 
center of the famous elderly lady saint Ananda Mayi Ma. At that time, 
Baba was not well known, so I did not inform anyone there that I was a 
Margi. 

I sat together with the other devotees in front of Ma. She called me 
forward, and said, "You are very lucky. Anandamurti is the greatest guru. 
As for me, I will not be able to go to Him for a long long time." 

I was shocked by her psychic ability to know my guru, and thrilled by 
her praise of Baba. "I can convey your namaskar to Him if you wish," I 
said. 

"Thank you. It is my wish." 

Later, when I met Baba, and passed Ananda Mayi Ma's namaskar. 

He returned the namaskar, and commented, "Yes. She is a good girl." 

Another occasion, also before I was an acharya, I was together with 
Baba at night. Though we were walking, His mind was obviously far 
away. Taking advantage of His transcendental state, I stole two rupees 
from His pocket. Afterward, I used that money to buy sweets and 
brought them to the tiger's grave where three of us sat with Baba. We all 
enjoyed the sweets. Then Baba said to me, "You are only a student, and 
couldn't afford these sweets. I'll give you the money." I replied, "No, 
Baba, it wasn't my money... I stole it from You." Baba looked at me 
sternly and said, "From Guru you stole? You must be punished.... But I 
cannot give you punishment because I also indulged in the stolen goods." 

During those early years, (Svarupanandaji continued) one could 
often see Him enter into trances and different special states of being, just 
like other highly elevated spiritualists. But He is not like others, because 
He never studied under any guru, and He passed through all His 
personal realizations as a youth. After that, I mean for the last thirty 
years or so, He always appeared in total control of Himself-even though 
He's busy raising the kundalini force (spiritual energy) of so many other 



333 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


people. And busy making trouble for us. Well, of course, we're also 
nicely skilled in making trouble for Him. 

M icrovita demo 

Exactly seventeen years ago I first came to this spiritual paradise. I 
have to use the adjective spiritual because it is certainly not a physical 
paradise. Nevertheless, even physically it is far better off than when I 
first saw it. At that time it was a near-desert, without electricity or 
running water, and almost devoid of buildings. Now it is crawling with 
schools, welfare homes, dormitories, medical centers, small industrial 
plants, farm buildings, and offices. Most of these buildings have elec¬ 
tricity and running water—all provided by our own power plants, 
damns, bio-gas systems and solar cells. About 3000 of the local tribal 
people participate or are employed in construction, cottage industry or 
agricultural development projects in Ananda Nagar. And yet, so far, the 
government has not helped us in the slightest. 

The most impressive change, however, is in the natural environment. 
As I said, it used to be a near-desert. Its small streams would run dry in 
the summer. Now, even in the driest time of the sweltering summer, the 
river is not only running, its water is deep enough for swimming. 
Although in this very moment a severe drought affects all of northern 
India, Ananda Nagar is an oasis, full of green-leafed trees and bushes. 
Rain falls at least on a semi-regular basis. 

How did this happen? I cannot be sure. Is it the special trees and 
plants here, which Baba specified for attracting rain clouds? Or the 
system of rivers and drainage which catches rainwater to avoid its run¬ 
ning into the ground? Or is it some sort of special spiritual grace? 

(During a reporting session:) 

BABA: Any effect may be achieved by causing a concentration of the 
relevant microvita. And those microvita may be transported by any of a 
number of different means. For example ... my boy, step forward. (A 
Dada walks close to Baba.) The microvita causing thermal generation 
may be conveyed by the tactual factor. (Baba uses one finger to touch 
the Dada's anahata chakra or chest.) Now how do you feel, my boy? 
DADA: Very hot, Baba. There are waves of heat. BABA: Acha. (Baba 
touches him again.) And now? 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


334 


DADA: My body's coming back to normal, Baba. 

BABA: These microvita may also be conveyed by the ocular faculty. 
(As usual, throughout the last few minutes, Baba was hardly looking at 
anyone, even while speaking with particular persons. Now he looks very 
specifically at the Dada.) How do you feel now? 

DADA: I feel super hot, Baba. 

BABA: Do you want to go on enjoying this state? 

DADA: Ah (he smiles, though clearly very uncomfortable)... what¬ 
ever Baba likes. 

BABA (again looking in an obvious way at the Dada): It would be 
dangerous for your cells to remain in this agitated condition for long. 
That is why I am now withdrawing the microvita. Well? 

DADA: Thank you, Baba. 

BABA: No, no. It was done by your grace alone. 

J umping cure 

The Central Secretary of the Education, Relief and Welfare Section, 
Dada Paripurnananda, is a good friend of mine. Recently, Baba has been 
very hard on him. I feel proud of Paripurnanandaji, because no matter 
what sort of clash Baba gives him, he seems to take it nicely. Now in the 
middle of a scolding, Baba's mood suddenly shifted. 

BABA: I believe you have some problem with your knee. Is it so? 
PARIPURNANANDA (smiles sweetly, enjoying this change in Baba's 
attitude): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: GS Da, apply your hands to his left knee, massaging gently. 
(The General Secretary does so.) Is it somewhat cured now? 

PARIPURNANANDA: Yes, Baba. It is maybe thirty percent better. 
BABA: Now you should leap in the air as high as possible. 
(Paripurnanandaji hesitates a moment, wondering if he understood cor¬ 
rectly, as it seems a strange way to cure a knee problem. Then, shrugging 
his shoulders in surrender, he jumps almost one meter up.) Jump again. 
And again. Now, describe the condition. 

PARIPURNANANDA (with an enormous smile): I believe it is one 
hundred percent cured, Baba. 

BABA: Just see, just see. But do I remember hearing one little boy 
thinking, "Baba loves those two other Dadas. He doesn't love me.?" 
Hmmm, did anyone think that? 

PARIPURNANANDA (softly): Yes, Baba, I was thinking so... but... 



335 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


BABA: But what? Is it so that Baba does not love the little boy who 
was thinking so? 

PARIPURNANANDA (looking affectionately at Baba): No. Baba 
loves him very much. 

BABA: Perhaps your assumption is correct. Yes, I think it may be 
correct. 

Global Weatherman 

Calcutta. Dada Pranavatmakananda told me that on 2nd June, dur¬ 
ing a workers' meeting, Baba mentioned, "The panorama of the world is 
going to undergo a very fast change. You all should be ready...." 

Yesterday in Vishnupur, Pranavatmakanandaji said to Baba, "Three 
days ago You said the world's panorama is going to undergo a big 
change. Baba, in that time so much happened. On 3rd June, Ayatollah 
Khomeini, the revolutionary mullah of Iran died. On 4th June, Com¬ 
munism was voted out of power in Poland—the first country to reject it. 
Also on 4th June, when the military attacked the peaceful protesters in 
Tiananmien Square, Communism stood exposed in China as a system 
that can only be maintained by brute force. It seems that Your 
prediction of communism's downfall is beginning to be fulfilled." 

"You wait and see," Baba said. "The world will be dumbstruck to 
witness the pace of change. Before you reach your sector, there will be 
much more change in the world." 98 

Real dreams 

Dada Pranavatmakananda toled me a story he heard from two other 
Dadas: Nityasatyanandaji and Haratmanandaji. They were both sleep¬ 
ing in the same room in Sao Paolo, Brazil, when Nityasatyanandaji had a 
dream: 

He was on a field walk with Baba. At one point, their way became 
obstructed by mud. Dada thought, "If Baba walks through this mud, His 
legs will become dirty." So he lifted Baba, carried Him across, and then 
put Him down. Then he woke up. 

He noticed that their room was full of a sweet lotus scent. He was so 
excited that he shook Dada Haratmananda to wake him up and asked 


98 Pranavatmakanandaji reached his sector a few months later. During that time, Communism 
collapsed in the whole of E astern Europe. 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


336 


him, "Do you smell anything in this room?" Dada replied, "Yes ... it's like 
a lotus flower ... very sweet." After this, both Dadas forgot about the 
incident. 

Nine months later, Nityasatyanandaji was in Calcutta. It was his 
daily routine to wait for Baba in the garden. When Baba would come out 
of the house, Dada would sing the latest Prabhat Sangiit song. One day 
Baba turned toward him and said, "If you had not lifted me that day, my 
legs would have become dirty." He smiled and walked away. 
Nityasatyanandaji was surprised. He went on singing but could not un¬ 
derstand what Baba meant. He remembered nothing. 

Two days later when Dada was returning to South America, he sud¬ 
denly recalled that night and understood Baba's words. He wept with 
love for Baba. 

At another time, Haratmanandaji was alone with Baba, massaging 
Him. Somebody had told him that Baba's navel area produced a special 
scent. When Baba was sleeping, Haratmanandaji lifted Baba's un¬ 
dershirt out of curiosity. Baba woke up and said, "Nonsense fellow! 
What are you doing?" 

Again He slept. More careful this time, Haratmanandaji lifted the 
undershirt. Baba woke up while Dada was sniffing. But this time He 
smiled and asked, "What do you smell?" 

"It's sweet, Baba." 

"Is it like a lotus?" 

"Yes." 

"Have you seen pictures of the mythological Vishnu which show a 
lotus sprouting from his navel, and on top of the lotus flower Brahma is 
sitting, creating the whole universe?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"It is symbolic. Parama Purusha (the Supreme Consciousness) cre¬ 
ates all, and His nucleus, His creative faculty is the navel. As His navel 
produces a lotus smell, mythology shows it so. Do you remember this 
scent?" 

"What do you mean, Baba?" 

"Do you remember when you were sleeping in the same room as 
Nityasatyanandaji, and he woke you up? It was exactly that smell." It is 
clear that for Baba, our dreams of Him are also part of reality.

Lost in their own lies 

[Author's note as a background to today's entry: In 1982 the Tripura 
state government, at that time communist, tried to crush Ananda 
Marga. Some of their leading politicians openly stated they would "oust 
the socio-political organization Ananda Marga." Soon after, one of our 
primary schools was bombed. A court case was filed and the judge's de¬ 
cision went against us so we appealed in the High Court. At that time, 
the communists held 54 seats in the State Assembly out of 60. Most of 
the public used to treat Chief Minister Chakravorty like a god. How 
could we expect to win? But Baba said at that moment, "When the 
sinner reaches the climax point, downfall is certain." We sent 500,000 
leaflets and 200,000 posters to this small state of less than two million 
inhabitants. Finally in the High Court, the District Magistrate apolo¬ 
gized for obstructing our school. The High Court instructed the police 
and the government agents to leave our school undisturbed. Not long 
after, the communist government was defeated by the Congress Party. 

The West Bengal government's (also communist) reaction to our 
work in Ananda Nagar was similar. In 1987, Baba told us, "The wind is 
blowing in your favor." He also said, "Complete every work immediately, 
as time is short." Highest priority went to developing Ananda Nagar. In 
short time, the near-desert scene dramatically changed. It must have 
terrified the federal and state governments to see Ananda Marga 
creating a beautiful community in one of the poorest areas of India. If 
we succeeded, it would prove the government's inefficiency and 
insincerity. The local communist party leader announced to the press, 
"Just as we drove out the Lutheran Universalist Mission, we will also 
drive out Ananda Marga."] 

In Ananda Nagar this year there have been almost daily attacks on 
our staff, destruction of our agricultural work or harm to our buildings. 
Ananda Nagar is about 1200 acres, and these attacks have mostly 
occurred on the outskirts. Four months ago, at midnight, the police 
destroyed one of our buildings, declaring it the property of the Forestry 
Department. The police claimed they seized weapons from Ananda 
Marga. We denied it. They often make such claims. We are compelled to 
repeatedly file court charges, and eventually always win. It seems a 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


338 


never-ending process. By now, the general people doubt any negative 
news published about us. In this case, our statement in the court was, 
"Why didn't the police destroy the building in the daytime, if it were 
really the government's building?" We won the case. 

The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu, became furious-he 
openly hates Ananda Marga. The step he decided on was excessive. 
Yesterday he approved an attack hoping to drive out Ananda Marga. The 
District Magistrate sent a message to Jyoti Basu, "If we raid Ananda 
Nagar, we can expect a fight just like the Sikhs waged at the Golden 
Temple." They sent 1500 police and 153 vehicles to Ananda Nagar. They 
even brought ambulances to take care of the wounded. Apparently there 
was so much propaganda against us for so long, that the opposition 
believed their own lies about us. They thought we had a huge number of 
machine guns and explosives. But what did this overwhelming military 
force find? Nothing. Nevertheless, in a press conference just after the 
raid, the police claimed they discovered numerous weapons. 

Today our Public Relations secretary filed a court case against the 
West Bengal government and police. In the history of West Bengal, no 
case was ever filed against top police officers. The PR secretary also held 
a press conference, and showed the police seizure lists which proved 
that they found nothing. The media representatives were astonished; 
they had published the false news only yesterday. Today they printed 
the true story. 

Working 24 hours a day 

During the last few days of reporting, Baba did not sit with the rep¬ 
resentatives. Each time He comes back from field walk, everyone greets 
Him as He steps out of the car, then those who have reporting duty run 
into the main room to be ready in case He wants to take their report. 
Though we've regularly followed this procedure, our sense of despon¬ 
dency deepens as the days pass and He seems to ignore us. 

This morning there was a feeling of resignation among many work¬ 
ers. "Surely again He will not sit with us." Our crisp readiness was so 
absent that this time the main room was full of Margis and workers who 
were not supposed to be there, and no one had made any effort to shoo 
them out. 



339 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Together with everyone else, I greeted Baba at His car. As He slowly 
walked away, moving toward the side entrance, one brother approached 
me. "Dada, I've completed the paper-work that you wanted me to do. 
Here it is." I was torn between going through the documents and going 
to the room, just in case this time Baba wanted our report. But if I didn't 
take the papers it might make trouble for this brother. I took the 
material and quickly checked it. In this way, perhaps a minute passed. 

Then I rushed toward the room. A mad scene was taking place at the 
door! Margis and other workers were scrambling to squeeze out, 
everyone trying to get out at the same time. Though I could hear Baba 
shouting inside, there was no way I could enter at that moment. A gap 
appeared, and I jumped forward, pushing violently against the others, 
and forgetting all politeness. Just as I reached the door those inside 
began closing it. I thrust in my arm, and then a leg, and with a burst of 
strength, pressed it open, and squeezed into the room. 

The very instant I entered Baba looked at me, burning me with His 
inner fire. As the last to enter, I was the most irresponsible element in 
this entire brew of feckless workers. But instead of hiding behind the 
others, I stepped toward the front. I love His attention, no matter what 
sort. 

"Nonsense! Stupid! Scoundrel!" He shouted at me. "Breeding chaos! 
Like animals! Idiot! Rascal!" I bathed in His force. "How can you waste 
my time? Don't you know that I am working twenty four hours a day?" 
His words stabbed at me with a power and a volume I had never before 
experienced. Surely even the neighbors could clearly hear His voice 
through the now closed door. The other workers turned their faces to¬ 
ward me, wondering how I would take this scorching chastisement. I 
suppose they thought me arrogant, because instead of bowing my head 
in abasement, I looked straight at Baba. He was dead right, I was some¬ 
times wasting my time and His time, but in that moment I did not care 
because Baba was directing a colossal force at me, and I did not want to 
miss a drop of it. 

He stood up from the sofa. A sinking sense of disappointment surged 
through the workers as they understood that this opportunity for a long- 
awaited meeting with Baba was spoiled. As He left the room everyone 
became gloomy and turned their eyes toward the floor. Every 



Working 24 Hours a Day

one, that is, except me. I was elated with the shakti, the spiritual power 
He had injected into me. But, knowing the others would not understand, 
I neither smiled nor said anything. I was, after all, the one deserving 
maximum blame. 

His voice echoed again and again in my mind: "Don't you know that I 
am working twenty four hours a day?" 

Society's high expectations 

(During the meeting of the district incharges from Area West of the 
Indian Sector. A Margi stands in front of Baba.) 

BABA: GS, ask him how many full-timers he created. 

GENERAL SECRETARY: How many full-timers did you create in the 
last one year? 

MARGI: None. 

BABA (now directing his words at the Margi): How many schools have 
started due to your own efforts? MARGI: None, Baba. 

BABA: And could you even inspire any Margis to become Block 
Secretaries within your district? MARGI: No, Baba. I'm sorry. BABA: 
You're sorry. Are you married? MARGI: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Then why are you also keeping a secret wife? (Some of us 
gasp in surprise. Most surprised is the Margi, who rolls his eyes and is 
no longer able to stand still.) Haram jada! (You donkey!) Because your 
lifestyle is immoral, of course you could not achieve anything. And due 
to your illicit behavior you have also contracted some serious disease. Is 
it not so? 

MARGI: Yes, Baba... 

BABA: Do you promise from this very moment to rectify yourself and 
become an ideal man, serving the society with all of your capacity? 
MARGI: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Come closer. (The Margi moves near Baba, who reaches out and 
momentarily touches him below the navel area.) You are henceforth 
cured of that disease. Do you understand that we, the members of the 
collective society, maintain high expectations regarding the contribution 
that you will make for the universal welfare? 



341 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


MARGI: Yes, 

Baba. BABA: Very 
good. 

When we spoke to him afterward, he refused to tell what disease he 
had, saying only that it was something abominable. Then he went to the 
bathroom. After coming out, he said, "By Baba's grace it is cured!" 

Service beyond party politics 

Today Baba introduced a new program called ARS: All-Round Ser¬ 
vice. Henceforth it will be a daily-report item. ARS consists of basic 
relief works to be offered to the most needy people, and will be directed 
primarily at the communist and post-communist countries. Baba 
explained four points— 

1) ARS had to be created due to the defective economic subsistence 
level in the communist countries. 

2 ) ARS has nothing to do with party politics.. 

3) We have to help the people down to the district level at the time of 
calamity. 

4 ) We should continue cooperation with other service organizations 
such as Red Cross and Oxfam. 

The Fareast Asia sector has the greatest population of any sector 
suffering under communism. It includes China, Asiatic Russia, 
Mongolia, North Korea and Tibet, so this new emphasis will be very 
important for us. 


An article appeared in the newspaper today about a flood in South 
Korea. Baba, to whom at least four newspapers are read daily, requested 
a report within twelve hours about our relief work. I tried to telephone 
our office in Seoul, but could not get through. 

When the deadline for reporting approached, Baba's personal as¬ 
sistant pressed me for the report. I told him that I couldn't get through, 
but he wouldn't accept this reply. Not knowing what to do, I closed my 
eyes, meditated on Baba's face, and asked Him for guidance. I imagined 
what work we should have done in Korea, and accordingly, on opening 
my eyes wrote the following false report: 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


342 


"In the aftermath of Typhoon Judy, Seoul Regional Secretary (Dada 
Alok) and Universal Proutist Intellectual Federation Secretary (Dada 
Mahaprajinananda) organized a relief team of 12 Margis to help home¬ 
less and suffering people in the Seoul area. Already clothes have been 
given to 25 families, and food to 200 people. The team also helped to 
clean out and make habitable four houses so far. They will continue their 
work with accelerating speed." 

Soon after the report was submitted, Baba called a meeting in His 
bedroom. During that meeting, He praised Hong Kong Sector for re¬ 
sponding so quickly to the flood in Korea, and encouraged the repre¬ 
sentatives of other sectors to follow this example. On top of that, He 
directed the Central Public Relations Secretary to submit the news of our 
on-going Korean relief work to the Calcutta newspapers. 

I was thoroughly embarrassed, but could tell nobody. All this 
hoopla over a false report. At the end of the session, I immediately took 
permission to go to the city public telephone office. 

This time I got the line to Seoul. Dada Alok answered: 

ME: Alok, it's absolutely urgent that you do something for the people 
suffering from the flood in Korea. Baba read about it in the newspapers. 

ALOK: We already did a bit of relief work. 

ME: Great! I'm writing it down. Tell me who did the work? 

ALOK: About a dozen Margis under the guidance of Mahaprajina- 
nandaji and myself. 

ME: Wow! I was just guessing Mahaprajinanandaji was there. 

ALOK: What? 

ME: Nothing. How many people did you help? 

ALOK: We gave clothes to about twenty-five families, and food to 
about 200 people. 

ME: That's incredible! Absolutely totally Baba Nam Kevalam! Did 
you, by the way, did you clean out any houses? 

ALOK: Yeah. 

ME: Was it about four houses? 

ALOK: No, it was three houses. Wait a moment, come to think of it, it 
was four houses. How did you know? 

ME: I love you, Baba! Somehow Baba knew all this even without the 
telephone call. He's reporting your work to the newspapers already. 



343 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


ALOK: What're you talking about? Really? But it's not such a big deal 
yet. Anyway you can let Him know that there's a lot of people still 
suffering, so we'll do more and more work. 

ME: I already told Him you'll work with accelerating speed. 

ALOK: Exactly. 

ME: We should give some more news to the papers. So try to call me 
with your report tomorrow and the day after also. ALOK: Will do. 

The peculiar business of making saints 

All the other workers were doing meditation, and I alone guessed that 
Baba's door was wide open. I stood there for half an hour, look-ing at Him 
as He talked with Dada Keshavananda. Baba was in a fine mood, laughing 
and joking. Toward the end, Keshavanandaji gave Him a soft drink. Like a 
child, Baba wore a napkin tucked in at His neck, and sipped repeatedly at 
the plastic straw, enjoying Himself. I felt a change in the air, and knew 
something was coming, though they still talked lightly together. Suddenly, 
Baba began shouting loudly, and Keshavanandaji jumped up and ran out of 
the room, calling the Central workers. Baba, alone now, continued shouting. 
Within seconds, they all clambered into His room. Boiling with rage, He 
charged them with numerous crimes. They could hardly reply. Within no 
time, pun- ishment was allocated, and all these senior workers rolled onto 
their backs and into the shoulder stand, their legs pointed up in the air. 
Some of them are old gray haired men. 

As soon as they were so positioned, Baba returned to His drink, as if 
nothing had happened. He spoke mildly with Keshavanandaji, and paid 
absolutely no attention to the score of workers so oddly assembled 
before Him. 

The workers smiled at each other, whispered together, and, knowing 
it would be a long session, secretly leaned their legs against the walls. 

Tears in our eyes 

Today was the last day of this month's reporting so all the secto-trial 
representatives were holding garlands, hoping to get a chance to place them 
on Baba. During these last months He had not directly received any 
garlands, but rather accepted them only through His personal assistant. 

Still, we had hope. 



Working 24 Hours a Day 


344 


After He returned from field walk, we quickly lined up at the side 
door. There are two entrances to the main reporting room: the front 
door, and the side door which Baba uses as He walks upstairs to His 
room. He would not enter the reporting room at this late time. Since 
Fareast Asia — Hong Kong Sector — is always the first to be called, I 
stood at the front of the line. For some minutes He talked to us. Then He 
turned to go upstairs. We would not be able to put our garlands on 
Him... 

Then abruptly He pivoted, and walked into the reporting room. 
Within a moment He was seated, and I heard Keshavanandaji yell, 
"Hong Kong Sector!" 

The narrow path back around the house to the front was blocked by 
twenty-six workers: two Dadas and one Didi from each of the nine 
sectors. I could not push them aside, but neither could I delay when I 
was being called before Baba. So I jumped. I wonder how I did it, and 
still people ask me about it, but I jumped over this entire crowd of 
workers, and in no time ran through the front door and up to Baba. 
Keshavanandaji smiled broadly and tilted his head, also marveling at 
how I came so fast. 

Without waiting for permission, I placed my garland over Baba's 
head, and draped it on His neck. His eyes glittered. All my excitement 
disappeared as I became lost in His affection. 

"Did you enjoy the program, Dharmavedananda?" 

"Too much, Baba." 

"But do you remember our days together in Berlin Sector?" 

His tone made me start crying. "Just like... it was yesterday... Baba." 

He smiled at me, and kept His eyes on me, though He said nothing. 
His eyes also teared. After some time the magic shifted, and He did 
namaskar to me, tears still shining in our eyes. 

From that moment my state of mind was so altered that I cannot 
remember anything else that happened. 

Y ou will see 

Dada Mantreshvarananda told me that on a recent field walk he had 
the following conversation with Baba: 

DADA: Baba, today the materialists have all the power. They have all 
the manpower, all the wealth, all the technological strength. The 



Travels with the 
Mystic Master 

spiritual-moralists, on the other hand, are but few in number, having no 
wealth, and almost no machinery. Excuse me for asking, Baba, but in 
the face of this reality, how can we expect to see the realization of a 
Proutist government within any reasonable period of time? 

BABA (abruptly turning toward Mantreshvaranandaji): There is no 
one who can stop Prout's progress. It will be established within a very 
short time. (Pointing His finger at Dada) You will see. 

Improving bodies for improved service 

During reporting of Dadas, in the midst of the review of one worker, 
Baba suddenly interrupted him: 

BABA: There is a dull pain in the lower vertebrae of your spine. Is it 
not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Occasionally it flares into acute pain. Is it not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Have you not experienced these symptoms for several years? 
DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA (looking at the General Secretary): GS Da, place your right thumb 
in my palm. (The General Secretary does so, and Baba rubs his thumb 
between His two hands.) What is the feeling in your thumb now? 
GENERAL SECRETARY: It is very hot, Baba. 

BABA: Using that hot thumb, touch the vertebrae in the area of his 
svadhistana chakra (i.e., area of lower back). (Speaking to first Dada:) 

Is that the area of your pain? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: GS, twist and turn your hot thumb ... move slightly higher ... 
yes... now move down the spine ... continue ... yes ... that is enough. 

Now, how do you feel, my boy? 

DADA: I feel full of power. 

BABA: And the pain? 

DADA: It is gone, Baba. 

BABA: It will not return. Now, what plan have you chalked out for 
the use of your improved body? 

DADA: I will do maximum service to the suffering humanity, Baba. 
BABA: Very good. Very good.

Pretending to be normal 

Baba's voice is a nasal one. It is something peculiar. Many people 
like that voice, but I doubt that the public would consider His voice 
especially appealing or magnificent. 

That's why, after hearing Baba's voice for more than ten years, today 
I was surprised. His voice became beautiful and mellow, like a trained 
public speaker. The scene was appropriate for this attractive voice, 
because He spoke to the Prout candidates for state assemblies in India. 

It was as if He wanted to give them an example how to speak to the 
public though He did not say it in so many words. 

A portion of His speech in English: 

"Communism was a Utopian idea never to be materialized on this 
earth. Now most of the countries have recognized this fact. So this is the 
opportune moment for Prout to come. We have to propagate it among 
the intellectuals. The time is come. In each and every corner of the 
earth. In each and every hearth of human soul. For this we need more 
Prout cadres. Forty-eight new wholetimers in India, and forty-eight new 
wholetimers overseas. Help this project. It is not enough, but for the 
time being it may do something. I said twice before, the time is come. 
There is no other philosophy to solve the world's problems and quench 
human thirst. This election proved there is a need and a demand. The 
world wants you. No time is to be lost. There is dire necessity." 

Perhaps each and every action of Baba is calculated for its effect. He 
is a full-time unpaid actor. To imagine that all these years He was 
speaking in an artificial voice. And why did He pick such a nasal sound? 

I can guess that He wanted us to be attracted only by His way of living, 
His ideas, and His sacrifice. 

Perhaps this is why He wears glasses, dresses simply, and appears 
normal. In the early days, before Ananda Marga was well known, it often 
happened in train stations that non-Margis would approach Dadas to 
pay their respects, never even noticing Baba. 

I remember a story from many years ago: 

A certain Margi believed that Baba did not need spectacles, but only 
wore them because His unobstructed gaze was too over-powering. One 
day, this Margi served Baba His meal. When he entered the room, 



THE 


Travels with 
Mystic Master 

he saw Baba reading a newspaper without wearing His glasses. But He 
was holding the paper very close to His eyes. 

The shocked Margi thought, My God! Baba does need glasses! He 
stood there, holding the tray of food, unable to move. Wild thoughts 
entered his mind: perhaps he had over-estimated Baba; perhaps Baba 
was not really powerful; perhaps He was not a true guru. 

After thinking this for some time, he noticed that Baba was holding 
the newspaper upside-down. 

In that moment, Baba lowered the paper, looked at the Margi, and 
smiled. 

Going to Ananda Nagar instead of staying with Baba 

Everyone is alarmed. Baba has experienced some sort of heart fail¬ 
ure, and was admitted to the emergency ward of a private nursing home. 
The festive atmosphere of yesterday is now replaced by a gloomy one. 

Next day. Workers and Margis have decided to hold continuous 
kiirtan until Baba is cured. The kiirtan has been super-high. Now again 
everyone is feeling inspired. 

Next day. Just after the kiirtan reached the 24-hour mark, Baba sent 
a message from the nursing home: "All Margis and workers should 
proceed to Ananda Nagar for the winter program. May it be a grand 
success. Keep in mind three points: 1) All Margis should love Ananda 
Nagar. If any don't yet love Ananda Nagar, they should start to love it 
now. 2) Ananda Nagar is the best place for Margis. 3) Every Margi's 
body should touch the soil of Ananda Nagar." 

Though Baba remained away, we had to follow His directives. We 
stopped the kiirtan, and left for Ananda Nagar. 


Five days later. Ananda Nagar. As Baba foretold, our spiritual fes¬ 
tival was "a grand success." About 30,000 Margis attended. Sixty-five 
full-timers and Margis decided to go for acharya training, and twenty 
pieces of land were donated for making model communities.

CHAPTER 20 


H e Sends Out a Clarion Call 

L ittle work and all pleasure 

Calcutta, January 1990. Today, as Baba was leaving the nursing 
home, He called all the nurses "Ma" and distributed sweets to them. 
They all cried. The last person at the door was Baba's doctor, Dr Sen, 
one of India's leading heart specialists. He also treated Mother Teresa. 
He said, "Baba, we all thank You for putting Your holy feet in our 
nursing home. But You are not a man, or even a superman. You are a 
god." Then he prostrated himself at Baba's feet. 

Dada Keshavananda told me that a few days ago the doctors pro¬ 
tested that Baba was continuing to compose Prabhat Sangiit songs in 
the emergency ward even though they had requested Him not to do any 
work. In one day alone He wrote thirteen songs. He responded by 
saying, "Composing Prabhat Sangi it does not require any special effort 
from my part. Similarly, whenever I write Shabda Cayanika (His 
encyclopedia), it is a spontaneous expression. Rather than considering 
these processes to be my work, you should title them my pleasures." 

Keshavanandaji asked Baba what He considered to be work. He said, 
"When I conceptualized the idea of Ananda Marga, or Prout, or 
microvita, or Neo-H uman ism —these original revolutionary creations 
required a little exertion. You may be interested to know that the work 
which occupied my effort for the longest time was the invention of our 
Pratik (the symbol of Ananda Marga). It took me thirty minutes." 

A few days ago two nurses approached Keshavanandaji with a ques¬ 
tion. They said, "Each of us separately observed Baba talking in His 



349 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


sleep. Both times He said the same words: Master units. Master units. 
Do the words master units have any special meaning that you know?" 

Keshavanandaji laughed. "Yes, I know. The establishment of Master 
Units all over the globe is now our most important program. It is so 
important that Baba goes on creating the conducive psychic wave for 
them even when His body is sleeping." 99 

The last story concerns Dr Ramesh, a specialist at the clinic. One day 
the doctor told Baba, "Your health is not good. But I understand you 
frequently scold your workers. Anger is not helpful to your cure. So I 
request you to refrain from such rebuking." 

Baba became furious, shouting loud enough to cause everyone to 
jump, "Who is he to tell me such a thing!" 

The Dadas became upset, and the doctors became afraid. 

In a twinkle of an eye, Baba again changed His mood, and said 
sweetly, "Now, do you mean like that?" 

"Yes, Baba," said Dr Ramesh, shaking. 

"No need to worry," said Baba. "You see, I say all such caustic words 
from my throat, not from my heart. It does not affect me." 


"TheM aster Unit program is the culmination of all other social service activities of Ananda 
M arga. For simplicity's sake, until this point my diary entries referred to such projects as' 1 land 
communities" or 11 model communities." Ananda Nagar was our first M aster Unit. To be 
considered a M aster Unit, a piece of land must beat least five acres. On this land we must 
establish a yoga/meditation center, agricultural farm, cottage industry, family dwellings, a self- 
contained system of ponds and streams, an alternative energy center, and a permanent service 
center. According to location and various other factors, we should also, if possible, develop a 
children'shomeand school, a wild animal sanctuary, botanical gardens, medical hospital or 
clinic, a dairy farm, and a good number of welfare homes and appropriate industries. Thus, the 
M aster Unit serves as a model community by which the public may practically experience Prout 
in action. Without this demonstration, Prout would be only an interesting theory, and most 
people would not believe that the implementation of Prout is truly possible. The M aster Unit is 
also a training ground to develop the subtle feelings and knowledge required for gaining the 
cooperation and leadership skills upon which a Proutist society is based. 

Though Baba gave the concept of M aster Unit many years before this diary entry, it was only in 
1987 that He began emphasizing it. During the four years beginning with 1987, He gradually 
stepped up the level of concentration on making and developing M aster Units. Eventually, 
almost every Dada and Didi became involved in obtaining land. Throughout the world we now 
own hundreds of properties on which we are developing M aster Unit projects. For example, in 
theFareast Asia sector we have a total of ten M aster Units in Taiwan, K orea, Russia, M ongolia, 
Hong K ong and J apan.

The creator of madness 

The doctors first gave strict instructions, and then pleaded with Baba, 
that He should not work for the next one month. Though it is doubtful 
He can keep Himself away from work for so long, we expect that for a 
few days at least He will abide by these instructions. He will not, for 
example, hold darshan or workers' meetings. Many Margis are here from 
all over the world who are desperate for a glimpse of Baba. Their only 
chance is while Baba takes garden-walks twice daily. It is possible to look 
over the boundary wall and see Him. It is Baba's private time so no one is 
technically permitted to do this, but the rule is generally overlooked 
because the Margis have never been too many at a single time, and 
everyone maintains silence. This stretching of the .rule has gone on for 
years. 

Today there were far more Margis looking over the wall than at any 
other time. There were hundreds, mostly from overseas. The Margis 
literally climbed over each other to secure a vantage points on the wall. 
To see over the wall it is necessary to stand on something, usually piled 
bricks or rocks. The types of structures thus built were varied, and often 
were piled too high, so that they sometimes collapsed, causing many 
people to simultaneously fall to the ground. Though knees and elbows 
were scraped, no one seemed to care. 

In this atmosphere, for the first time, the unwritten rule of main¬ 
taining silence was broken. The Margis could not control themselves. As 
Baba emerged in a wheelchair, a few weeping sounds and sighs cut the 
silence. Within a few more moments, such a thrill swept through the 
crowd that Margis were crying, laughing, yelling "Baba!," "Namaskar 
Baba!" and so on. Baba smiled. He turned His face toward the Margis, 
and they went wild. A Yugoslavian brother jumped over the wall, and 
was immediately restrained by the security volunteers. I was standing or, 
rather, hanging down from the roof, and had a perfect view of the whole 
scene. It was cinematic, to say the least. 

As Baba concluded the walk, He was wheeled toward the final corner. 
It was a few meters from there that the Yugoslavian brother was being 
held. Suddenly he broke away from the guards, lunged in front of Baba, 
and prostrated at His feet. In the same moment, Baba's closest 
bodyguard, Pratap, leapt forward, and in a single flowing movement 
lifted the brother off the ground and thrust him into the distance. 

Though 



351 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


everyone was excited by this performance, Baba was undisturbed. He 
pretended not even to see it, though it happened immediately before 
Him. 

A moment later, when yet another Margi yelled "Namaskar Baba," 
He spoke to the Margis for the one and only time, saying, "You are all 
doing namaskar to me. One namaskar from me is enough for all." He 
then folded His hands and, turning His body slowly around, did a long 
namaskar toward all the Margis. The effect was like His varabhaya 
mudra, His gesture of blessing during DMC. By their crying and sighing 
it was clear that every Margi felt it. 

Don't make problems out of nothing 

Without reporting sessions to attend, I've time on my hands. Think¬ 
ing to inspire a few Margis from my sector, I escorted four of them to 
the Didis' quarters where I requested a meeting with Didi Ananda 
Bharati who everyone affectionately calls Aunty. Aunty is the first Didi 
and also the oldest. She is the sole teacher of kapalika meditation for 
Didis who are authorized by Baba to become avadhutikas. For many 
months she has been so sick that she could hardly leave her room. 

The five of us sat around her bed. 

"How are you, Aunty?" I asked. 

"My T is fine. But, ach, this body should have died some years ago. 
Baba is just keeping it around for His pleasure. Ha, ha!" 

She spoke in such a way that we all laughed with her. Then I asked 
Aunty to tell us some of her experiences with Baba. She did not want to 
tell any, but due to our repeated requests, she narrated a few incidents. 
These stories were mostly sentimental. For example, she said, "I used to 
frequent His kitchen to cook food for Him. Once I made ice cream for 
Him, and He said, 'Mother, this is yum yum!' 

"I remember this sort of moment best. You know, He never had me 
sit on the floor like other workers—He always arranged a chair for me. 
Though I was the disciple, He was such a gentleman with me. 

"Countless times I saw Him perform miracles with other workers and 
Margis. But I never desired that experience. I don't crave things which 
come and go. I only want what's permanent. So He never gave me those 
kinds of miracles. Yet I know He hears the words I am speaking right 
now. No one can hide anything from Baba. 

"You must listen to Guru like a child listens to his teacher in school. 
Though Baba is against dogma, we must have blind faith in Him. This

352 


alone is surrender. The more the child surrenders, the more He must 
take care." 

She turned to each of the Margis to ask them how they felt in India—it 
was the first visit for each of them. When it came to Taiwan sister 
Madhavi's turn, she said, "I'm fine, Aunty." Knowing that Madhavi was 
actually sick, I said, "You see, Aunty, Madhavi is Chinese. So even if she 
has problems, she will say she has no problems." 

Aunty said, "Why should she have problems? She is a yogini, a 
Tantric." 

"But the more we Tantrics evolve, Aunty," I said, "the more prob¬ 
lems we have." 

"No, no," she said. "No problems." 

"But look at Baba," I said. "He has so many problems." 

"Oh, Baba. He is something different. Listen, don't make problems 
where there need be no problems." 

She gazed at me, smiling. Her last sentence, simple and obvious as it 
was, rang in my mind. For the first time in my life I realized that I had a 
tendency to dig up problems and complications even when they were 
best left undisturbed. I will never forget her words . 100 

Global water crisis 

Ananda Nagar. June. During a workers' meeting, Baba said, "A water 
crisis is soon to strike the earth. Due to overuse of underground water 
resources, the water-table is sinking. Furthermore, at some point that 
water will become so polluted it can no longer be processed for drinking. 
This problem will dominate over most other problems in most countries 
of the world. It will be the direct cause of millions of deaths. In many 
areas people will become dependent on rainwater. International 
commerce in water will become more than commerce in petroleum. This 
crisis will come to a peak in the year 2000. Will you remember that? 
2000? (So saying, Baba used His forefinger to draw the numerals 2-0-0- 
o in the air.) It is for this reason that on our Master Units, next to every 
building, a pond should be constructed to catch the rainwater. Our 
Master Units should not depend on underground water sources." 


100 A few weeks later Aunty died. 



353 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


The most powerful mudra I ever felt 

Baba's DMC varabhaya mudra (gesture of blessing) was scheduled 
for today. In the moment that we all expected Him to give the mudra, 
however, He brought His hands down on the couch—so forcefully that it 
made a dull noise. 

There are all sorts of speculative explanations. But no one really 
understands Baba's strange behavior. 

The crowd of about 30,000 was disappointed. 

Two days later. There was no darshan this morning; the program 
was clearly finished, and most people arranged to leave. We faced the 
usual problems of secretly removing the overseas Margis. The police 
want to catch foreign Margis and blacklist them from reentering India. 
In the past, we hid them inside large trucks. But this time the trucks 
were delayed, and hadn't come. 

Two or three workers made a plan to hustle the overseas Margis into 
a train during its stop in Pundag (the closest station). This plan was 
neither announced nor clarified, even when it came time to rush the first 
batch of Margis to the train. At that time, about two or three thousand 
Indian Margis were also boarding. 

The police spotted the non-Indians, and took up the chase. While 
most of the foreigners escaped, they succeeded in capturing three sisters 
and one brother. In the process, they ripped off some of the women's 
clothing in a most disrespectful manner. In India such behavior toward 
women is considered outrageous. Within moments the Margis were 
taken off to the nearby policebox. 

The Indian Margis were so angry about the behavior of the police 
that they pulled out one of the track railings, rendering the train im¬ 
mobile. The Margis declared they would not permit the train to leave 
until the captured Margis were released. 

The few hundred innocent passengers already on the train became 
the victims of this drama. Two Margis gave them a mass lecture to 
explain the problem, and all became sympathetic. The Margis brought 
water and snacks for the stranded passengers. 

Meanwhile, back at Ananda Nagar (about two kilometers away), all 
the overseas workers had long before changed from their orange 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


354 


robes to civilian clothes. Hearing that the police and local communist 
thugs were preparing for a confrontation, we engaged ourselves in plan¬ 
ning and constructing a defense. We began shifting the women and 
children into more central buildings where they would be safer. In this 
way, several hours passed. The tension increased, and still the train 
remained. Because it was a fasting day, the strain was not only psychic 
but also physical. 

At 10:00 p.m., someone yelled, "I see Baba's car! It's headed toward 
the darshan tent!" Since the DMC program seemed finished, and as we 
were in the midst of a dangerous crisis, we could not believe that Baba 
would give darshan. But better run to the tent to see! 

By the time I entered, Baba was already seated, and a program was 
indeed underway. For the first time ever, I sat in the middle instead of 
the front for darshan. Being in civil clothes, I preferred not to attract the 
attention of anyone, including Baba. 

Because many people had already left, and the tent was half empty, 
the feeling was strange. But Baba was in a fine mood, joking and speak¬ 
ing casually. When He finally started the formal darshan itself, the air 
became energized. By the time He had half finished, I was so concen¬ 
trated on Him that I unconsciously shifted from my normal cross-legged 
position to a strained kneeling pose. Even though He spoke in Bengali, I 
became excited. I didn't know why. And then I thought, "Perhaps He'll 
give the mudra. How odd if it's so, but..." A few moments later He began 
singing the chant Samgacchadvam, which always precedes the mudra. 
We all sat forward, astounded, waiting, tense. 

And He gave it. A varabhaya mudra as I had never before experi¬ 
enced. He used to hold the mudra for perhaps five seconds or less. But 
this one, how long did it last? At the time it seemed interminable. 
Everyone, absolutely everyone, including the small children, were 
blasted. Shouts of "Baba! Baba!" came from all sides. I also shouted 
uncontrollably. My hair seemed to stand on end. My eyes felt as if they 
would pop out of their sockets, and my skin as if it would explode off my 
body. My heart burst with feeling for Him, and my mind stopped 
functioning, except to think Baba! Baba! 

At last He closed His hands, and did namaskar. Perhaps forty sec¬ 
onds had passed. The crowd sang Prabhat Sang!it or something, I don't 
remember—I remained absorbed in looking at Him. Then everyone 



355 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


stood up to dance kiirtan. I stood but could not dance. I could only stare 
at Him. As the kiirtan continued, Baba slowly walked off the stage. 

Without thinking, I ran toward Him. The tent was so big. I did not 
know where He had gone, but I lifted up one wall, dove under, and kept 
running. Sooner than I expected, I saw Baba entering His car. Volunteer 
guards were protecting the area with their sticks. Paying no attention to 
them, I rushed toward Baba. The guards didn't react quickly enough, 
and I was soon past them. I rushed up to the window of Baba's car 
without any concern for the impropriety of my clothing. I was crying. 

The car drove away before I could touch it. I ran alongside it. I could 
clearly see Baba, though He did not see me. Weeping and running. Oh, 
Baba! It went on a long way like that. Then the car sped up, leaving me 
behind. 

I walked slowly toward our quarters. Someone came from behind me 
and took my hand—Dada Nityashubhananda. He was also deeply 
affected. We walked together without speaking, tears welling in our eyes. 
When we arrived at the hostel, I excused myself and went up to the roof 
to be alone in the darkness. Everyone else was still at the darshan tent. 
As I sat for meditation, I heard powerful, booming voices speaking to 
the crowd over the PA system. 

The mudra had invested everyone with such energy that an imme¬ 
diate return to normality was impossible. Remembering the stand-off at 
the train station, the Margis became even more excited. They could no 
longer tolerate the injustice. Hundreds poured out of the tent and raced 
toward the station. 

Silence returned. I slipped deep into meditation and paid no heed to my 
surroundings. I was unaware when the overseas Margis returned to the 
hostel. Unaware when, some time later, a great hubbub stirred. 

Someone ran onto the roof. "Dada, we've been looking for you! Come 
quickly, there's an emergency!" 

Uninterested, but compelled by duty (I have been the main organizer 
for overseas Margis during this DMC), I rose slowly to my feet and made 
my way downstairs. Three or four workers rushed up to me. 
"Dharmavedananda, where've you been? There's been an attack!" 

My senses returned. "Where? What happened exactly?" 

"The police went mad at the station area! They fired their rifles ran¬ 
domly in all directions! Many people were hit, and some may be dead!" 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


356 


I looked at my watch. After midnight. Margis and workers were 
running here and there. A Dada told me that he was going to the hos¬ 
pital by motorcycle to check on the extent of the injuries and asked me if 
I wanted to come. I nodded. Within minutes we were there. 

About twenty men were lying in beds, groaning from bullet shots. 
One in particular was screaming in pain. Not long after, he died. The 
condition of four others was critical. 

The police had fired indiscriminately. Though many women and 
children were in the crowd, none were hit. It seemed that only divine 
dispensation had spared them. 

The suffering was very real. For some reason I was inspired. Their 
stolid manner in the face of agony, the history in the making of which all 
were aware, and the fact that Baba chose this moment to give His 
mudra—l felt, I had to feel, that a noble purpose was behind us. I held 
someone's hand here, touched a forehead there—what more could I do? 
The doctors and nurses were caring for them, and I had still to think for 
the overseas Margis. 

We went back to constructing more defenses, still discussing how to 
escape, taking care of some Margis who were inexperienced, helping 
others to adjust who were physically ill—it was late, 3:30 a.m.; we had 
been fasting in the heat all day; Margis were collapsing, closing their 
eyes, sleeping. It was enough already. I informed the guards that I, too, 
would rest until the sun rose, and to wake me if there was news. 

Dramatic education 

At sunrise, I awoke. A few workers were talking. 

"Has anyone spoken to Baba about all this?" I asked. 

"Just now one Dada came with that news. Baba said, 'I'm very 
pained by the suffering of these boys. But why did no one check with me 
before rushing in front of the police? It was inappropriate.'" 

Soon after, the trucks finally arrived. We prepared to leave in our 
normal secret manner. 

And what about the four imprisoned overseas Margis? After hearing 
Baba's comment, we decided to deal with their cases through the courts. 



357 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Ranchi. The evening papers ran headlines stories about the attack. 
Photos of the dead Dada and the four severely injured workers appeared 
with long articles condemning the behavior of the police. 

Though this conflict may have technically been inappropriate, I feel 
it was a part of the Cosmic plan. The Margis now understand better the 
injustice of this government and the general public has gained further 
evidence of the persecution of Ananda Marga. We have experienced and 
learned many things through this incident. 

Maybe I have no right to make the following comment. Nevertheless: 
Though Baba's words condemned the Margis' action, I feel He knew it 
would happen, and perhaps on the psychic level caused it to happen. It 
was obvious that Baba should have been consulted first; I think He 
speeded up their minds and made them forget to ask Him. In order to 
create various circumstances for our growth, the Tantra guru often 
causes us to commit mistakes, without which the necessary conditions 
would never develop. 

Some people may consider my opinion a heartless one. For me, 
however, this idea is full of love. I remember Baba's explanation as to 
why Krishna engineered the Mahabharata war: "It was meant for popu¬ 
lar education. If Parama Purusha (Cosmic Consciousness) accom¬ 
plishes everything by mere thought-projection, the lessons would go 
unnoticed and unlearnt by others....Hence, events like the battle of 
Kurukshetra had to be conceived and dramatized....Nobody was 
spared— even Abhimanyu, the nephew of Krishna and son of Aijuna, 
was not spared. For in war between virtue and vice, the sparks of the fire 
spread out on all sides." 101 

Conversation on a train 

New Delhi. While coming here by train, I overheard an interesting 
conversation. Several educated men were discussing world politics. They 
spoke in English. When their conversation turned to the predicament of 
communism, one of them said, "The strange fact is that many years ago 
the guru of Ananda Marga, P.R. Sarkar, predicted in detail the collapse 
of communism." 

Another man made a few comments about Baba, and finished by 
saying, "Yes, in every age at least one such great intellectual is there."

"But he also prophesied the demise of capitalism," said a third. "I 
don't know about that." 

"Well, none of us knew about communism's downfall either. Let's wait 
and see. If I had to wager, I'd bet whatever Sarkar said is correct." 

They all nodded their heads. I was about to stick my neck out and say 
something, when they changed the topic. 

The university 

Tokyo. A Dada returned from India today. The latest news is that 
Baba has started a new program. A university is being created in Ananda 
Nagar. 

Several times daily, jeeps and motorcycles arrive at the Central Of¬ 
fice piled high with books to be used for the university library. The books 
are perused by a full-time staff of workers and Margis. One of the largest 
rooms in the office is being used for planning the university's 
architecture, courses, staff needs, budgets and so on. They are hoping to 
open the university before the end of the year, and so, an enormous 
amount of preparation is required. 102 

Amnesty cooperates 

A few days ago, while teaching meditation at Waseda University, I 
met a few student members of Amnesty International. On their initia¬ 
tive, I was introduced to a local Amnesty leader who spoke fluent En¬ 
glish. I explained that Ananda Nagar workers are facing almost daily 
attacks from thugs and police. I also explained that Amnesty never 
helped us when Baba was in jail, because His case was then classified as 
a criminal case. She was sympathetic and requested me to show her 
proof of my allegations. Since then, we have had several meetings, and I 
have presented all the newspaper clippings, court decisions and other 
documents related to the persecution of Ananda Marga in Bengal. Today 
the Tokyo Amnesty office formally took up our case and began 
correspondence with their London headquarters. The woman in-charge 
told me they would insist on a proper investigation, though it may take a 
few weeks to get the ball rolling. 


102 T ogether with theM aster Unit program, the university is one of our most important 
Central projects. It isconcerned not only with academic study but also with practical research 
on new scientific inventions and agricultural systemsat Ananda Nagar.

TotaI shock 

October 22. The most shocking experience of my life occurred today. 

At 3:00 in the morning, Dada Artapremananda woke me up and 
called me into his office where he had been sleeping alone. His eyes 
bulged, his body shivered continuously, and his skin was pale. He looked 
as if he had gone mad. 

"I... received ... a phone call two hours ago," he stammered. "I 
couldn't believe it, and just sat here dazed since then. But... but... now 
another call came. So I had to tell someone." 

"What is it?" I said. 

He started weeping and shaking furiously. I put my hand on his 
shoulder to try to comfort him. "Baba ... is ... gone." 

"What! What are you talking about?" I said. 

His crying and shaking increased. 

"Did you have a bad dream or something?" 

"No. No. Oh, Baba. First Didi Hemavati called me from Korea. Now 
someone called from Calcutta. It's true. Baba's left His body." 

"It's impossible! I can't believe it, and I don't accept it." 

"Oh, I don't know what to do or what to think," he said. 

"No, this is ridiculous. Baba couldn't have died. He said He would 
stay until His work was done. It must be something else. I am going to 
call Calcutta." 

"Alright." 

After a few minutes I was able to get through. Dada Bhaveshananda 
answered. 

"What happened?" I said. 

His voice was sober, slow and somewhat shaking, "It seems... Baba 
left." 

"What do you mean seems?" 

"The life force is gone for some hours now. No pulse. Nothing." 
"Perhaps He's in samadhi or some special state. Maybe He will come out 
of it after some time." 

"Well, we hope so. But... I don't think so." 

I tried to think of something else to say, but my mind went blank. I 
passed the phone to Artapremanandaji, and he spoke briefly in Hindi. 
Then he hung up. He turned to me, saying, "What should we do?" 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


360 


"Well, I simply don't believe Baba's died," I said, almost calmly. "But 
in any case, something extraordinary's happened, so I want to go to 
India immediately." 

"Yes, I'll also go." 

"Now we should tell the other Dadas." 

"Oh, I can't talk anymore." "It's okay. I'll 

tell them." 

I woke up the others and brought them in the room. I felt very cold, 
but otherwise almost normal. After speaking a few words of introduc¬ 
tion to prepare their minds, I said, "They're all telling that Baba has 
died." 

No one said a word. But all four of them stared at me eerily. Their 
faces all wore strange expressions, and they edged closer toward me. 
"There's no explanation," I said. "And personally, I just don't believe it." 

They could hardly speak. I don't know why, but I think they imme¬ 
diately accepted it as true. Without saying a word, Moksanandaji got up, 
took his jacket, and walked out of the house. The others wandered 
aimlessly or sat and stared at the walls. 

I was sure there was more to the story. Unworried, I took a shower, 
entered the meditation room, and sang kiirtan as if it were an ordinary 
day. No one joined me. 

At 9:001 phoned our travel agent and booked tickets for Artapre- 
manandaji and myself. By 10:00 we were out the door and on our way to 
the airport. 

Sitting in the plane, I was still feeling relatively normal when 
Artapremanandaji turned to me and said, "I just remembered some¬ 
thing Bhaveshananda told me which I didn't tell you. They've already 
put Baba's body on the ice." 

His words hit me like a sledgehammer. "What? But then ... He must 
really be ... Oh, God, no! Oh, no! Then He's really dead!" 

I turned my face away. At this point I can't clearly remember what 
happened, except that I went mad. A million ideas and visions passed 
through me. I thought of every possibility of what it meant for Baba and 
for me. I wept at my loss, wept at the world's loss, worried for Baba, 
blamed Him, felt as lonely as a boat lost at sea, burned in my physical 
heart, felt guilty, felt rejected, felt insane. I even thought of leaving 



361 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


Ananda Marga. Why should I stay without Baba? Our mission was not 
yet finished, and we would never be able to complete it without Him. 

After about an hour, I regained my composure. It was just a test. He 
knew what He was doing, as He had always known. There must be a 
great purpose behind it. Though I never imagined He would do such a 
thing, I had to accept it. Though it was intolerable, I had to tolerate it. I 
would have to go ahead, and I steeled my mind for the task. I forced it to 
be positive, if not happy. 

Throughout this time I hadn't spoken to Artapremanandaji. At this 
point I turned toward him, saying, "I'm okay now." He nodded his head. 

When we reached Bangkok, we called Japan. Only a few minutes 
before, Moksanandaji had returned. After receiving the news, he had 
strayed through the streets of Tokyo for fifteen hours. 

H e remains active without H is physical body 

Yesterday I received an emergency visa from the Indian embassy in 
Thailand. After discussing the matter with a few workers, it was decided 
that all Didis and Dadas could come. We phoned Japan, Taiwan, Korea 
and Hong Kong. 

Today at 2:00 a.m., while standing in the line for the immigration 
check in Delhi, I befriended a Japanese tourist and translated all the 
procedures for him. 

Just after receiving my entry stamp, an elderly official in civil clothes 
directed me to the side of the room. 

"You've come for the funeral, haven't you?" he said. 

"What funeral?" 

"You know very well. The Anand Marg funeral." "I'm sorry, I don't know 
what you're talking about." "Listen. I'm an old man. I've seen you in 
Calcutta. I know you're a Margi." 

"Sir, I've never been to Calcutta." 

"I don't want to disturb your program. If you admit the truth to me, I 
will allow you to go ahead for the funeral. Why should I trouble you at a 
moment like this? But if you persist in this drama, I will have you 
deported. Now, please confirm that you are an Anand Margi." 

"A what? Look, it's very late. I'm tired, and I don't know what you're 
talking about."

362 


He turned toward another official and directed the Japanese man to 
be pulled out of the line, suspecting him also to be a Margi. I would have 
laughed internally, but I wasn't in great humor. For God's sake, I was 
enough troubled, and now on top of it, I was going to get deported. 
Surely they would find out the truth because my suitcase contained my 
orange uniform, and Ananda Marga books and documents. I had never 
before been stopped like this, except in Calcutta, so I hadn't taken any 
precautions. 

He asked questions for another half hour. I desperately clung to my 
story that I didn't know Ananda Marga, and was following nobody and 
nothing except my own nose. He didn't believe a single word. Mean¬ 
while, the Japanese fellow was questioned by someone else. 

At last the old man turned to an assistant, saying, "Go check his 
luggage for any Anand Marg related items." 

As I hopelessly handed over the luggage key, I thought, Baba, if You 
get me out of this one, then I'll accept You're still active, even without 
Your physical body. 

About ten minutes later, the assistant returned. He shook his head. 

"I can't believe it," said the officer in Hindi. "Are you sure there's 
nothing?" 

"Nothing," said the assistant, shrugging his shoulders. 

The officer scowled. He stared into my eyes. I looked back 
nonchalantly, hardly believing my luck. "I'm sure you're a Margi," he 
said. "But... you're free to go now." 

"Thanks a lot," I grunted. Then I thought, Baba, You're still with me! 
How did You manage it? 

1 picked up my luggage, and walked to the green channel. 

"Do you have anything to declare?" asked a custom's official. 

"Only a small cheap camera," I said. 

"Show it to me," he said. 

Opening my suitcase, I shuffled my orange clothes and other pos¬ 
sessions around. The camera wasn't there, and neither was a box of 
empty cassette tapes. So that was it! The assistant knew I'd never expose 
his theft. 

"Sorry," I said. "Forgot I left it in Thailand." 

As the official waved me through, I looked back and saw the poor 
Japanese man sweating under the old man's investigation.

Losing my center 

Calcutta. Thousands of Margis are here, eyes glazed or filled with 

tears. 

Because I had already adjusted myself during the plane flight with 
Artapremanandaji, I felt calm. I stood in a long line waiting to enter 
Baba's house to see His body. Next to me stood Cintamani, a Margi from 
Norway. He was particularly lucky, even inspired. After not going to 
India for about ten years, something had pushed him to come here one 
month ago. He was blessed to experience Baba in the last weeks of His 
life. 

We were calmly talking together when suddenly, unexpectandy, a 
surge of feeling rose from my chest, and before I knew what I was doing, 
I was sobbing. As my knees gave way, Cintamani held me up. 

"It's okay, Dadaji, it's okay," he said. 

Now I'd lost my center. Nothing could console me. I dragged myself 
toward the house, crying continuously. 

When I entered the door, I saw Him. His face was peaceful, beautiful. 
Immediately I felt alright. He knew what He was doing. I accepted it 
fully. 

After leaving the room, I went to the back of the line. I waited, and 
again entered; again stared at Him. Again and again I made the circuit. 

It was my last chance to see Him, so why should I do anything else? 

A few hours later, a Dada approached me and asked me if I wanted 
to run the video camera inside Baba's house. 

I accepted, knowing that while it wouldn't be enjoyable, it was a way 
to keep busy, and remain inside Baba's room at the same time. 

I filmed thousands of Margis as they shuffled around the body. Each 
face was unique, but each was filled with anguish. Occasionally, some¬ 
one collapsed, screaming in agony. Some workers and Margis who I 
highly respected, lost all control, and acted with unconscious abandon. 
As for me, at first I believed I had regained my composure. But again 
and again, I lost it, and wept bitterly. 

I filmed many brothers and sisters that I hadn't seen in years. It was 
not the time, however, to say hello. 

Why and how He left 

The Central workers called a meeting of overseas Margis and work¬ 
ers. Who was there who did not wonder why and how Baba had sud¬ 
denly left us? 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


364 


Baba's personal assistant, Dada Keshavananda, told us about the 
days leading up to October 21st: 

"Since August, He was clearly in a hurry. He spent very little time alone, 
instead calling frequent group and individual meetings. Over the last 
weeks, many times in the wee hours of the morning, say 3:00 or 4:00, 
He woke me, and instructed me to call certain workers. The first time it 
happened I told Him that it was 3:00, and that they would surely be 
sleeping. He became angry, and said, If those workers are not here 
within ten minutes, I shall never give them the program that's in my 
mind.' Of course I got them. We all became exhausted with His speed, 
but instead of slowing down, He accelerated. Sometimes we talked 
between ourselves, wondering at the cause of His haste. No one, 
however, came close to imagining that He was busy putting the final 
touches on His life's work. 

"Only one week before His departure, Baba gave kapalika initiation 
to the largest number of workers ever. He requested one hundred 
candidates. Because He had always been very selective in approving 
workers for this purpose, we were not prepared, and could only round 
up seventy-nine. He always rejected more applicants than He approved. 
But this time, without even asking any questions, He approved all. We 
were bewildered at His behavior. 

"Immediately after the initiations, Baba became sick. Well, at least that 
was normal. After taking on many persons' samskaras, He usually 
became sick. And this was by far the biggest number. 

"On the last day, October 21st, His health actually improved. It was 
better than it had been in a long time. The morning was normal. He was 
working with the same tremendous speed that he had shown during 
these last months. Though late on the previous night He had composed 
the final two Prabhat Sangiits (numbers 5017 and 5018), He rose at 
3:00 a.m. as usual to perform His spiritual practices. Later, He reviewed 
the work of various departments and gave instructions while shaving- 
even this was usual for His hectic schedule. He always told us, 'You 
should not only be prepared to die while working, you should even work 
while dying.' These words He clearly practiced. 

"Shortly before 2:00 p.m., He said to me, T want to think.' As I shut 
the door, I thought, He's never said such a thing before. After a 



365 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


few minutes He called me. I believe it was during those minutes that He 
carefully reviewed all His planning, and confirmed that nothing 
remained to be done. He called one of the new avadhutas, and spent one 
hour alone with that Dada. That was the last work of Baba's life-personal 
attention given to a young worker. After that, He said to me, T want to 
rest now.' These words also He had never before spoken. About five 
minutes later, He rang the callbell, and when I came, He pointed at His 
chest, and said, 'Heart.' 

"I immediately ran for the doctors. They came quickly, and began 
massage. But as they felt for Baba's pulse, their faces became ashen. 
When they said, 'The life-force is gone,' we could not believe it." 

Dada Mantreshvarananda, the Central Public Relations Secretary 
said: 

"Why did He leave so suddenly? I remember several years ago, Baba 
said, 'When my work is done, I will leave immediately. I won't remain 
even a single extra moment.' He wrote hundreds of books, provided 
sufficient guidance in every realm of work and life, fully established the 
global structure, and, most importantly, trained the workers. What more 
was there to do? The rest depends on us. 

"Yes, it depends on us. About ten days before, I think it was 12th 
October, during the reporting session, Baba asked us three times, 'Can 1 
depend on you to carry on my mission?' We repeatedly replied, 'Yes, You 
can depend on us.' 

"Many workers wondered what it meant, because the wording im¬ 
plied Baba was leaving us, though no one dared utter such a thought. 
Then He made us take the following oath: 

'All my energy, all my mind, all my thoughts, all my deeds are to be 
goaded unto the path of the collective elevation of human society 
without neglecting other animate and inanimate objects right from this 
moment until the last point of my living on this earth.' 

"The power was such that everyone became super-charged, and felt 
ready to do any work. 

"A few days later, Baba asked me, 'Mantreshvarananda, which Prabhat 
Sangiita do people generally like?' I mentioned a few songs, 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


366 


then I added more, and still I couldn't decide, and added even more. 
Baba said, 'If I give you time, maybe you'll list all the songs. But do 
people like, Tumi esechilekaokenabolenabolia cholegde?" (Meaning: 
You came without telling anyone, and You went back without telling 
anyone.) I said, 'Yes, Baba, that is a very sweet song.' I'll remember 
forever how He smiled at that time. 

"About the same time, while dictating a book to three of us— 
Vijayanandaji, the General Secretary and me—He said, 'Do you know 
that all the doctors are experimenting on me? But they cannot cure me. 
And no one can Cure me. It depends on my samkalpa— my vow of 
determination. If I think disease, disease comes. If I think cure, cure 
comes. And it completely depends on me what I should think.' 

"The Calcutta Circle workers meeting finished on schedule on the 
17th. But Baba did not give those workers permission to leave. This 
violated His long-standing system. The Delhi Sector meeting started, 
and also some global workers arrived. Only on the 21st, did we realize 
He had thus arranged for maximum workers to be here for His Great 
Departure. 

"On the 20th, the night before His departure, He held a meeting for 
Prout workers—both Margis and Dadas. He questioned each Margi, one 
by one, taking their reports. Then He had us repeat the oath, the same 
one which we had pledged in the October 12th meeting. As far as my 
knowledge goes, this was the first and last time He had not only Dadas 
but also Margis collectively making a promise. He then explained the 
situation of the whole world, describing how demonic people are making 
efforts to destroy the social and ecological orders, while good people are 
rapidly uniting together, preparing to fight those demons. 

"Then He said, 'Serpents are exhaling venom everywhere. It is the 
right moment, it is the proper moment, it is the most opportune mo¬ 
ment. Now at this critical juncture, should we go on preaching the gos¬ 
pel of peace? No, no, no! So before my departure from this world, I have 
made the necessary preparation for the fight against these demons.' 

"He added in verse-form: Serpents are exhaling venom everywhere. 
The sweet gospels of peace sound like empty mockery. That is why on 
theeveof my departure from this world, I send out a clarion call to all 
those in every house who are preparing to fight against the demons in 
human form. 



367 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


"We were all shocked. What is this? Baba is departing from this 
world? Then He added, 'So said the great poet Rabindranath Tagore.' 

We all breathed a sigh of relief, believing He had simply been quoting a 
poem. No one guessed that in truth this was His own message, and last 
message .34 

"After the reporting, Baba talked to me alone in His room. He asked 
if everyone was inspired, which I confirmed. Then He asked me what 
they all thought about the poem. I said, 'Baba, it is appropriate, and 
really it is happening in each Margi's life.' He nodded His head. 

One last thing I want to add. Two or three weeks ago, Baba said, 
'Many people may say, "Baba, I love you." In truth, they may or may not 
love. But he who loves my ideology really loves me. Because I have 
merged myself with my ideology.'" 

Himanshuji, Baba's youngest brother, came to Calcutta a few days 
ago, together with several other family members. He said: 

"I was in His room on the last night, the 20th, with some of our 
family. While taking His meal, He spoke to us all, 'Whenever the senior 
person of the family or the guru dies, the others must be very careful for 
one year, because many misfortunes may come.' 

"I didn't accept what He said at face-value, and said, 'Why need it 
happen like that, Baba? It will all be due only to psychological reasons, 
which can be overcome.' 

"'No,' He said. 'There is no scientific explanation. You have simply 
got to accept it. Have you heard the phrase Maha Guru N i Pat? It means 
the departure of the Great Guru. It means the nearest and most dear one 
leaves this world. Do you know what you should do in that case?' 

"As we didn't know, He continued, 'For one year, one should not 
make any luxurious function, construct any special lighting or decora

tion, or arrange any party. Sorrow should be observed for one year. You 
must be very careful for one year.' 

"I believed He was only speaking philosophy or theory. I never imag¬ 
ined we would have to apply His words from the very next day. 

"Another point is that I used to inform Baba of the day I would 
return to my home and take permission from Him to leave. But this 
time, for the first time, He asked me when I was leaving. I was thinking 
of leaving after two days, that is Monday, but I thought He was asking 
because He wanted me to stay much longer. Since I didn't want to annoy 
Him, I couldn't find any words to reply. Then in a loud voice, He said, 
'I'm simply asking if you'll be here tomorrow, Sunday, or not.' I said, 

'Yes, Baba, I'm leaving on Monday.' He said, 'I'm not asking about 
Monday, only Sunday.' 

"At last He sang a folk song of Bihar to us. I laughed at this, thinking 
He was joking. He noticed my laugh, and said, 'It's not ordinary music. 
It's a classical song.' The song's meaning was 'If I will not be here any 
longer, my cart will still continue to move by the power of God.'" 

Dada Vimalananda told us about an incident that explains, perhaps 
better than any, why He had to leave us: 

"A few years ago, during a meeting of Proutists, one Margi asked, 
'Baba, when will Prout be established?' 

"Baba replied, 'When you are perched in a fruit tree, you can only eat 
the fruits on the treet not the ones on the ground. When you stand on 
the ground, you can only eat the fruits which lie on the ground, not the 
ones hanging on the tree. Those who will get This (He pointed to 
Himself), will not get That (meaning Prout society). Which one do you 
want, This or That?' 

"The Margis protested, saying, 'Oh, Baba, We want both. We want 
both Prout and You.' 

"Baba said, 'No, no. You can have only one or the other.' 

"He didn't solve all the problems before He left. He left the guide¬ 
lines, showed some demonstrations, and provided the force to achieve 
the solutions. We have to solve the problems. We have to establish 
Prout." 



369 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


After this story, Vimalanandaji told us another one which explained 
something about the purpose of Baba's life: 

In the early 1960's, when Margis could chat intimately with Baba, 
one Margi — perhaps Dasarath Dada, a family achaya — said, "Baba, 

You meditate every day even though You have no need to meditate. 

What is the object of Your meditation? And, Baba, if You don't mind, 
can You tell us what is Your mantra?" 

Baba became quiet and then said, "I meditate on all of my children 
throughout the world." 

"And Your mantra, Baba?" 

His mood shifted, and some profound emotion swept through His 
facial muscles as He said, "My mantra is Manus'oham (I am a human 
being). If I miss ideating on this mantra for even a single breath, My 
worldly existence becomes jeopardized." 

With these words, Baba took a deep breath, and His body shivered. 
The Margis grabbed His feet, rubbed them and, fearing He might in that 
very moment depart, they cried. 

The orange fire 

Since I've been here, the sky has been overcast. It drizzles continu¬ 
ously-adding to the gloomy feeling. I am told that the weather was fine 
until the moment Baba left on the 21st. This morning, the weather was 
still dismal. 

About ten thousand Margis were gathered on the front lawn in front 
of the Central Office. All of us either sat or stood around the great 
cement funeral pyre which has been constructed in the shape of a six- 
pointed star (as in our symbol). It will remain as a permanent reminder 
of this day. The crowd was abnormally restrained in their behavior. They 
sang non-stop PrabhatSangiit and kiirtan. 

At noon, the pall bearers appeared, carrying an open coffin in which 
Baba lay. Almost in one voice, thousands of persons let out a gasp, then 
a sigh. Though many wept quietly, the overall atmosphere was calm. 
According to Ananda Marga system, a short ceremony to console the 
bereaved was performed in which all participated. A final Guru Puja was 
sung, sung with a feeling never before known. 

Purified butter was poured on His body, the fire lit, and thick, dark 
smoke rose. Exactly at that moment, two things happened. After six 



He Sends Out a Clarion Call 


370 


days of continuous clouds, the sky suddenly cleared sufficiently for the 
sun to shine down brightly, the rays illuminating only the cremation 
area. At the same time, a flock of birds dropped down from the clouds in 
a V-formation, executed a tight circle directly over His body, and flew off 
in steep ascent. 

For three hours the orange fire burned. The crowd continued to sit 
and sing. During all that time, the sun shined brightly. At last, the fire 
was gone, and only the slight remains went on smoking. The sun again 
disappeared, the sky grew cloudy and somber, and gradually the Margis 
dispersed. 

Later in the evening, I was sitting alone on the roof, thinking of 
nothing in particular. I felt freer than ever and full of love for Baba. For 
a moment, my mind looked at itself and wondered why it was feeling so 
peaceful. Immediately I knew: a previously unrecognized impediment in 
my relation with Baba had been burned. 

I found that I had always harbored a fear, deep in my subconscious 
mind, that something in my guru was not perfect, that some sort of 
personal ambition or purpose may have affected Him. Though I had not 
been aware of this fear, it had nevertheless subtly affected me. Now it 
was abundantly clear that He was a man who had not been guided by 
even the minutest ego. His death was the final proof. Though He had 
obviously planned His final moment in detail, He made no drama of it. 

The manner of His departure was in perfect silent harmony with the 
message of His life.

Epilogue 


If my story were divided dramatically, my first years on the spiritual 
path and in Ananda Marga would be Act I, and the period I physically 
knew Baba would be Act II. His physical departure leads me into Act III. 
Act III is the most critical one, for it is in His absence that we will see the 
test of His teachings, His love and the Tantric power that He exudes 
without the burden of a physical body. 

A few years ago, He mentioned in a workers' meeting: "After my 
physical passing, Margis and workers will be blessed with greater psy¬ 
chic and spiritual attention than I am presently able to provide. They 
will be very fortunate." At that time we gave little importance to His 
words, thinking He would remain with us for a long time. 

Though it is still too early to know how Act III will unfold, we can 
take a look at some of the earliest scenes. 

Continuation of H is system 

Calcutta. 28 October. Several newspapers reported: "In the after- 
math of P.R. Sarkar's passing, a great power struggle flares among 
Ananda Marga's Central workers, as they fight over establishing new 
systems and new leadership." As usual, the newspapers write with an 
authority they don't deserve. Here everyone is aware of Baba's warning 
to His brother and other family members that "After M aha Guru Ni Pat, 
the departure of the great guru, for one year you must be very careful." 
No one contemplates making major changes during this period. As the 
Central Committee already exists, it is only necessary to chose a new 
president. 

Today, without fanfare, Dada Shraddhananda was unanimously 
elected for the post. From all corners of our organization, he is regarded 
as a saintly man, simple, straightforward, and uninvolved in

political psychology or favoritism. Over seventy years old, he spent the 
last years working in a small room as Central Finance Secretary and 
editor of the Central newsletter. 

Though it has no relation to the above, now, while writing, I 
suddenly remember my dream of January 1987 104 . Baba gave me a 
glimpse of a symbolic future when I should be careful not to forget Him 
due to the presence of other personalities, no matter how outstanding 
they might be. 

" W hatever happens I planned long ago" 

New Delhi. November. I don't know how many Margis and workers 
told me stories of their dreams or thoughts which clearly foreshadowed 
Baba's departure. I heard so many that it seems like nearly everyone had 
some form of premonition. 

I recall my own experience last June in Ananda Nagar: for the first 
and last time in my life I was wild to see Baba at the close of His con¬ 
cluding discourse. Then I became inconsolably depressed after my last 
look at Him when His car sped away from my sprinting feet. Though I 
was consciously unaware that it was my final moment with Baba, my 
heart obviously felt it. 

Dada Vicitrananda told me about an old Filipina woman. In the 
evening of the 21 st October, she telephoned him at our Manila office. 

"Is there any news about Baba?" she asked. 

"I'm sure He's fine, mother," Dada replied. 

"But I know there's some problem. Can you please call Calcutta? I 
cannot telephone from my little village." 

"Alright, don't worry, mother." 

She called an hour later, saying, "Did you get through, Dadaji?" 

"I couldn't get the line yet, mother." "Please. Please keep trying." 

He had not tried. Now he knew she would go on troubling him until 
he confirmed Baba's health. So he called Calcutta. He was shocked to 
hear that Baba was lying in trance. 


1M That was the dream when I was on a mountain together with unknown M argi mountain¬ 
peoplelistening to the two leaders of Ananda M arga. I forgot about Baba, who had become an 
old man.

Travels with the Mystic Master 


Vacitranandaji then called the old lady, and said, "Mother, you were 
right. Baba is not well. He is in some sort of trance." "No. No. It's worse 
than that," she said. 

One hour later, Dada called Calcutta again, and heard that Baba was 
no more. After going through his own agony, he called the old lady. 

"Mother ... you ... were right. Baba is ... gone." 

There was a moment of silence, then she hung up the phone without 
a word. 

Today I was on a train with Dada Bodhprajinananda who told me 
the following story: 

"On lith August in Minali, India, I had a dream. I was in Tiljala 
(Calcutta). I saw Baba's body on the main stage. It was covered with a 
sheet, lying on a cot. A huge number of Margis and workers sat in front 
of Him, and everyone was weeping. 

"I went near His body, though I also was crying. I lifted the cloth 
from His face, and said to Him, 'Baba, You left us without proper guid¬ 
ance and direction. How will we remain in this world? How will we 
establish our organizational system, Prout, and a moralist society?' 

"Then Baba woke up, sat up smiling, and said, 'Whatever I had to 
give, I have given. You do more and more kiirtan and meditation. Do as 
much noble work for the cause of society as you can. I am always with 
you. Go ahead.' 

"Then again He laid down, and the dream finished. 

"I told the Margi in whose house I was staying (he is a bank man¬ 
ager). Also Dada Harimayananda was with me, and I told him too. They 
encouraged me to call Calcutta to see if Baba was alright. I called, and 
found out Baba had just entered hospital, and was very sick. 

"After two months, when He really died, the thought of this dream 
helped me very much to overcome my sorrow." 

There are many such stories. But let's leave it at that for today. 

Dada Aksayananda tells another story. It is a long story, but this one 
will have to win the final prize for experiences showing how Baba pre¬ 
planned everything. 

Dada said: 



Epilogue

In 1979, Ananda Marga purchased a house in Lake Gardens, Calcutta 
for our Marga Guru Quarters. I was then Baba's second personal 
assistant. I frequently had the chance to talk with Him while performing 
massage. It was shortly after moving into the new house. I was alone 
with Him when I said, "Baba, at last there is a house in Calcutta which 
belongs to us. How would it be if we were to plant the grounds around 
the building and make a garden on the roof?" 

"You can do it," He replied, "but do you know what the result will be? If 
you plant around the house, the roots of the plants will damage the 
building's foundation. If you make a roof garden, the roof will be spoiled 
by water draining out of the flower pots." 

We didn't talk for a few minutes. When I looked at His face He 
seemed to be sleeping. Then a thought occurred to me. I started thinking 
we should get a much larger piece of land than this with a bigger house. 
Then I could make a big garden away from the building. There Baba 
could walk and enjoy the plants and the fresh air. 

"Aksayananda, are you saying anything?" Baba suddenly asked. 

"Nothing, Baba." 

"No, no. You were telling me something." 

I understood that Baba had been listening to my thoughts, so I re¬ 
plied, "Yes, Baba," and expressed my thoughts to Him. Baba only smiled 
and kept silent. He became reserved and silent for a few minutes. Then 
Baba closed His eyes for more than ten minutes. I wondered whether 
Baba was angry at me because at first I had told Him that I liked the new 
house, and then had started talking about getting another. 

Quite suddenly, Baba asked me to come near. I went close to His 
head, but Baba still did not open His eyes. I said, "Yes, Baba." 

He opened His eyes with a loving smile, and placed both His palms 
on my cheeks. 

"Yes, my son, what you thought may come true some day." He asked 
me to sit in meditation pose, close my eyes, and keep my mind con¬ 
centrated in my sixth chakra. He then asked me what I saw. 

I told Baba that I saw a grand house surrounded by beautiful trees 
and many plants. He told me to go further and see more. Then I heard 
the sounds of hundreds of birds and saw that they were flying from tree 
to tree. Again Baba asked me to see more. I told Him that I saw Him 
walking under the trees on a narrow path. Some Dadas were with Him. 
Baba asked me to go towards the house.

"What are you seeing now?" 

"Baba, I see that the building has two parts, one on the east and one on 
the west. Also there are a few underground rooms." "Go inside the 
western room. What do you see there?" "Baba, there are rooms but no 
one is there." "Go downstairs to the underground room." "Baba, there's 
not enough light to see clearly." "Go outside and look around." 

"Baba, I see the rooms in the eastern part of the building." 

"Go inside. Now tell me what you see." 

"Baba, there are many Dadas and Didis there." 

"Go further inside. Tell me what you see." 

"There is a door, but it's closed." 

"Open it. What do you see?" 

"I see You there, Baba, lying on a bed." 

"All right. Come out of the room and go upstairs. What do you see?" 
"Baba, there is a big function going on with many people, and the 
room is beautifully decorated. Baba, You are sitting there with some 
other people." 

"Can you recognize them?" 

"No, Baba. I have never seen them before." 

"Is anybody else there?" 

"Yes. Two Dadas are doing something. They seem very busy." 

"And what else do you see?" 

"Baba, I see a marriage going on." 

"Can you recognize the bride and groom?" 

"No, Baba." 

"Now come downstairs. What do you see?" 

"A fountain." 

"And now what do you see?" 

"Baba, I see you going up in an elevator," I answered with 
surprise. "Go inside again. What do you see now?" "Baba, all the 
Dadas and Didis are weeping." "Ask them why they are weeping." 
"Baba, I am asking them, but no one is replying. They just raise their 
heads and look at me. No one will answer." "Ask them again."

"Baba, they are simply weeping, and not replying." 

"All right. Come out now. Do you recognize the location of the 

house?" 

"It is somewhere in Calcutta, Baba, but not in Lake Gardens." 

Then the demonstration was over. He said, "Don't tell anyone about 
this just now. Keep it to yourself for now." 

Not long after, I was transferred to Kerala State. In January 1983 ,1 
made my first visit to Baba's new residence in Tiljala, Calcutta. There 
was no way for me to express my inner joy at finding that what Baba had 
shown me a few years before was now coming true. 

Years later, on 11 September 1990, Baba came out of the hospital and 
at midnight He called for me. While I was massaging Him, He asked me 
to talk quietly about something so that He would feel sleepy. 

"Baba, what you showed me in that demonstration in 1979 has come 
completely true now to the last detail. I had been wondering if the foun¬ 
tain would really be built, but it had come just as it was in the vision. 
Lastly the elevator was installed and reality was completely like my 
vision. I thought now I could tell everyone." 105 
"You are forgetting one feature of the things I showed you. Try to 
recollect." 

I tried and tried to remember, but I could not remember anything 
that was not already there in reality. I asked Baba to please tell me what 
it was that I had forgotten. 

"When the time comes, you will remember everything. You see, 
whatever happens I planned it all long ago. Whenever I take determina¬ 
tion for any purpose, that thing must happen and no one can stop it." 

The next month, Baba left His physical body. 

Recently I went to Madras to conduct a spiritual seminar. As I gave a 
talk about Baba, I suddenly remembered the missing element in my 
vision that Baba had referred to. Yes, after Baba's passing, all the Dadas 
and Didis wept in Baba's quarters for two days. None of us could speak 
even if we tried. We just looked at each other and wept. 

With You in Your room 

Tokyo. I miss Baba so much, that there is a constant ache in my 
chest. Early this morning, however, He relieved it slightly by a dream— 
my first dream of Him after His passing: 


105 The marriage of Baba's adopted son K inshuk had also been held. 



377 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


After having fieldwalk with Baba, I was with Him and several other 
workers in His room in Calcutta. A few minutes passed in normal dis¬ 
cussions, during which He smiled and joked. Then He turned to speak 
confidentially to me. 

He said, "What do you dearly want?" 

I looked up and saw my answer written in three-dimensional letters 
suspended in the air. I read this reply to Him, without understanding 
what I was saying. 

Understanding carries no weight, I thought. Only feeling matters. 
Only love matters. 

Baba spoke intimately with me, "But there is someone else, isn't 

there?" 

"There's no one else for me, Baba," I said. 

"What about that lady in your class?" He asked. 

It took me a moment, and then I knew whom He meant. I almost 
laughed, because my feeling for her was simply as a student. 

"No, it's nothing," I said. "Only You." 

He smiled. It was only playful lovers' talk, and of course He knew the 
truth. He hugged me tightly, and I began to cry, feeling I would again 
soon be separated from Him. 

"Please post me in India or anywhere that I can be close to You, 

Baba. I want to be with You in Your room." Now I remembered that this 
is what the three-dimensional letters said. So I added, "This is what I 
want more than anything else." 

He didn't reply, so I embraced Him more closely, completely, and 
went on crying. 

In this state I woke up, and indeed I was crying. My pillow was 
soaked in tears. I rubbed my face in those tears, and felt Him inside of 
me. 

And I knew this was His strange way of comforting me—for, though 
my throat swelled and tears flowed, the top of my head throbbed rhyth¬ 
mically and all the cells of my body quivered with His blissfulness. 

Our case with Amnesty temporarily rests 

1991. The woman from Amnesty International called me, saying, 
"I'm sorry, we have not yet received a reply from our London office 
concerning your case. I'm very concerned about the persecution in 
Ananda Nagar, so I intend to give London a big push. I thought to ask if 
you have any more information or documents you'd like to add."

"I'm very thankful to you," I said, "but there's been a change. You 
see, in October, P.R. Sarkar, the propounder of Ananda Marga, passed 
away." 

"Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that." 

"No need to be sorry. There's benevolent purpose in everything. 

Since then, the daily attacks at Ananda Nagar have ceased. It's now 
completely peaceful, and we are free to engage in purely constructive 
work." 

"Oh, well, that's a great relief to me." 

"I might add that the violence stopped, I guess, because the com¬ 
munists believe Ananda Marga will crumble in the absence of Sarkar. 
But we always gain strength out of adverse conditions. The annual gath¬ 
ering in Ananda Nagar, which was concluded a few days ago, was even 
bigger than usual. More than 20,000 people attended. Many were new 
people who had not even seen Sarkar. So, I wouldn't be surprised if, 
after watching our development for a few months or so, the communists 
recommence their attacks against us." 

"Well, I sure hope not. In any case, I'll keep your files safe. Let me 
know if the trouble starts up again." 

"You will see it. But I will not." 

Taipei. A few days ago, Dada Pranavatmakananda interviewed Mr 
N.C. Ganguli, an old colleague of Baba's from the Jamalpur Railway 
accounts office. 106 He never learned meditation, though he held Baba 
in highest esteem. Ganguli said that daily after lunch many of the staff 
would gather around Baba's desk for discussion. Sometime in 1952, 

Baba was talking to them about communism. He said it was an inhu¬ 
mane philosophy, and therefore would not survive for long. It would 
eventually completely disappear from the world. Not only would com¬ 
munism face such a fate, even the Soviet Union itself would disintegrate. 

At that time Stalin's nation was a powerful force, so the statement 
was in every sense surprising. (Even now that communism is in trouble, 


106 Since shortly after Baba'spassing, Pranavatmakanandaji hashad a special duty which I 
envy. He is incharge of collecting the accounts of Baba-experiences from M argis, non-M argis 
and workers. The amount of material has so far been enormous— already hundreds of video 
tapes. We can guess that hiscompleted reports will contain sufficient new information for 
writing scores of booksabout Baba.

it does not appear likely that the USSR will collapse.) So Ganguli asked, 
"Prabhat Ranjan, will we see all this within our lifetime?" Baba replied, 
"You will see it. But I will not." 107 

Pranavatmakanandaji also told me of another incident from that 
Jamalpur office. One of Baba's colleagues clearly remembered that 
around 1959, Baba told him, "In my family the longevity is not more 
than seventy years. My grandfather and my father both died early. So 
there is very little chance that I'll cross seventy. If I were to cross sev¬ 
enty, then I would personally show the world the power of my ideology. 
But there is very little chance of that." 

Baba died at the age of sixty-nine. 

Why He didn't allow me to meet H im in jail 

Komsomolsk, Russia. Some part of the first Vedas were composed in 
central Russia 15,000 years ago. 108 Those Aryan people migrated 
southeast, where they mixed their Vedic culture with the Tantric culture 
of the peoples of northeast India. Though the Aryans were an aggressive 
warlike people, they were knowledgable about spiritual philosophy. 

The effect of those days seems to remain here, because many Rus¬ 
sians are extremely thirsty for psychic and spiritual experience. I found 
them intelligent, dynamic, and usually responsible; and they are en¬ 
thusiastic about anything having an occult flavor. (That my picture of 
them should not appear over rosy, let me add that they also have a ten¬ 
dency toward over-argumentation and over-intellectualization.) 109 


107 Though Ganguli did indeed witness the disintegration of the U SSR the following December, 
at the time of this entry no one could confidently predict such a development. 

108 Veda means deep knowledge. The Vedic scriptures are the most ancient and voluminous of 
all the Indian spiritual literature. The Vedic writings are more philosophical and theoretical, 
while the Tantric texts are more practical. 

109 T0 make this picture even more complete I should mention that I later worked in M ongolia. 
Though most M ongoliansare not so desperate for spiritual knowledge like the Russians, they 
have a greater tendency toward a spiritually-centered lifestyle. Before communism took over 

M ongolia, it was nick-named " Little India" because of its affinity for spiritual culture. The 
people seem as simple as the renowned devotees from K rishna's time, who were cowherds.

Ananda Marga is growing at such speed that our workers must be 
careful not to pass most of their time only fulfilling requests to teach 
meditation or answering endless questions. The need for organizing 
social work is just as great. Fortunately, Margis of Japan and Taiwan are 
proving helpful in arranging medical equipment, clothing, and other 
donations. Local government bodies, clubs and organizations are also 
cooperative. In fact, for every offer of cooperation that we accept, there 
are many others that we are forced to reject due to our own limitations. 

Our new Margis hired a professional translator, who is regarded as 
the foremost English speaker of Khabarovsk. When we requested her to 
join our meditation, she hesitated and said, "I don't really think I am 
capable of such a thing." Eventually she did sit with us, for a full hour. 
Afterward she said, "There must be something wrong with me. I couldn't 
help crying throughout almost the entire meditation." Imagine, this lady 
who had not the slightest Tantric knowledge, has already had an 
awakening of the spiritual force in her spine. 

I remember what Baba told me during a walk in Germany in 1979: 

"In the future, big spiritual festivals will be held in both Moscow and 
Beijing." At the time I could not imagine how our programs could be 
openly held in the two countries which most represented the suppression 
of spirituality. 

Khabarovsk, Russia. During a question-and-answer session with a 
group of Margis, a sister said, "It is clear to all of us that Dadas and Didis 
possess immense devotion for Baba. Some of us also feel a little love for 
Him. But how can we ever hope to achieve a deep communion with 
Guru, when we are unable to meet Him? You were lucky. We are un¬ 
lucky." 

Before replying, I momentarily thought of Baba, as I always try to do 
before any action, and, without expecting it, a flood of energy rose in my 
spine. All my cells tingled as the answer thrust itself before my eyes—an 
answer I had searched for so long. There was that question that 
remained unanswered within me for so many years: Why had He caused 
me such intense suffering by not allowing me to meet Him during my 
first seven years as a worker? Why did He stop me that day I was 
determined to break into His Patna prison cell? Why did He pull me into 
a trance while sitting in the prison office during which He

psychically stroked my head and said, "There is a very good reason why 
I am not allowing you to meet me... a very good reason". I finally knew 
the reason! It was for the sake of people who would never be able to 
physically meet Him, to whom I could say with uncontrived conviction: 
"Relation with Guru is a purely spiritual matter. Meeting Him was 
beautiful, but it carries no guarantee. Though my words may sound 
trite, I can only repeat, the true Guru, the eternal lover, the eternal 
guide, the eternal One—is within you. But He is a jealous lover, who will 
only embrace you if you truly care for Him." 

And when such people say, "But, Dada, that's only philosophy- 
then I explain my experience. I offer my Baba story. Though it is a story 
which is far from finished.

During the author’s meetings with Baba, some of His talks were 
somewhat technical. Because readers may or may not be interested, 
these talks have been taken out of the main text and placed in this 
appendix. 

On microvita 

[Many readers may find this entry difficult to understand. Never¬ 
theless, it has been included to provide a slight exposure to the intricacy 
of Baba's philosophy. It is important to recognize that the below notes 
are in no way authoritative on the subject of microvita. They merely 
reproduce exactly two entries in the author's diary. There may easily be 
mistakes in the logic here, or in the recall of the exact phrases of Baba.] 

Calcutta, 1989. During the usual workers' meeting philosophy ses¬ 
sion, Baba asked me a new question: 

BABA: Birth, death and reproduction are the signs of animation. 
What is the status of microvita in the case of animation and inanima¬ 
tion? (The General Secretary waves at me. I step forward.) 

GENERAL SECRETARY: Dharmavedananda from Hong Kong 
Sector, Baba. 

BABA: What is his posting? 

GENERAL SECRETARY: He is PRS (Public Relations Secretary). 

BABA: PRS ... PRS ... acha, you mean Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar? (After 
our laughter finishes, He continues.) So, tell me, what is the status of 
microvita in the case of animation and inanimation? 

ME: Positive microvita are most important in the evolution of ani¬ 
mate entities—as they tend toward consciousness. Negative microvita 
play the leading role for inanimate entities. 



Technical Talks by Baba 


384 


BABA: Positive and negative microvita influence living beings, and 
life is dormant in inanimate entities. Positive microvita and negative 
microvita can only function on the periphery of inanimate entities. Oth¬ 
erwise, positive and negative microvita have no direct relation with in¬ 
animate entities. 

ME: Now I understand. Neutral microvita have the dominant posi¬ 
tion in inanimate entities. 

BABA: Can inanimate be transmuted into animate? 

ME: Yes. 

BABA: What is the covert role of microvita in the process? How does 
Cosmic Mind guide the process? 

ME: The Cosmic Mind does not act directly, but through the medium 
of microvita. 

BABA: Does Cosmic Mind take the help of microvita? 

ME: Yes. 

BABA: Microvita are created in the introversial phase only.... You 
made a very good effort. (He points at His forehead, saying,) You should 
go on thinking deeply to get the final answer.... Now come forward. (I do 
so. He places His hand on my head. An indescribable blissful feeling fills 
my head, and then runs down and up my spine.) He's a good boy. Yesss. 

The reporting finished after a few minutes. I then immediately sat 
for meditation. Though the feeling He gave me continued during medi¬ 
tation, my wandering thoughts related only to our conversation. It oc¬ 
curred to me that inanimate entities consist of neutral or dormant 
microvita. The inanimate entities are gradually converted into animate 
entities by the effect of a smattering of positive microvita naturally ema¬ 
nating from Cosmic Mind. 

Two weeks later. Hsinchu, Taiwan. It was 3:00 in the morning. The 
Margis had gone home only thirty minutes before, full of my stories and 
Tantric talk. Only brother Yatindra and I were left in the yoga house. I 
desperately needed to sleep, but since Yatindra (a scientist) was eager to 
discuss more about microvita, I thought it would be rude to disappoint 
him. Though my eyes were closed and I was reclining on the floor, I 
went on trying to answer his questions, my mind constantly slipping in 
and out of waking consciousness. 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


Suddenly my body uncontrollably bolted upright. I was blasted awake. 

"What happened, Dada?" hesaid. 

"I don't know. As I drifted in and out of sleep, my mind shifted into 
super-drive without warning and I understood something I never un¬ 
derstood before. Something perhaps no one except Baba understood 
before." 

"W hat is it!" Yatindra was even more excited than I was. 

"Animate and inanimate are not interchangeable with sainchara 
and prati-sainchara (the extroversial and introversial phases of 
creation). I can see this great misunderstanding existing among our 
Margii philosophers. We always thought that sainchara (extroversial 
phase) was the creation and evolution of inanimate objects like ether, 
air, light, liquids and solids; and that prati-sainchara (introversial 
phase) was the evolution of animate entities like plants, animals and 
humans. But I've just seen that sainchara is the evolution of physical 
matter, and that prati-sainchara is the evol ution of psychic entities—I 
mean unit minds. 

"Now, here's the crux of this topic: The association of a unit mind 
with a group of physical cells is what wecall an animate entity. But the 
matter of those so-called animate cells is actually still in the sainchara 
phase. It istheunitmind alonewhich isin the prati-sainchara phase." 

"But that's completely different than what we've always 
imagined!" Yatindra said. 

"Wait," I said, looking more carefully at the revelation still erupt¬ 
ing in my mind. I talked at locomotive speed, while Yatindra took 
notes. "There's more. When a human being practices meditation, she 
or he may convert the most subtle physical cells of the body into mind 
stuff— this is one of the turning points from sainchara into prati- 
sainchara, from matter to mind. Of course, this is possible because 
everything is ultimately the expression of Cosmic Mind, even 
inanimate matter, though its unit mind is dormant. 

"Now, microvita also have minds and bodies. Their minds are in 
the prati-sainchara phase; their bodies in sainchara. Of course, the 
bodies of bigger microvita are made of smaller microvita, but 
ultimately when we get down to the smallest constituent microvita, we 
find those having no solid or liquid body, only mind with a luminous 
body. Even 



Technical Talks by Baba 


386 


those luminous microvita bodies are in the sain char a phase, while their 
minds are in prati-sainchara. 

"In the case of inanimate entities, the minds of the microvita con¬ 
stituents are inactive/unexpressed/dormant/neutral. In the case of ani¬ 
mate entities, the microvita minds are predominantly active, and those 
active microvita minds are either positive or negative. 

"To speak of a microvita as being positive or negative means that the 
mind of that microvita is positive or negative—not the body. To speak of 
a human being or a goat does not mean their respective bodies, but 
rather the human mind or the goat mind. The associated bodies of 
microvita, human beings and goats are all physical entities moving in the 
sanitary phase. 

"Listen to this: Sainchara and prati-sainchara are functioning 
within each and every animate entity on varying levels. In a single 
human being there may be billions of separate entities independently 
evolving within both sainchara and prati-sainchara. Positive and 
negative microvita affect unit minds, and unit minds affect their 
associated physical bodies. In that way, the body of an animate entity 
can become diseased or cured of disease by microvita. Microvita do not 
directly affect those bodies, but rather, the minds associated with those 
bodies. The individual atoms and molecules which serve as the building 
blocks of a living cell remain unaffected by positive and negative 
microvita. 

"Just as a ball circling on the end of a string has both centripetal and 
centrifugal force (depending on one's perspective), so sainchara and 
prati-sainchara come into existence simultaneously. They cannot be 
separated from each other. For that reason there is no conflict that 
microvita (whose minds are created in prati-sainchara) serve as the 
components or building blocks of saincharic matter. But those microvita 
serving to make up inanimate objects must be predominantly neutral." 

Yatindra threw down his notes, yelled, "Baba!," jumped up and 
started dancing around the room. 

Perhaps this is the beginning of what Baba meant when He said to 
me, "You should go on thinking deeply to get the final answer." 

One more small but interesting thought also occurred to me: Baba 
directed many of His books to be compiled into different series. For 
example, all His books and articles on Prout come together to make 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


about 1400 pages of Prout in a Nutshell having over twenty volumes. 
Similarly we've got Nutshell series on Microvita, Neo-Humanism, 
Ananda Marga general philosophy, and so on. Margis often comment, 
"Only Baba could call this number of volumes nutshells." Now I un¬ 
derstand: He titles them nutshells because He wants us to think deeply, 
research and thoroughly expand His ideas. 

On the history of the Arab and M oslem movement throughout the world 

[The author took the following notes during Baba's fieldwalk:] 

Valencia, Spain, 1979. Culturally and historically Iberia was not a 
part of the Roman empire in the past. The creation of the Moors' society 
was a reaction to the western part of the Arab movement. The northern 
portion of Saudi Arabia up to the northern part of Palestine was Arabia. 
They were nomads and heathens. It means that they had no faith in 
God—they were intellectually backward. But they were highly developed 
in astronomy, astrophysics, algebra and math because the land was 
desert, and under the pressure of circumstances they needed to learn to 
follow the stars. At least in these fields the Arabs were not backward. 

About 1400 years ago they became Moslem, and gave up the Semitic 
culture. Originally the Arabs and Jews were one culture. The Arabs were 
heathens, whereas the Jews knew a little of God. Some of the Arabs 
became Christian 2000 years ago. 1369 years ago they became Moslems. 
They expelled the Jews from Palestine and adjacent places. The Jews 
became homeless. They were transported to different countries like 
Great Britain and the Soviet Union. 

After occupying all of Palestine, the Arabs spread to the north, that is 
Yugoslavia. In the east they stretched out to the Philippines in southeast 
Asia. In the south past Ceylon to the Maldives Islands. To the west they 
came to the Atlantic, crossed northern Africa, the Sahara, Egypt, Sudan, 
Tripoli, Tunisia and Morocco. They destroyed the original Egyptian 
culture. Those were the Egyptians who knew the science of the 
preservation of dead bodies. The present Egyptians are not the de¬ 
scendants of those ancient Egyptians. Rather they are a transplanted 
Arab population. 

After the western march they commenced an eastern march. Seventy 
five percent of that eastern march was stopped in India. That is 



Technical Talks by Baba 


388 


why it resorted to waterways through islands up to the Philippines. The 
march could not go to China and Japan. It was checked forever. When 
the Spanish occupied the Philippines they stopped the Arabs. In the 
southern march they could not go past the Maldives Islands. In the 
northern march they proceeded up to Yugoslavia; there the movement 
stopped due to extreme cold climate, where they could not show bravery 
and valor. Similarly the Germans were defeated when they attacked the 
Russians in the winter. 

In the west the Atlantic Ocean stopped the Arab march. From Mo¬ 
rocco they went north through Gibraltar to invade Iberia. Their desire 
was to move to the Bay of Basque. But it was difficult to cross the 
Pyrenees Mountains. And they could not occupy Portugal because the 
Arab navy was very weak. The Portuguese were strong. The people of 
Iberia had to fight by tooth and nail. The Arabs who came from Morocco 
were known as Moors. The western march stopped after reaching Spain. 
Islam was restricted to these boundaries of the world. 

You will have to preach Ananda Marga southward of Gibraltar-just 
the opposite course of the Arabs. But you will not preach through the 
sword. Your message will be spread through love and social service. Love 
is a stronger weapon than the sword. 

Here there are left only a few certain marks of the Arabs in the 
cultural life. Otherwise the Arab presence is no longer here. Now they 
are as dead as the dodo. The dodos were a pigeon group which came to 
certain islands in the Arabian Sea where there were no humans present 
to kill them. Therefore they lost their capacity to fly. Their bodies 
became bulky, as they had no need for self-defense. When people from 
other countries finally went there, they caught ready meat just with their 
bare hands. The last dodo died about too years ago. Anything which is 
fully dead is now called in people's English dead as the dodo. 

Something should be written regarding the cultural side of Spain— 
the post-Moor culture. What was the influence of the Moors on Spain? 
The main population of Iberia is Caucasian of Mediterranean offshoot, 
with close proximity to the Italians and southern French. Their color is 
white—not reddish-white like the Germans. Their hair is black, not gray- 
black like the Germans. The brownish-black skin and hair is from the 
Moors. And you will hardly find such a man today in Spain. In the 
anthropological life of Spain, there is little influence of the Arabs. But in 
the language there remain a few distorted Arabian words. 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


[He gave some examples, which the author could not properly note 
down.] 

Finally the original land of the Moors was occupied by the French. It 
became a colony. 

Strengthen yourselves in north Africa. We will attack from Spain with 
love. But we shall say to them we are not your born enemies. They may 
say, 'We hate you.' We will say, 'We love you.' 

On increasing agricultural production 

[Dada Vijayananda gave a class explaining many of Baba's sugges¬ 
tions about how to increase agricultural production, especially in de¬ 
veloping countries. The author's notes of this class follow:] 

Calcutta, 1988. To take care of the security and welfare of the people 
of any developing country, the production level should be increased. 
Bangladesh imports much of what it needs because in many areas only 
one or two crops are grown per year. Most crops should be harvested 
three or four times per year in poor countries. Poor countries are usually 
densely populated, thus every inch of land must be used judiciously. 
Mixed farming is required. Staple crops especially must be produced 
four times per year. The priorities are in order: 1) cereals 2) oil-pro¬ 
ducing seeds and pulses 3) vegetables. 

Where there is little rain, seeds should first be planted for six weeks 
in a small field for ease of watering. Then the seedlings should be trans¬ 
planted for another 80 or 85 days in large fields. If any crop yield takes 
as long as four months then there must be a subsidiary crop such as oil 
seeds. In the same field both cereals and oil-seeds may be grown. This is 
an example of mixed farming. Between the deep-rooted plants, put the 
short-rooted oil-seed plants—or other short-rooted plants like cloves, 
turmeric or ginger. In that case manure will not be needed because oil¬ 
seeds add needed natural elements to the land, so that it becomes fertile. 
Chemical fertilizers decrease the inter-molecular space in the soil. If you 
use chemicals sometimes, you must always use them. But vegetable and 
animal fertilizers cause no bad reaction. 

Pumping water from below the earth's surface is not good for irri¬ 
gation because the water table will go down. A three inches drop in the 
water table per too years is normal. When pumping is done, it will 
increase to about six inches per too years. The Calcutta area is 



Technical Talks by Baba 


390 


one of the worst—it is now sinking eight inches every too years due to 
intense water pumping. The perennial rivers offer the best source for 
irrigation. 

Where the saline water-level is too high, it is better to pipe in sweet- 
water, even if it must be done from too miles away. When farming is 
done with sweet-water for five to ten years, the saline level will decrease 
and become normal. 

Normally potatoes take 90 days to mature. But in 60 days it is also 
possible to harvest the potatoes and make dehydrated potato powder. 
Otherwise it cannot easily be preserved. Only 90-day potatoes can be 
kept a long time in cold storage. 

Rivers coming from dead mountains do not carry soil. They carry 
sand. In sandy areas it is best to take away three feet of the sandy soil, 
put a layer of polythene plastic, and put the sandy soil back. Then water 
and manure will not sink away so easily. This is an example of an idea 
with which Baba personally experimented. In the desert there is only 
sand without even soil, so lime must be added. 

When land is very dry, then non-mulberry silk-worms can be pro¬ 
duced. When the cocoons are put into water, they yield fiber for silk 
threads. In two or three months, too silk-worms increase to 20,000. 
Also wool-sheep can be maintained wherever there are high hills. 

Nature has given all different types of soil, and in each place some¬ 
thing important grows. We can also create new plants for the desert and 
other areas of low fertility. 

G rassroots planning 

The best planning is not done only by the high level bosses but also 
by the volunteers on the lowest local level. Then only can that planning 
be realistic. For that reason, Baba gave the slogan for all Margi district 
in-charges: "Know the area, prepare the plan, serve the people." District 
in-charges coming from any part of the world were tested by Baba on 
the following items relating to their own districts: 

1. topography or natural environment, plus temperature, flora 
and fauna 

2. agricultural potentialities 

3. industrial potentialities 

4. nature of soil 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


5. availability of natural resources 

6. rivers and valleys 

7. block-level planning covering all aspects of social life 

8. how to develop the language 

9. participation of indigenous peoples in agricultural and industry 

10. rainfall 

11. soil erosion 

12. landscape 

13. farming in arid lands, coastal belt (saline problems) 

14. sources of energy 

15. type of irrigation prominent and possible 

16. name and meaning of their own people's movement 

17. international and state river links 

18. classical language from which local language originated 

19. scope for auxiliary agriculture (fisheries, beekeeping, poultry, 
dairy farms, horticulture, orchards) 

20. scope for setting up machine tool stations 

21. technique of farming according to nature of land, e.g. plain land, 
highland, lowland, arid land, saline zone, mountain zone 

22. ecological balance 

23. scope for encouraging reforestation and discouraging 
deforestation. 


On solving Bangladesh's economic problems 

[From the author's notes of Baba's talk during a workers' meeting:] 

Calcutta, 1989. Baba explained how Bangladesh, one of the world's 
poorest nations, can solve its problems: 

First analyze the country's raw materials. It sells untanned hide and 
raw jute (fiber for rough cloth) in the international market. It has vir¬ 
tually no metallic materials and very little underground fuel such as raw 
gas. The best system for such a country is barter trade. 

If Bangladesh were to process the hide and jute itself would its 
economy improve? These processes are complicated and costly, so it 
would not be useful. Also, synthetics are rapidly replacing both raw 
materials. The jute industry is a sick industry because it cannot easily 
compete. Many producers have closed, and the government has been 



Technical Talks by Baba 


392 


forced to subsidize the industry. Thailand also produces jute, but its jute 
is superior. And Thailand is not an underdeveloped nation. Previously 
England processed Indian jute in England itself. After Indian inde¬ 
pendence in 1947, England could no longer purchase jute from India, so 
they created synthetics. It is clear that Bangladesh must change its 
industry. 

Japan is importing raw materials from around the world. If those 
countries become politically conscious, they will stop exporting to Ja¬ 
pan. This will happen in the near future. Orissa is exporting manganese 
and iron ore to Japan, but they will soon stop. 

Suppose Bangladesh stops jute, and increases rice production. Rice 
can be easily grown there. Will that solve their problem? In that case, 
Bangladesh will become self-sufficient in food, but will not have any 
basis for international commercial transaction, which will deprive it of 
many basic needs. 

What is the way out? Some advocate that jute should be mixed with 
artificial materials and wool. Also the jute stem can be used to make 
nylon. These approaches are still only the best of a bad lot. From the end 
of winter to the end of the rainy season is the time for growing jute. Can 
anything else be grown then? Only sesame, perhaps linseed also, which 
has a big international market and can also be used to make petroleum. 
But this is not the immediate solution. Jute must continue in the short 
term, but only that amount which is needed for local industries. Raw 
jute should not be exported. Only finished products should be exported. 

To solve the problem, developmental projects should be initiated 
which are based on the availability of local materials. Some propose the 
widespread establishment of coconut plantations. The salinity of the soil 
in Dacca is insufficient. But palmira or tal (palm) can be grown. Coconut 
grows nicely in Nokali district. Plastic can be manufactured from the 
husk. Jessore and its adjacent areas are also good for coconut. 

As to natural resources, there are hardly any raw minerals available. 
Non-ferrous industries can be developed. There is some gas and oil 
available, but not much. From where should the power come? Hydro¬ 
electricity is not possible because rivers are in the delta stage. They must 
be in the hilly stage, and must have sufficient force. To avoid 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


flooding, they should have many dikes like Holland, and fully utilize the 
water. The very wide rivers we see now are due to deforestation and the 
stripping away of vines. So large banks must be constructed, and 
massive reforestation done. For now, power can be derived from ocean 
tides and from solar energy. Ocean tide energy is tapped where rivers 
enter the ocean. It is cheap and efficient. Solar power facilities are not 
yet sufficiently developed, but will become more efficient soon. There is 
not much possibility to obtain thermal power—the coal is too young. It 
needs another 800,000 to one million years. But at that point human 
beings will no longer live on this planet. Bio-gas production will help 
solve the problem of manure, which is also a chronic problem. 

Horticulture is also good. (He gave many details concerning beans, 
jackfruit, mango, etc.) Crops of the tropical zones are good. Temperate 
zone crops are not suitable. The quantity of fish has decreased because 
there is insufficient rotting materials due to deforestation. Before there 
was about 2400 square kilometers of forest, but now it is less than 1000 
square kilometers. (Perhaps I misunderstood Him on these figures.) 
Bangladesh needs large-scale reforestation and preserves. Pineapples 
need 60 inches of rainfall per year. The average in Bangladesh is 80 
inches except in one region. Pineapples give food and also material for 
making cloth. Litchis and silk are both good. Cotton is not suitable. 
Mulberry wood is good for producing sporting goods and also rayon. If 
mulberry wood is hardened, it becomes hard as iron, and can be used in 
construction. There can be production of banana chips, dried fruits and 
washing soap. By burning banana leaves enough sodium bicarbonate 
can be manufactured to serve the world. 

Just to distract the unsophisticated population from the govern¬ 
ment's lack of proper planning, the government excites the people 
through non-issues, like declaring Bangladesh a Muslim state. This was 
happened at the time of the epic flooding. 

Proper planning will not become a reality until the voters are edu¬ 
cated. Even if they do not become politically educated, at least they 
should become politically conscious. 

On the evolution of languages throughout the world 

[Baba frequently spoke on the subject of language. Even when 
speaking about something else, He commonly went on linguistic de 



Technical Talks by Baba

tours, explaining the derivation of important words. These notes are 
included not because they are exceptional, but to give an example of a 
lecture on His pet subject.. The notes were taken during a workers' 
meeting. The first two paragraphs, contain His word-for-word speech. 
After that, the author's notes become approximate, and may have mis¬ 
takes.] 

Calcutta, 1989. "Between two points of no magnitude there is a flow 
of cognition. In that fluidal flow of cognition, bubbles are created. These 
bubbles are bubbles of ideas in the Cosmic emanation of the Supreme. 
When these bubbles touch the unit T feeling, then unit ideas are created 
as a result of close proximity to the Cosmic Ocean. These are the 
reflections or refractions of the Cosmic Idea. When these ideas concern 
the unit, the unit T tries to express them through its own psycho¬ 
physical structure. That endeavor to express its unit desires and 
longings according to the capacity of its vocal cords and its hormonal 
secretion of these reflected or refracted ideas is called 'language.' That 
expression within is called 'inner voice,' and that expression without is 
called 'outer voice.' 

"According to structural, environmental, climatic and racial dif¬ 
ferences, language is expressed in different forms. There we get different 
languages. In the expressed world, linguistic differences have a small 
value. But in the inner world they have no meaning or impact. As far as 
the reflected bubbles are concerned, the language of the universe is the 
same, was the same, and will remain the same forever. The language of 
the inner voice is always one and indivisible." 

Approximately every 2000 years there comes a major change in the 
script of any particular language or set of languages. Though exceptions 
are numerous, approximately every 1000 years the language itself 
undergoes major change. For example, Sanskrit evolved into seven 
different people's languages, and those languages later evolved into 
some of our current languages. Similarly, Latin, Semitic and Vedic 
languages and scripts also evolved. 

There are eight factors which render a language complete. If any of 
these are absent, then it is not a full-fledged language: 1) vocabulary 2) 
pronouns 3) verb endings 4) case endings 5) literature 6) intonation 7) 
psycho-acoustic notes (having psychological effect) 8) syntax. 



Travels with the Mystic Master 


There is a close relationship between the racial factor and language. 
Where sub-races arose, language changed. There are five dominant an¬ 
cient languages: Sanskrit, Vedic, Latin, old Hebrew, and old Chinese. 
Max Mueller (the great philologist) believed that Sanskrit came from 
the Aryans, who entered India from southern Russia and Persia. In fact 
it was the Vedic language which hailed from those areas. Forty percent 
of the Russian and Persian languages derives directly from Vedic. 
Sanskrit, on the other hand, is originally from India. The first Veda, 
which was composed 15,000 years ago was the Rik Veda. It was in 
Vedic, and it was composed by those Aryans still north of India. 5,000 
years later the Atharva Veda was composed in India in Sanskrit. 

Sanskrit language gave birth to seven directions or Prakrita lan¬ 
guages—people's languages. These were: 1) Maghadi Prakrita 2) 
Saorasenii Prakrita 3) Paishachii Prakrita 4) Pashcatya Prakrita 5) 
Pahlavi Prakrita 6) Malavii Prakrita 7) Maharastrii Prakrita. These 
Prakrita languages started 2500 to 3500 years ago. At that time San¬ 
skrit was the linking language. From these seven Prakrita languages, the 
following languages evolved: 

1. Eastern—Maithali, Bengali, Angika, Ashami, Kaosholi 
Western—Bhojpuri, Chatisgari, Magahi, Nagpuri 

2. Harivani, Bhagili, Bumdili, Aradhi, Brajabasa 

3. Dogrii, Punjabi, Mahari Punjabi, Urdu 

4. Tajakii, Ujvekii, Pastu, Kashmirii 

5. Sindi, Multani 

6. Marwari, Gujrati, Kacchi, Malavi, Mevarii, Haraoti 

7. Marathii, Kaunkanii 

Bengali has the highest content of words directly derived from San¬ 
skrit— 92%. Even some non-Indian languages contain a high proportion 
of Sanskrit. Thai is 80% Sanskrit, and Indonesian is 40%. 

The Burmese are a multi-national and multi-lingual people. Among 
the Indo-Burmese are Burmese, Kalciim, Mrtavan, Shan, and Arakan. 
Tamil comes from Dramil, which was further evolved into Northern 
demi and Southern demi. The Northern is Telugu and Southern is 
Kanada. Dravidian is of both Austric and Sanskrit origin. There are four 
derivatives from ancient Chinese: Mandarin, Shanghaiise, new Chinese, 
and Cantonese. Latin divided into three groups: Continental (including 
German), Oriento-demi (including French and Italian), and Occidento- 
demi (including Spanish and Portuguese).

Scandinavian languages were influenced by Latin and Vedic, but 
they were predominantly Nordic. They are the base of the Anglo-Saxon 
group. Polish and the Slavic languages are of Alpine origin. They were 
also influenced by Latin and Vedic. English is a mixture of Latin and 
Anglo-Saxon tongues. 

After the formation of Israel there arose a question of the linking 
language in the Middle East. Would it be modern Hebrew or the other 
Semitic languages? These languages resulted from both Caucasian and 
Negroid influences. 

Most European languages have some parallelism with Vedic, but not 
with Sanskrit. Sanskrit was the people's language until about 3500 years 
ago. From Shiva's time (about 7000 years ago) until Krishna's time 
(about 3500 years ago) the Dravidians, Austrics, Mongolians and Aryans 
were generally united, and throughout India, Sanskrit was spoken. At 
that time most of the Aryans were still in the north. Their language then 
broke into the seven prakrita language groups. 

The first script in the world was Chinese. Later came the Indian 
scripts Brahmi and Kahrosthii. After 2000 years, Brahmi died, and was 
replaced by Sarada in the northwest, Narada in the southwest, and 
Kutiila in the center and in the east. Now almost every state of India has 
its own script. 

Intonation pertains to the duration given to particular vowels. For 
example, the southern portion of the United States has an intonation 
characterized by a drawl. Such differences are primarily due to racial 
and ethnological factors. 

There are three major Mongolian language groups: 1) Indo-Tibetan, 
which is in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India 2) Indo-Burman, 
which is in Burma and east India—it contains more Sanskrit, and 3) 
Sino-Japanese, which is in Japan, China, Taiwan, Mongolia and Korea— 
it has pictorial script. 

African languages differ according to climate and rivers. Language 
there began in the southern portion of the Sahara. As that language 
moved further south it created twenty-seven major languages and dia¬ 
lects. In the northern reaches of the Sahara the main language was 
Egyptian. "Semitic" originally meant north of the Sahara. The Aryans 
and the Blacks met in the area of Palestine, and created the Semitic 
peoples. They are thus a mixture of black and white. The great original 
Egyptian civilization was black. At that time, the Arabs were imposing 
and 



397 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


militant, so they destroyed much of the culture and language of 
Egypt and Persia. Sixty to seventy percent of Persian is Vedic, whereas 
Afghani is mostly Sanskrit. 

One system of classification is according to the changes a language 
undergoes when there is a change in the subject. Thus there are four 
groups: 1) Changes in the conjugation of the verb are affected by both 
the number and the gender of the subject. Example is French. 2 ) 

Changes in the verb are affected only by the number. Examples are 
English and Sanskrit. 3 ) Changes are affected only by the gender. 
Examples are Bhojpuri and Maetili. 4) There is no change either way. 
Examples are Bengali and Dravidian. In number 4 the "to be" verb is 
also not necessary—it is understood. 

/ /. Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout) 

Prout is such a vast concept that a reasonable introduction to it 
requires an entire book. Baba's series Prout in a Nutshell consists of 
over twenty books, and yet, as its title indicates, that the entire series 
provides only fundamental principles and policies with examples. To 
attempt to explain Prout in an appendix is an injustice to the theory. 
Nevertheless, so many references are made to Prout throughout the 
diary that the reader deserves some sort of explanation. 

1) Prout is based on Shri P.R. Sarkar's concept of Neo-humanism, 
which advocates a society concerned not only for human beings, but 
also for animals, plants, and inanimate resources. Neo-humanism 
does not accept narrow groupisms which function as social and psy¬ 
chological causes of exploitation. Such groups condemn and work 
against those who are outside of their own territory, clan, or belief 
system. Exploitative political power groups and selfish economic 
interest groups commonly dominate others through pseudo-culture 
and the mass media. As a result, the life of the entire planet is threat¬ 
ened by massive ecological destruction in the name of progress. 
Education and people's movements should help expose the dogmas 
and superstitions which feed such narrow-mindedness. For this 
purpose, it is also needed to awaken benevolent human conscience 
and the capacity for rational analysis. Ultimately Neo-humanism 
aims at love for one and all, a state which is founded on spiritual 
enlightenment. 



Introduction to Prout

2) There should be maximum utilization , rational distribution and 
proper balance of all physical, mental and spiritual resources. Hence 
the name Progressive Utilization Theory. 

3) At any given time society is dominated bv a specific psychological 
outlook or psychological class . If any class becomes over-entrenched 
in power, it tends to suppress progressive changes. Prout has a sys¬ 
tem of checks and balances which discourages this tendency, and 
encourages a forward shift in power whenever it is needed. 

4) Economic planning should be de-centralized as far as is practical. 
The most important planning is on the lowest level—the block level, 
i.e. an area having about 100,000 people, having similar cultural 
and ecological concerns. Lower levels should be coordinated by 
higher levels, for example, blocks by states, states by regions, and 
regions by nations. Coordination represents concerns of trade, 
transport, communications, etc. The basis of boundaries between 
governing areas should gradually change from historical or political 
bias, to economic, ecological and cultural factors. 

5) All levels of planning should follow certain economic principles 
including the following: 

* Everyone must be guaranteed the purchasing capacity for their 
minimal necessities including food, shelter, clothing, medical care 
and education. 

* Opportunities for employment must be provided to all. 

* There should be a progressive incentive system to encourage ini¬ 
tiative, creativity and labor. Incentives may be given not only in 
the form of money, but also in kind. They may include, for ex¬ 
ample, equipment by which a person can better his performance, 
improved working facilities, household items, or other immenities. 
Incentives may also be provided through special education, new 
job possibilities, increased free time, cultural opportunities, rec¬ 
reational facilities, and so on. 

* There may always be a gap between the minimum and maximum 
economic levels. The economic vitality of a society, however, is 
judged by the speed of improvement in the minimum standard of 
living. In a healthy society, the gap is gradually diminishing. 



399 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


* Improvement in technology is beneficial to mankind when it re¬ 
sults in neither ecological imbalance nor loss of employment. Due 
to improved mechanization, workers should benefit whenever 
possible by diminishment of working hours without loss of salary. 

* Ignoring psychological factors at the working place is harmful to 
both the workers and their output. Therefore a portion of the bud¬ 
get and management time must be allocated to ensure cleanliness, 
safety, equability, ecological care, and an atmosphere which 
encourages initiative and creativity. 

6) These planning principles should be implemented within the 
framework of self-sufficient economic zones . These zones may be 
created by blocks and regions joining together on the basis of 
economic potentiality, ethnic similarity, and environmental features. 
When the local people are directly working for their zone's economic 
well-being and self-sufficiency, then they become highly motivated. 
The local government must plan for a cooperative economy between 
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, commerce and professional ser¬ 
vices. The government will naturally be concerned for maintaining 
long-term fertility of its soil and all-round ecological balance 

7) Such economic zones prefer the development of local resources 
in lieu of exporting raw materials or importing finished products. 
This policy encourages the growth of a healthy indigenous 
manufacturing sector, full employment, and greater security in times 
of difficulty. 

8) Within each zone there should be a three-tiered structure of eco¬ 
nomic enterprises. 

* Cooperatives constitute the largest sector, including all agriculture 
and most industries and commercial companies. They are owned 
and managed by their workers. They should be profitable and 
competitive. 

* Key industries provide essential resources such as minerals, en¬ 
ergy, large scale transport, and communication. They are managed 
as public utilities. Boards of directors are elected democratically, 
and workers participate in management. 



On Tantra, Veda and Yoga 


* Private ventures include small-scale industries, shops and 
services. 

9) Through the inspiration provided by the multifarious incentive sys¬ 
tem, through cooperative ownership, and through economic zonal 
planning, safeguards are created against over-accumulation of 
wealth in which vested interests hoard resources. 

10) Zonal planning should see that villages have sufficient cleanliness, 
natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural and educational facilities so 
that all people, animals and plants will enjoy the process of de¬ 
centralization. Over-populated cities must become a thing of the 
past. 

11) Prout is not a Utopian philosophy . Society is the field for everyone's 
development, and therefore imperfections will always exist. Prout 
recognizes the need for checks and balances on individual power. 
High caliber leadership consists of persons having certain qualities 
such as 

* a reputation for honesty and wisdom 

* a history of community service 

* demonstrated skills in leadership, management and technical 
knowledge. 

Such leaders should be elected democratically. Democracy , however, 
is only successful according to the mentality of the voters. Therefore 
a literate, well-educated and well-informed electorate is essential. 
Accordingly, the influence of the mass media and wealth in politics 
must be regulated. 

12) One of the fundamental works in establishing Prout is to stimu¬ 
late well-intentioned and capable people to participate in the lead¬ 
ership process. It is commonly believed that power corrupts, and 
more power corrupts more. If potential Prout leaders engage them¬ 
selves in intensive social work, healthy living, sacrifice for others, 
relevant technical education, and spiritual practices— then they may 
develop the incorruptible qualities needed in the leaders of a soci¬ 
ety based on coordinated cooperation. 

13) Prout supports the eventual establishment of a representative world 
government . As long as extreme disparity in wealth exists between 
nations, however, world government is impossible. Only when small

countries are free of the threat of domination by big countries will 
global cooperation be possible. Solving global problems depends on 
establishing local economic security. Political freedom without 
economic independence has no value. Hence Prout's policy is eco¬ 
nomic decentralization and centralized political cooperation. 

14) Useful theory is generally only evolved on the basis of practical 
experimentation . Therefore the first steps in expanding the Prout 
theory result from attempts to implement it in communities, such as 
Master Units. As Master Units merge their concerns with the 
surrounding neighborhoods and villages, Prout theory is developed 
and demonstrated. Practical experience is also gained through or¬ 
ganizing public education programs and social movements. Such 
movements support indigenous culture, work for ecological im¬ 
provement, and struggle against psycho-economic exploitation. 

III. Tantra, Veda and Yoga 110 

The many features of Tantra which distinguish it from other spiritual 
traditions make definition difficult within a short space. But if we are to 
focus on the single most characteristic of Tantra's distinguishing 
features, surely that must be the spirit of fight. Baba writes: 

"The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigor. 
It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no 
sa'dhana' [spiritual effort or meditation]. Under such circumstances, 
Tantra cannot be present. It is impossible to conquer a crude idea and 
replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without 
sa 'dhana'. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight." 

Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring 
out, rather than to bury one's problematic mental tendencies. Baba said: 
"A practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a 
hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teaching of the Vedas 
that human beings should move internally and carefully avoid any as¬ 
sociation with their environment." So only if a spiritual path, at least at 
some stage, deliberately seeks out fearful, demoralizing or tempting 


110 M ost of this article was compiled from a book of Baba's speeches on T antra which carries a 
foreword by Dada Vijayananda and Dada Acyutananda. 



On Tantra, Veda and Yoga 


circumstances in order to tight and overcome them by Cosmic ideation 
and by trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called Tantric. Baba 
writes: 

"It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. 
The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The 
external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight, 
both external and internal, is a fight in both ways at once. So practice in 
each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra.... The 
practice for raising the kulakun'd'alinii [psycho-spiritual energy force] 
is the internal sa'dhana 1 of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of 
hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external 
sa'dhana'." 

Both the "internal fight" and the "external fight" refer to the fight 
against internal enemies—but the latter uses external means to intensify 
the fight. He writes: 

"The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground, he is 
stricken with fear.... But when he returns home after finishing sa'dhana', 
the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa'dhana' 
the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and 
slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will 
help the practitioner overcome all instincts." 

Though practices such as that of sa'dhana' in a burial ground may be 
the clearest instances of techniques designed to bring to the surface 
one's mental propensities, such practices are not required of all Tantrics. 
But all Tantrics are brought face to face with their weaknesses in one 
way or other. A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous re¬ 
sponsibilities for social change. The disciples' participation in an activist 
movements aimed at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to 
confront sometimes physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social 
censure and the fear of the overwhelming task before them. The 
inferiority complex is the most debilitating fear which most of us must 
learn to overcome in our lives. Baba writes: 

"Tantra advises: Jump into your environment without the least 
hesitation. Don't be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow 
you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even 
less fearful, and ten days from now you'll notice that you are completely 
fearless."

Tantra, though a singular science, eventually developed into five 
branches: 

1) Shaeva Tantra guides the aspirant to direct all expressions of one's 
life towards the inner world and finally merge into the Supreme 
Knowledge. 

2) Vaeshnaviiya Tantra is a practice of divine love, wherein the aspir¬ 
ant feels that each and every entity of this universe is pervaded by 
God. 

3) Shakta Tantra lays great stress on the attainment of power and its 
judicious application. 

4) Ganapatya Tantra is derived from the custom in ancient times of 
deifying the leader of the tribe. When this practice was converted 
through spiritual outlook it resulted in the cult of viewing the group 
leader as the leader of this universe. 

5) Saora Tantra is derived from worship of the sun as a symbol of the 
nucleus of existence. God is the Supreme Nucleus of the entire 
creation, and all unit beings revolve around Him. Salvation is pos¬ 
sible only when the unit consciousness merges in the Cosmic Con¬ 
sciousness. 

Shri Shri Anandamurti synthesized these five Tantras (Paincha 
Tantra) into a singular system by including the central features of all of 
them. Ananda Marga is a spiritual path where the goal is the attainment 
of Supreme Knowledge (i.e., Shaeva Tantra). To attain this spiritual 
rank we need psychic and spiritual strength (i.e., Shakti) for which 
proper sa'dhana' is required. Our individual meditation, however, is not 
enough to unite our being with the Cosmic Entity. For that we require 
love for everyone; we need to live in joy and peace with the entire 
creation (i.e., we must be Vaeshnavas). When involved with the external 
world it becomes necessary to learn the secrets for introverting the 
extroverted energies so that every experience becomes spiritual and, 
thus, leads towards the Supreme Nucleus (i.e., Saora Tantra). Finally, 
collective life must be systematized, regulated and directed toward God. 
To realize this objective the Ganapati system is used. 

Baba often spoke of having modified Tantra "to suit the needs of the 
modern era." He further elaborated the philosophy of Tantra along lines 
which had previously been little developed. 

In ancient times, Aryan (white-skinned) peoples lived to the north of 
India. The Aryan culture was Vedic. East and south of those Ary 



404 


Travels with the Mystic Master 


ans, the people were non-Aryan, i.e. Mongolian, Dravidian and Austrie. 
The non-Aryan culture was Tantric. In a long article titled Tantra and 
Indo-Aryan Civilization, Baba explains much about Tantra, as well as its 
relation to Veda. He also slightly refers to yoga. Extracts of that article 
follow: 

Usually the non-Aryans were content with little. What was developed in 
them was their introspective nature, which not only made them devotees 
of God, but infused in them a surging love for spiritual philosophy. The 
religious practices of the Aryans, however, entailed performing certain 
sacrifices in order to attain certain materialistic gains. That is, their 
religious observances were mainly ritualistic. On the whole, the non- 
Aryans were followers of Tantra, or subjective [i.e., introspective] 
sa'dhana'. Of course the non-Aryans, depending on their different 
degrees of intellectual development, ranged all the way from ani-mists 
to Brahma sa'dhakas [intuitional practitioners whose goal is the 
Absolute]; but in general, individual sa'dhana' ranked very high. The 
religion of the Vedic Aryans was, as a rule, one of prayer. It did not 
include even the subtlest hint of any intuitional meditation. And here 
lies the difference between the Brahmavada [theory of the Infinite En¬ 
tity] of the Vedas and the Upanishads on the one hand, and that of 
Tantra on the other. 

As previously mentioned, by "non-Aryans" no particular ethnic 
group was meant. When the Aryans first migrated to India, the non- 
Aryans were, on the whole, divided into three populations. Of these, the 
Negro-Austric Dravidians were the most developed intellectually and 
spiritually. Their Tantra sa'dhana' bore a predominance of jina'na 
[knowledge] and bhakti [devotion]. The next groups deserving mention 
are those of the Mongolian population. In their Tantra sa'dhana', karma 
[service] and bhakti [devotion] were predominant. The groups which 
constituted the Austrie population were almost equal to the Aryans 
intellectually, but in the practical and spiritual spheres they gradually 
lagged behind due to the comparative lack of dynamism of their society. 
This Austrie society was content to practice the extrover-sial aspects of 
Tantra (witchcraft, invultuation, magic, magical incantation for evil 
purposes, hypnotism, etc.). 

Tantra flourished in Bengal due to the pervasive intermixture of 
Dravidian and Mongolian blood.... 



On Tantra, Veda and Yoga 


405 


In the life of Bengal, Tantra has surrendered to Veda only with re¬ 
spect to language. In fact there was no alternative but to acknowledge 
this defeat: The Bengalis of those days were followers of Tantra who 
spoke many different languages. When they decided to formulate a new 
language of their own, they were bound to accept the language of the 
foreign Aryans due to its highly expressive power. The Dravidian and 
Mongolian languages [although also a related to Sanskrit] were not so 
expressive as the Sanskrit language of the Vedas.... Due to the Vedic 
influence, particularly due to the influence of the eastern Vedic dialect, 
Ma'gadhii Prakrta, there emerged a Sanskrit-based Aryan language in 
Bengal. Later on, the Tantrics of this area composed Tantric literature 
using Sanskrit and the new Sanskrit-based Bengali.... 

Spiritual practice was common in the Tantric society. There is no 
spiritual vigor whatsoever in the lives of those who support pompous, 
so-called religious ceremonies, as there is in the lives of introspective 
spiritual practitioners. After the Aryans came into India, two types of 
practice used to take place side by side: on the one side the sacrificial 
fires of the rs'is [religious leaders], characterized by the smell of burning 
ghee [purified butter] and the sonorous refrains of those paying homage 
to the manes while offering oblations into the fire; and on the other side, 
the non-Aryans' Tantra sa'dhana', the practice of self-control and 
attainment of divine power. Spiritual depth and power of sa'dhana' 
brought fearlessness into the spiritual lives of the non-Aryans, as befit¬ 
ting staunch Tantrics.... 

Here it is necessary to remember that Tantra is not a religion, but a 
way of life, a system of sa'dhana. The fundamental goal of this 
sa'dhana'is to awaken the dormant jiivashakti [unit force], known as 
kulakun'd'alinii, and, after elevating it stage by stage, to merge it in 
Brahmabha'va [Cosmic Consciousness]. Tantra is a science of spiritual 
meditation or sa'dhana' which is equally applicable to anyone no matter 
what their religious affiliation might be. Tantra is certainly older than 
the Vedas. 111 Just as the shlokas or mantras of the Vedas were handed 
down from guru to disciple in a genealogical tradition, the Tantra sa'dhana' of 
the Mongolo-Dravidian society was handed down from guru to disciple 
hereditarily. The Vedas are theoretical—full of ritualistic ceremo 


m The first Veda, theRgveda, is dated 15,000 years ago. 



406 


Travels wiIth the Mystic Master 


nies and formalisms. It would be incorrect to regard Tantra as a more 
recent version of those Vedic rituals: Tantra's esoteric practices had long 
been known in the society of sa'dhakas [spiritual aspirants]. Its 
theoretical portion was not as elaborate as that of the Vedas, which took 
years and years to memorize. 

When the Aryans came to India, roughly during the period of the 
Artharvaveda, they learned Tantra sa'dhana' to some extent after 
coming in contact with the Indian Tantrics. This resulted in the 
Artharvaveda being pervasively influenced by Tantra. Even if the 
orthodox Vedics try to reject the many Tantra-influenced portions of the 
Vedas as later interpolations, they will not be too convincing, for Tantra 
has now infiltrated into the marrow of the so-called Aryans. Although 
during the post-Vedic Buddhist era as well as the post-Buddhist 
Brahmanical era changes in the religious outlook of the people were 
apparent, the process of sa'dhana' remained Tantric as it does even 
today, for without Tantra, spiritual sa'dhana' is impossible. 

Yoga, which is the paramount factor in spiritual practices, is itself 
based on Tantra. The great Tantric Vashis't'ha, when he returned from 
China after learning the Chinese techniques of sa'dhana', brought about 
a great improvement in Tantra sa'dhana'. He was widely acclaimed as a 
great yogi. His book Yogava'shis't'ha is a philosophical exposition of the 
subtle spirituality of Tantra sa'dhana'. 

Momentarily diverting from Baba's article, it may be observed that 
yoga is thus a part of Tantra, indeed the subtlest aspect of the Tantric 
practice. Shiva Himself elucidated yoga, as did a number of the Tantra 
scriptures. Three of the other foremost authorities on yoga were also 
Tantrics: Krishna, Vashistha, and Patanjali. 

Patanjali was the last of the line, having lived only about 2000 years 
ago. Though Baba generally agrees with Patanjali, He differs on a few 
points. Most fundamental of these concern the very definition of yoga. 
Patanjali wrote: Yogash citta vrtii nirodha. This means "To suspend the 
function of thinking is Yoga." Baba explained that it is the nature of 
mind to think. So it is unnatural to try to stop that thinking process. 
Such an effort amounts to suppression, and therefore may be harmful. 

On the other hand, Baba quotes and supports a definition directly 
from the Tantras: Sam'yogo yogo ityukto jiiva'tma' Parama'tmanah. 



On Tantra, Veda and Yoga 


407 


This means "The union of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul is 
yoga." This process is founded on a natural attraction toward infinite 
bliss or infinite love. As one develops love for God, simultaneously love 
for all of the creation is generated. The result is creative and expansive. 
Upon the ultimate merging of the individual mind with the Cosmic 
Mind, the individual thought process automatically ceases, as there is 
no longer any separate individual. Such a person is aware only of God, 
and no ego remains. 

One of the major etymological interpretations of Tantra also parallels 
this definition of yoga. Tan means to expand, and tra means to liberate. 
Thus Tantra means to become liberated from all sorts of bondage 
through theexpansion of one's self. We should clearly understand that 
yoga is a process of expansion, not contraction or suppression. 

Turning back to Baba's article: 

There are many who try to make a distinction between Hindu Tantra 
and Buddhist Tantra. This is absolutely wrong, for as I have said earlier, 
Tantra is one and only one. It is based on one sentiment, on one idea. 
The Buddhist and Hindu Tantras express the same thing in different 
words. 112 

After the Aryan settlement in India a great man was born into the 
non-Aryan society. Born into a Mongolo-Aryan family, this great man 
had a high nose and fair complexion. He was a great Tantric—a great 
yogi. The name of this M aha'purus'a [Great Personl of the non-Aryan 
society was Shiva. For one man to have so many qualities and endow¬ 
ments at the same time was beyond the comprehension of the people, so 
He was called Gun'a'tiita or Nirgun'a Purus'a [the Transcendental 


112 On this point of the identity between theseT antras (except in their terminology), Baba gives 
several pages of examples. 

All spiritual and religious systems are adaptable to Tantra, though some systems are better than 
others, as explained in the following saying from the Kuia'rn'ava Tantra: 

Uttamo Brahmasadbha'vo 
Madhyama' dhya'na dha'ran'a) 

J apastu'ti sya'dhadhama' 

Mu'rtipu'ja' dhama'dhama' 

This means: Ideation on Brahma or God is the best, meditation and concentration are second 
best, repetitious incantation and eulogistic prayer are the worst, and idol worship is the worst of 
the worst.

or Non-Attributional Person]. As the result of His Tantra sa'dhana' He 
attained extraordinary powers, which He employed for the good of 
humanity. It was He who systematized the science of Tantra and thus He 
was the guru or the father of Tantrics and yogis. To this Self-realized 
M aha'purus'a there was no distinction of high and low. People of all 
classes, from the highest to the lowest, were dear to Him. Irrespective of 
class—Aryan, non-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric or Mongolian—all flocked 
to Him. He showered His grace on them all equally. As the battles raged 
between the "gods" on the one hand and the "demons" and "monsters" 
on the other (needless to say, "gods" meant the handsome Aryan leaders, 
and "demons" and "monsters" meant the non-Aryans in general), the 
non-Aryan "demons" and "monsters" became more and more powerful 
through the blessings of this Shiva. All the ra'ks'asas and asuras 
[demons and monsters] were Shiva's obedient devotees and followers. 
With the help and blessings of Shiva they destroyed the might and power 
of the "gods." According to Sanskrit stories, when the gods would seek 
the help of Brahma' and Vis'riu, even those two would not dare to 
oppose Shiva; rather they would save the gods through a compromise 
with Him. 

Shiva had such a forgiving nature, born out of His spirit of benevo¬ 
lence, that even the most wicked could easily draw on His kindness. That 
is why to everybody He became A 'shutos'a (Easy to Please). Due to 
Shiva's pervasive influence over their society, the non-Aryans, that is, 
the Tantrics, used to worship Him as God, and according to their 
respective intellectual strata they regarded and accepted Him in His 
different bearings. Just as the Aryans began to identify Shiva with their 
own gods and goddesses, the kaola maha'ta'ntrikas [great Tantrics in 
the tradition of kulakun'd'alinii yoga] began to regard Shiva as identical 
with Nirgun'a Brahma [unqualified Supreme Consciousness]. The 
foremost cause behind this conception of theirs was the absolute de¬ 
tachment and self-forgetful bearing of Shiva, the lord of supernatural 
and miraculous power. Shiva's self-sacrificing nature earned Him the 
name Bhola'na'tha [one absolutely indifferent to his own status] among 
the non-Aryans. All were attracted to Shiva's supernatural power, His 
imposing personality, His limitless qualities and the calm, tranquil ra¬ 
diance of His features.... 



On Tantra, Veda and Yoga 


409 


Shiva's influence over the Aryans increased more and more. The Aryans 
began to feel that, being so indebted to Shiva, they could no longer 
afford to disregard Him. It was Shiva who had taught them spiritual 
sa'dhana, asanas and pra'n'a'ya'ma [meditation, yoga postures and 
breath control]; the secret of good health; the science of medicine; and 
the developed art of dance and music. For His excellence in dancing, 
both the Aryans and non-Aryans used to call Him Nat'ara'ja, and for 
His proficiency in vocal music, Na'datanu. No one has counted the 
number of medicines He invented for every kind of disease. He was the 
first preceptor of the a'yurveda'ca'ryas [teachers of a'yurveda, the 
science of medicine to increase longevity]. The asuras [Mongolians] 
were cured of many serious diseases due to His grace. Both the Aryans 
and the non-Aryans thought that since Shiva knew so many remedies, 

He was perhaps immortal, and so they named Him Mrtyuinjaya 
[conqueror of death].... 

The present social system of India (which is fundamentally Tantric) 
was developed by Shiva. 113 After accepting Shiva as God without any 
reservation, the Aryans appropriated everything good of the Dravidians 
and the other non-Aryans. Of course this did not diminish the Aryans' 
prestige—rather it enhanced it.... 

Not only in India, but in quite a large part of the world, in every 
sphere of life, the laws and injunctions of Shiva alone prevailed for a 
long time. Even today the civilization of modern India is intrinsically 
Tantric. On the outside only is there a Vedic stamp. Or if we take the 
Indian civilization as an enameled ornament, then its gold is Tantric, 
and the enamel Vedic.... 

When the Indians were about to forget the teachings of Shiva due to 
their fascination with the mundane objectivities of the world, there came 
another sublime entity like Shiva, who reminded them of those 
teachings. That great personality was Shri Krs'n'a [Krishna]. The ques¬ 
tion as to which of the two was greater, Krs'n'a or Shiva, does not arise, 
because all knowers of Brahma are one: all are Brahma. 


113 Shiva was the first guru to loudly proclaim that men and women are spiritually equal. He 
initiated Hisdaughter and Histhree wives, who all became famous yoginis. He also was the first 
to introduce the system of marriage in order to bind together father, mother and children.
