## The history of the Arab and M oslem movement throughout the world 

Valencia, Spain, 1979. Culturally and historically, Iberia was not a part of the Roman empire. The creation of the Moors' society was a reaction to the western part of the Arab movement. 

The northern  portion of Saudi Arabia up to the northern part of Palestine was Arabia. They were nomads and heathens -- they had no faith in God. They were intellectually backward. 

But they were highly developed in astronomy, astrophysics, algebra and math because the land was desert and they needed to learn to follow the stars.

Around 1,400 years ago they became Moslem, and gave up the Semitic culture. 

Originally the Arabs and Jews were one culture. 

The Arabs were heathens, whereas the Jews knew a little of God. 

Some of the Arabs became Christian 2000 years ago. 1369 years ago they became Moslems.

They expelled the Jews from Palestine and adjacent places. The Jews became homeless, transported to different countries like Great Britain and the Soviet Union. 

After occupying all of Palestine, the Arabs spread to the north, to Yugoslavia. In the east they stretched out to the Philippines in southeast 
Asia. 

In the south past Ceylon to the Maldives Islands. To the west they  came to the Atlantic, crossed northern Africa, the Sahara, Egypt, Sudan, Tripoli, Tunisia and Morocco. 

They destroyed the original Egyptian culture. Those were the Egyptians who knew the science of the preservation of dead bodies. The present Egyptians are not the descendants of those ancient Egyptians. Rather they are a transplanted Arab population. 

After the western march they commenced an eastern march. 75% of that eastern march was stopped in India. That is why it resorted to waterways through islands up to the Philippines. The march could not go to China and Japan. It was checked forever. When the Spanish occupied the Philippines they stopped the Arabs. 

In the southern march they could not go past the Maldives Islands. In the 
northern march they proceeded up to Yugoslavia. There the movement stopped due to extreme cold climate, where they could not show bravery 
and valor. Similarly the Germans were defeated when they attacked the Russians in the winter. 

In the west the Atlantic Ocean stopped the Arab march. From Morocco they went north through Gibraltar to invade Iberia. They wanted to move to the Bay of Basque.

But it was difficult to cross the Pyrenees Mountains. They could not occupy Portugal because the Arab navy was very weak. The Portuguese were strong. 

The people of Iberia had to fight by tooth and nail. The Arabs who came from Morocco were known as Moors. The western march stopped after reaching Spain. 
Islam was restricted to these boundaries of the world.

You will have to preach Ananda Marga southward of Gibraltar-just the opposite course of the Arabs. But you will not preach through the sword. Your message will be spread through love and social service. Love is a stronger weapon than the sword. 

Here there are left only a few certain marks of the Arabs in the cultural life. Otherwise the Arab presence is no longer here. Now they are as dead as the dodo. 

The dodos were a pigeon group which came to certain islands in the Arabian Sea where there were no humans present to kill them. Therefore they lost their capacity to fly.

Their bodies  became bulky, as they had no need for self-defense. When people from  other countries finally went there, they caught ready meat just with their 
bare hands. The last dodo died about too years ago. Anything which is fully dead is now called in people's English dead as the dodo. 

## The post-Moor culture in Spain

What was the influence of the Moors on Spain?

The main population of Iberia is Caucasian of Mediterranean offshoot, with close proximity to the Italians and southern French. Their color is 
white—not reddish-white like the Germans. Their hair is black, not gray-black like the Germans. The brownish-black skin and hair is from the 
Moors. And you will hardly find such a man today in Spain. In the anthropological life of Spain, there is little influence of the Arabs. But in 
the language there remain a few distorted Arabian words. 

Finally the original land of the Moors was occupied by the French. It became a colony. 

Strengthen yourselves in north Africa. We will attack from Spain with love. But we shall say to them we are not your born enemies. They may 
say, 'We hate you.' We will say, 'We love you.' 


## Increasing agricultural production 

Calcutta, 1988. To take care of the security and welfare of the people of any developing country, the production level should be increased. 

Bangladesh imports much of what it needs because in many areas only one or two crops are grown per year. Most crops should be harvested 3-4 times per year in poor countries. 

Poor countries are usually densely populated, thus every inch of land must be used judiciously. 

Mixed farming is required. Staple crops especially must be produced 4 times per year. The priorities are: 

1. Cereals
2. Oil-producing seeds and pulses 
3. Vegetables

Where there is little rain, seeds should first be planted for 6 weeks in a small field for ease of watering. Then the seedlings should be transplanted for another 80 or 85 days in large fields. If any crop yield takes as long as four months then there must be a subsidiary crop such as oil 
seeds. In the same field both cereals and oil-seeds may be grown. 

This is  an example of mixed farming. Between the deep-rooted plants, put the 
short-rooted oil-seed plants—or other short-rooted plants like cloves, turmeric or ginger. In that case manure will not be needed because oilseeds add needed natural elements to the land, so that it becomes fertile. 

Chemical fertilizers decrease the inter-molecular space in the soil. If you use chemicals sometimes, you must always use them. But vegetable and 
animal fertilizers cause no bad reaction. 

Pumping water from below the earth's surface is not good for irrigation because the water table will go down. A three inches drop in the 
water table per too years is normal. When pumping is done, it will increase to about six inches per too years. The Calcutta area is one of the worst—it is now sinking eight inches every too years due to  intense water pumping. The perennial rivers offer the best source for 
irrigation. 

Where the saline water-level is too high, it is better to pipe in sweetwater, even if it must be done from too miles away. When farming is 
done with sweet-water for 5-10 years, the saline level will decrease and become normal. 

Normally potatoes take 90 days to mature. But in 60 days it is also possible to harvest the potatoes and make dehydrated potato powder. 
Otherwise it cannot easily be preserved. Only 90-day potatoes can be kept a long time in cold storage. 

Rivers coming from dead mountains do not carry soil. They carry sand. In sandy areas it is best to take away three feet of the sandy soil, 
put a layer of polythene plastic, and put the sandy soil back. 

Then water  and manure will not sink away so easily. This is an example of an idea  with which Baba personally experimented. In the desert there is only 
sand without even soil, so lime must be added. 

When land is very dry, then non-mulberry silk-worms can be produced. When the cocoons are put into water, they yield fiber for silk 
threads. In two or three months, too silk-worms increase to 20,000. 
Also wool-sheep can be maintained wherever there are high hills. 

Nature has given all different types of soil, and in each place something important grows. We can also create new plants for the desert and 
other areas of low fertility. 


## Grassroots planning 

The best planning is not done only by the high level bosses but also 
by the volunteers on the lowest local level. Then only can that planning 
be realistic. For that reason, Baba gave the slogan for all Margi district 
in-charges: "Know the area, prepare the plan, serve the people." District 
in-charges coming from any part of the world were tested by Baba on 
the following items relating to their own districts: 

1. topography or natural environment, plus temperature, flora 
and fauna 

2. agricultural potentialities 

3. industrial potentialities 

4. nature of soil 

5. availability of natural resources 

6. rivers and valleys 

7. block-level planning covering all aspects of social life 

8. how to develop the language 

9. participation of indigenous peoples in agricultural and industry 

10. rainfall 

11. soil erosion 

12. landscape 

13. farming in arid lands, coastal belt (saline problems) 

14. sources of energy 

15. type of irrigation prominent and possible 

16. name and meaning of their own people's movement 

17. international and state river links 

18. classical language from which local language originated 

19. scope for auxiliary agriculture (fisheries, beekeeping, poultry, 
dairy farms, horticulture, orchards) 

20. scope for setting up machine tool stations 

21. technique of farming according to nature of land, e.g. plain land, 
highland, lowland, arid land, saline zone, mountain zone 

22. ecological balance 

23. scope for encouraging reforestation and discouraging 
deforestation. 


On solving Bangladesh's economic problems 

[From the author's notes of Baba's talk during a workers' meeting:] 

Calcutta, 1989. Baba explained how Bangladesh, one of the world's 
poorest nations, can solve its problems: 

First analyze the country's raw materials. It sells untanned hide and 
raw jute (fiber for rough cloth) in the international market. It has vir¬ 
tually no metallic materials and very little underground fuel such as raw 
gas. The best system for such a country is barter trade. 

If Bangladesh were to process the hide and jute itself would its 
economy improve? These processes are complicated and costly, so it 
would not be useful. Also, synthetics are rapidly replacing both raw 
materials. The jute industry is a sick industry because it cannot easily 
compete. Many producers have closed, and the government has been forced to subsidize the industry. Thailand also produces jute, but its jute 
is superior. And Thailand is not an underdeveloped nation. Previously 
England processed Indian jute in England itself. After Indian inde¬ 
pendence in 1947, England could no longer purchase jute from India, so 
they created synthetics. It is clear that Bangladesh must change its 
industry. 

Japan is importing raw materials from around the world. If those 
countries become politically conscious, they will stop exporting to Ja¬ 
pan. This will happen in the near future. Orissa is exporting manganese 
and iron ore to Japan, but they will soon stop. 

Suppose Bangladesh stops jute, and increases rice production. Rice 
can be easily grown there. Will that solve their problem? In that case, 
Bangladesh will become self-sufficient in food, but will not have any 
basis for international commercial transaction, which will deprive it of 
many basic needs. 

What is the way out? Some advocate that jute should be mixed with 
artificial materials and wool. Also the jute stem can be used to make 
nylon. These approaches are still only the best of a bad lot. From the end 
of winter to the end of the rainy season is the time for growing jute. Can 
anything else be grown then? Only sesame, perhaps linseed also, which 
has a big international market and can also be used to make petroleum. 
But this is not the immediate solution. Jute must continue in the short 
term, but only that amount which is needed for local industries. Raw 
jute should not be exported. Only finished products should be exported. 

To solve the problem, developmental projects should be initiated 
which are based on the availability of local materials. Some propose the 
widespread establishment of coconut plantations. The salinity of the soil 
in Dacca is insufficient. But palmira or tal (palm) can be grown. Coconut 
grows nicely in Nokali district. Plastic can be manufactured from the 
husk. Jessore and its adjacent areas are also good for coconut. 

As to natural resources, there are hardly any raw minerals available. 
Non-ferrous industries can be developed. There is some gas and oil 
available, but not much. From where should the power come? Hydro¬ 
electricity is not possible because rivers are in the delta stage. They must 
be in the hilly stage, and must have sufficient force. To avoid flooding, they should have many dikes like Holland, and fully utilize the 
water. The very wide rivers we see now are due to deforestation and the 
stripping away of vines. So large banks must be constructed, and 
massive reforestation done. For now, power can be derived from ocean 
tides and from solar energy. Ocean tide energy is tapped where rivers 
enter the ocean. It is cheap and efficient. Solar power facilities are not 
yet sufficiently developed, but will become more efficient soon. There is 
not much possibility to obtain thermal power—the coal is too young. It 
needs another 800,000 to one million years. But at that point human 
beings will no longer live on this planet. Bio-gas production will help 
solve the problem of manure, which is also a chronic problem. 

Horticulture is also good. (He gave many details concerning beans, 
jackfruit, mango, etc.) Crops of the tropical zones are good. Temperate 
zone crops are not suitable. The quantity of fish has decreased because 
there is insufficient rotting materials due to deforestation. Before there 
was about 2400 square kilometers of forest, but now it is less than 1000 
square kilometers. (Perhaps I misunderstood Him on these figures.) 
Bangladesh needs large-scale reforestation and preserves. Pineapples 
need 60 inches of rainfall per year. The average in Bangladesh is 80 
inches except in one region. Pineapples give food and also material for 
making cloth. Litchis and silk are both good. Cotton is not suitable. 
Mulberry wood is good for producing sporting goods and also rayon. If 
mulberry wood is hardened, it becomes hard as iron, and can be used in 
construction. There can be production of banana chips, dried fruits and 
washing soap. By burning banana leaves enough sodium bicarbonate 
can be manufactured to serve the world. 

Just to distract the unsophisticated population from the govern¬ 
ment's lack of proper planning, the government excites the people 
through non-issues, like declaring Bangladesh a Muslim state. This was 
happened at the time of the epic flooding. 

Proper planning will not become a reality until the voters are edu¬ 
cated. Even if they do not become politically educated, at least they 
should become politically conscious. 


## The evolution of languages throughout the world 

Calcutta, 1989. "Between 2 points of no magnitude there is a flow of cognition [aether]. In that fluidal flow of cognition, **bubbles are created**. 

**These bubbles are bubbles of ideas in the Cosmic emanation of the Supreme.** 

When these bubbles touch the unit I feeling, then unit ideas are created as a result of close proximity to the Cosmic Ocean. 

These are the  reflections or refractions of the Cosmic Idea. When these ideas concern the unit, the unit I tries to express them through its own psychophysical structure.

That endeavor to express its unit desires and longings according to the capacity of its vocal cords and its hormonal secretion of these reflected or refracted ideas is called 'language.' 

That expression within is called 'inner voice,' and that expression without is  called 'outer voice.' 

According to structural, environmental, climatic and racial differences, language is expressed in different forms. There we get different 
languages. In the expressed world, linguistic differences have a small value. But in the inner world they have no meaning or impact. As far as 
the reflected bubbles are concerned, the language of the universe is the same, was the same, and will remain the same forever. The language of 
the inner voice is always one and indivisible.

Approximately every 2000 years there comes a major change in the script of any particular language or set of languages. Though exceptions 
are numerous, approximately every 1000 years the language itself undergoes major change. For example, Sanskrit evolved into seven 
different people's languages, and those languages later evolved into some of our current languages. Similarly, Latin, Semitic and Vedic 
languages and scripts also evolved. 

### 8 Factors which Complete a Language

If any of  these are absent, then it is not a full-fledged language: 

1. Vocabulary
2. Pronouns
3. Verb endings 
4. Case endings
5. Literature 
6. Intonation 
7. Psycho-acoustic notes (having psychological effect) 
8. Syntax


There is a close relationship between the racial factor and language. 

Where sub-races arose, language changed. There are 5 dominant ancient languages: 

1. Sanskrit
2. Vedic
3. Latin
4. old Hebrew
5. old Chinese. 

Max Mueller (the great philologist) believed that Sanskrit came from  the Aryans. In fact, it was the Vedic language which hailed from those areas. 

40% of the Russian and Persian languages derives directly from Vedic.

Sanskrit, on the other hand, is originally from India. The first Veda,  which was composed 15,000 years ago was the Rik Veda. It was in 
Vedic, and it was composed by those Aryans still north of India. 5,000 years later the Atharva Veda was composed in India in Sanskrit. 

Sanskrit language gave birth to 7 directions or Prakrita languages—people's languages:

1. Maghadi Prakrita 
2. Saorasenii Prakrita 
3. Paishachii Prakrita 
4. Pashcatya Prakrita 
5. Pahlavi Prakrita 
6. Malavii Prakrita 
7. Maharastrii Prakrita

These  Prakrita languages started 2500 to 3500 years ago. At that time Sanskrit was the linking language. From these seven Prakrita languages, the 
following languages evolved: 

1. Eastern—Maithali, Bengali, Angika, Ashami, Kaosholi 
Western—Bhojpuri, Chatisgari, Magahi, Nagpuri 

2. Harivani, Bhagili, Bumdili, Aradhi, Brajabasa 

3. Dogrii, Punjabi, Mahari Punjabi, Urdu 

4. Tajakii, Ujvekii, Pastu, Kashmirii 

5. Sindi, Multani 

6. Marwari, Gujrati, Kacchi, Malavi, Mevarii, Haraoti 

7. Marathii, Kaunkanii 

Bengali has the highest content of words directly derived from Sanskrit— 92%. Even some non-Indian languages contain a high proportion of Sanskrit. Thai is 80% Sanskrit, and Indonesian is 40%.

The Burmese are a multi-national and multi-lingual people. Among  the Indo-Burmese are Burmese, Kalciim, Mrtavan, Shan, and Arakan. 
Tamil comes from Dramil, which was further evolved into Northern demi and Southern demi. The Northern is Telugu and Southern is 
Kanada. Dravidian is of both Austric and Sanskrit origin. 

There are 4 derivatives from ancient Chinese:

1. Mandarin
2. Shanghaiise
3. new Chinese, 
4. Cantonese

Latin is divided into:

1. Continental (including German)
2. Oriento-demi (including French and Italian)
3. Occidento-demi (including Spanish and Portuguese). 


Scandinavian languages were influenced by Latin and Vedic, but they were predominantly Nordic. They are the base of the Anglo-Saxon 
group. Polish and the Slavic languages are of Alpine origin. 

They were  also influenced by Latin and Vedic. English is a mixture of Latin and  Anglo-Saxon tongues. 

After the formation of Israel there arose a question of the linking language in the Middle East. Would it be modern Hebrew or the other 
Semitic languages? These languages resulted from both Caucasian and  Negroid influences. 

Most European languages have some parallelism with Vedic, but not with Sanskrit. Sanskrit was the people's language until about 3500 years 
ago. From Shiva's time (about 7000 years ago) until Krishna's time (about 3500 years ago) the Dravidians, Austrics, Mongolians and Aryans 
were generally united, and throughout India, Sanskrit was spoken. At 
that time most of the Aryans were still in the north. Their language then 
broke into the seven prakrita language groups. 

The first script in the world was Chinese. Later came the Indian 
scripts Brahmi and Kahrosthii. After 2000 years, Brahmi died, and was 
replaced by Sarada in the northwest, Narada in the southwest, and 
Kutiila in the center and in the east. Now almost every state of India has 
its own script. 

Intonation pertains to the duration given to particular vowels. For 
example, the southern portion of the United States has an intonation 
characterized by a drawl. Such differences are primarily due to racial 
and ethnological factors. 

There are three major Mongolian language groups: 1) Indo-Tibetan, 
which is in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India 2) Indo-Burman, 
which is in Burma and east India—it contains more Sanskrit, and 3) 
Sino-Japanese, which is in Japan, China, Taiwan, Mongolia and Korea— 
it has pictorial script. 

African languages differ according to climate and rivers. Language 
there began in the southern portion of the Sahara. As that language 
moved further south it created twenty-seven major languages and dia¬ 
lects. In the northern reaches of the Sahara the main language was 
Egyptian. "Semitic" originally meant north of the Sahara. The Aryans 
and the Blacks met in the area of Palestine, and created the Semitic 
peoples. They are thus a mixture of black and white. The great original 
Egyptian civilization was black. At that time, the Arabs were imposing 
and militant, so they destroyed much of the culture and language of 
Egypt and Persia. Sixty to seventy percent of Persian is Vedic, whereas 
Afghani is mostly Sanskrit. 

One system of classification is according to the changes a language 
undergoes when there is a change in the subject. Thus there are four 
groups: 1) Changes in the conjugation of the verb are affected by both 
the number and the gender of the subject. Example is French. 2 ) 

Changes in the verb are affected only by the number. Examples are 
English and Sanskrit. 3 ) Changes are affected only by the gender. 
Examples are Bhojpuri and Maetili. 4) There is no change either way. 
Examples are Bengali and Dravidian. In number 4 the "to be" verb is 
also not necessary—it is understood.
