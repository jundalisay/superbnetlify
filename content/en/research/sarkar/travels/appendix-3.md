III. Tantra, Veda and Yoga 110 

The many features of Tantra which distinguish it from other spiritual 
traditions make definition difficult within a short space. But if we are to 
focus on the single most characteristic of Tantra's distinguishing 
features, surely that must be the spirit of fight. Baba writes: 

"The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigor. 
It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no 
sa'dhana' [spiritual effort or meditation]. Under such circumstances, 
Tantra cannot be present. It is impossible to conquer a crude idea and 
replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without 
sa 'dhana'. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight." 

Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring 
out, rather than to bury one's problematic mental tendencies. Baba said: 
"A practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a 
hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teaching of the Vedas 
that human beings should move internally and carefully avoid any as¬ 
sociation with their environment." So only if a spiritual path, at least at 
some stage, deliberately seeks out fearful, demoralizing or tempting

circumstances in order to tight and overcome them by Cosmic ideation 
and by trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called Tantric. Baba 
writes: 

"It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. 
The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The 
external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight, 
both external and internal, is a fight in both ways at once. So practice in 
each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra.... The 
practice for raising the kulakun'd'alinii [psycho-spiritual energy force] 
is the internal sa'dhana 1 of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of 
hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external 
sa'dhana'." 

Both the "internal fight" and the "external fight" refer to the fight 
against internal enemies—but the latter uses external means to intensify 
the fight. He writes: 

"The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground, he is 
stricken with fear.... But when he returns home after finishing sa'dhana', 
the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa'dhana' 
the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and 
slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will 
help the practitioner overcome all instincts." 

Though practices such as that of sa'dhana' in a burial ground may be 
the clearest instances of techniques designed to bring to the surface 
one's mental propensities, such practices are not required of all Tantrics. 
But all Tantrics are brought face to face with their weaknesses in one 
way or other. A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous re¬ 
sponsibilities for social change. The disciples' participation in an activist 
movements aimed at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to 
confront sometimes physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social 
censure and the fear of the overwhelming task before them. The 
inferiority complex is the most debilitating fear which most of us must 
learn to overcome in our lives. Baba writes: 

"Tantra advises: Jump into your environment without the least 
hesitation. Don't be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow 
you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even 
less fearful, and ten days from now you'll notice that you are completely 
fearless." 



Tantra, though a singular science, eventually developed into five 
branches: 

1) Shaeva Tantra guides the aspirant to direct all expressions of one's 
life towards the inner world and finally merge into the Supreme 
Knowledge. 

2) Vaeshnaviiya Tantra is a practice of divine love, wherein the aspir¬ 
ant feels that each and every entity of this universe is pervaded by 
God. 

3) Shakta Tantra lays great stress on the attainment of power and its 
judicious application. 

4) Ganapatya Tantra is derived from the custom in ancient times of 
deifying the leader of the tribe. When this practice was converted 
through spiritual outlook it resulted in the cult of viewing the group 
leader as the leader of this universe. 

5) Saora Tantra is derived from worship of the sun as a symbol of the 
nucleus of existence. God is the Supreme Nucleus of the entire 
creation, and all unit beings revolve around Him. Salvation is pos¬ 
sible only when the unit consciousness merges in the Cosmic Con¬ 
sciousness. 

Shri Shri Anandamurti synthesized these five Tantras (Paincha 
Tantra) into a singular system by including the central features of all of 
them. Ananda Marga is a spiritual path where the goal is the attainment 
of Supreme Knowledge (i.e., Shaeva Tantra). To attain this spiritual 
rank we need psychic and spiritual strength (i.e., Shakti) for which 
proper sa'dhana' is required. Our individual meditation, however, is not 
enough to unite our being with the Cosmic Entity. For that we require 
love for everyone; we need to live in joy and peace with the entire 
creation (i.e., we must be Vaeshnavas). When involved with the external 
world it becomes necessary to learn the secrets for introverting the 
extroverted energies so that every experience becomes spiritual and, 
thus, leads towards the Supreme Nucleus (i.e., Saora Tantra). Finally, 
collective life must be systematized, regulated and directed toward God. 
To realize this objective the Ganapati system is used. 

Baba often spoke of having modified Tantra "to suit the needs of the 
modern era." He further elaborated the philosophy of Tantra along lines 
which had previously been little developed. 

In ancient times, Aryan (white-skinned) peoples lived to the north of 
India. The Aryan culture was Vedic. East and south of those Aryans, the people were non-Aryan, i.e. Mongolian, Dravidian and Austrie. 
The non-Aryan culture was Tantric. In a long article titled Tantra and 
Indo-Aryan Civilization, Baba explains much about Tantra, as well as its 
relation to Veda. He also slightly refers to yoga. Extracts of that article 
follow: 

Usually the non-Aryans were content with little. What was developed in 
them was their introspective nature, which not only made them devotees 
of God, but infused in them a surging love for spiritual philosophy. The 
religious practices of the Aryans, however, entailed performing certain 
sacrifices in order to attain certain materialistic gains. That is, their 
religious observances were mainly ritualistic. On the whole, the non- 
Aryans were followers of Tantra, or subjective [i.e., introspective] 
sa'dhana'. Of course the non-Aryans, depending on their different 
degrees of intellectual development, ranged all the way from ani-mists 
to Brahma sa'dhakas [intuitional practitioners whose goal is the 
Absolute]; but in general, individual sa'dhana' ranked very high. The 
religion of the Vedic Aryans was, as a rule, one of prayer. It did not 
include even the subtlest hint of any intuitional meditation. And here 
lies the difference between the Brahmavada [theory of the Infinite En¬ 
tity] of the Vedas and the Upanishads on the one hand, and that of 
Tantra on the other. 

As previously mentioned, by "non-Aryans" no particular ethnic 
group was meant. When the Aryans first migrated to India, the non- 
Aryans were, on the whole, divided into three populations. Of these, the 
Negro-Austric Dravidians were the most developed intellectually and 
spiritually. Their Tantra sa'dhana' bore a predominance of jina'na 
[knowledge] and bhakti [devotion]. The next groups deserving mention 
are those of the Mongolian population. In their Tantra sa'dhana', karma 
[service] and bhakti [devotion] were predominant. The groups which 
constituted the Austrie population were almost equal to the Aryans 
intellectually, but in the practical and spiritual spheres they gradually 
lagged behind due to the comparative lack of dynamism of their society. 
This Austrie society was content to practice the extrover-sial aspects of 
Tantra (witchcraft, invultuation, magic, magical incantation for evil 
purposes, hypnotism, etc.). 

Tantra flourished in Bengal due to the pervasive intermixture of 
Dravidian and Mongolian blood.... 


In the life of Bengal, Tantra has surrendered to Veda only with re¬ 
spect to language. In fact there was no alternative but to acknowledge 
this defeat: The Bengalis of those days were followers of Tantra who 
spoke many different languages. When they decided to formulate a new 
language of their own, they were bound to accept the language of the 
foreign Aryans due to its highly expressive power. The Dravidian and 
Mongolian languages [although also a related to Sanskrit] were not so 
expressive as the Sanskrit language of the Vedas.... Due to the Vedic 
influence, particularly due to the influence of the eastern Vedic dialect, 
Ma'gadhii Prakrta, there emerged a Sanskrit-based Aryan language in 
Bengal. Later on, the Tantrics of this area composed Tantric literature 
using Sanskrit and the new Sanskrit-based Bengali.... 

Spiritual practice was common in the Tantric society. There is no 
spiritual vigor whatsoever in the lives of those who support pompous, 
so-called religious ceremonies, as there is in the lives of introspective 
spiritual practitioners. After the Aryans came into India, two types of 
practice used to take place side by side: on the one side the sacrificial 
fires of the rs'is [religious leaders], characterized by the smell of burning 
ghee [purified butter] and the sonorous refrains of those paying homage 
to the manes while offering oblations into the fire; and on the other side, 
the non-Aryans' Tantra sa'dhana', the practice of self-control and 
attainment of divine power. Spiritual depth and power of sa'dhana' 
brought fearlessness into the spiritual lives of the non-Aryans, as befit¬ 
ting staunch Tantrics.... 

Here it is necessary to remember that Tantra is not a religion, but a 
way of life, a system of sa'dhana. The fundamental goal of this 
sa'dhana'is to awaken the dormant jiivashakti [unit force], known as 
kulakun'd'alinii, and, after elevating it stage by stage, to merge it in 
Brahmabha'va [Cosmic Consciousness]. Tantra is a science of spiritual 
meditation or sa'dhana' which is equally applicable to anyone no matter 
what their religious affiliation might be. Tantra is certainly older than 
the Vedas. 111 Just as the shlokas or mantras of the Vedas were handed 
down from guru to disciple in a genealogical tradition, the Tantra sa'dhana' of 
the Mongolo-Dravidian society was handed down from guru to disciple 
hereditarily. The Vedas are theoretical—full of ritualistic ceremo

nies and formalisms. It would be incorrect to regard Tantra as a more 
recent version of those Vedic rituals: Tantra's esoteric practices had long 
been known in the society of sa'dhakas [spiritual aspirants]. Its 
theoretical portion was not as elaborate as that of the Vedas, which took 
years and years to memorize. 

When the Aryans came to India, roughly during the period of the 
Artharvaveda, they learned Tantra sa'dhana' to some extent after 
coming in contact with the Indian Tantrics. This resulted in the 
Artharvaveda being pervasively influenced by Tantra. Even if the 
orthodox Vedics try to reject the many Tantra-influenced portions of the 
Vedas as later interpolations, they will not be too convincing, for Tantra 
has now infiltrated into the marrow of the so-called Aryans. Although 
during the post-Vedic Buddhist era as well as the post-Buddhist 
Brahmanical era changes in the religious outlook of the people were 
apparent, the process of sa'dhana' remained Tantric as it does even 
today, for without Tantra, spiritual sa'dhana' is impossible. 

Yoga, which is the paramount factor in spiritual practices, is itself 
based on Tantra. The great Tantric Vashis't'ha, when he returned from 
China after learning the Chinese techniques of sa'dhana', brought about 
a great improvement in Tantra sa'dhana'. He was widely acclaimed as a 
great yogi. His book Yogava'shis't'ha is a philosophical exposition of the 
subtle spirituality of Tantra sa'dhana'. 

Momentarily diverting from Baba's article, it may be observed that 
yoga is thus a part of Tantra, indeed the subtlest aspect of the Tantric 
practice. Shiva Himself elucidated yoga, as did a number of the Tantra 
scriptures. Three of the other foremost authorities on yoga were also 
Tantrics: Krishna, Vashistha, and Patanjali. 

Patanjali was the last of the line, having lived only about 2000 years 
ago. Though Baba generally agrees with Patanjali, He differs on a few 
points. Most fundamental of these concern the very definition of yoga. 
Patanjali wrote: Yogash citta vrtii nirodha. This means "To suspend the 
function of thinking is Yoga." Baba explained that it is the nature of 
mind to think. So it is unnatural to try to stop that thinking process. 
Such an effort amounts to suppression, and therefore may be harmful. 

On the other hand, Baba quotes and supports a definition directly 
from the Tantras: Sam'yogo yogo ityukto jiiva'tma' Parama'tmanah. 


This means "The union of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul is 
yoga." This process is founded on a natural attraction toward infinite 
bliss or infinite love. As one develops love for God, simultaneously love 
for all of the creation is generated. The result is creative and expansive. 
Upon the ultimate merging of the individual mind with the Cosmic 
Mind, the individual thought process automatically ceases, as there is 
no longer any separate individual. Such a person is aware only of God, 
and no ego remains. 

One of the major etymological interpretations of Tantra also parallels 
this definition of yoga. Tan means to expand, and tra means to liberate. 
Thus Tantra means to become liberated from all sorts of bondage 
through theexpansion of one's self. We should clearly understand that 
yoga is a process of expansion, not contraction or suppression. 

Turning back to Baba's article: 

There are many who try to make a distinction between Hindu Tantra 
and Buddhist Tantra. This is absolutely wrong, for as I have said earlier, 
Tantra is one and only one. It is based on one sentiment, on one idea. 
The Buddhist and Hindu Tantras express the same thing in different 
words. 112 

After the Aryan settlement in India a great man was born into the 
non-Aryan society. Born into a Mongolo-Aryan family, this great man 
had a high nose and fair complexion. He was a great Tantric—a great 
yogi. The name of this M aha'purus'a [Great Personl of the non-Aryan 
society was Shiva. For one man to have so many qualities and endow¬ 
ments at the same time was beyond the comprehension of the people, so 
He was called Gun'a'tiita or Nirgun'a Purus'a [the Transcendental 


112 On this point of the identity between theseT antras (except in their terminology), Baba gives 
several pages of examples. 

All spiritual and religious systems are adaptable to Tantra, though some systems are better than 
others, as explained in the following saying from the Kuia'rn'ava Tantra: 

Uttamo Brahmasadbha'vo 
Madhyama' dhya'na dha'ran'a) 

J apastu'ti sya'dhadhama' 

Mu'rtipu'ja' dhama'dhama' 

This means: Ideation on Brahma or God is the best, meditation and concentration are second 
best, repetitious incantation and eulogistic prayer are the worst, and idol worship is the worst of 
the worst. 


or Non-Attributional Person]. As the result of His Tantra sa'dhana' He 
attained extraordinary powers, which He employed for the good of 
humanity. It was He who systematized the science of Tantra and thus He 
was the guru or the father of Tantrics and yogis. To this Self-realized 
M aha'purus'a there was no distinction of high and low. People of all 
classes, from the highest to the lowest, were dear to Him. Irrespective of 
class—Aryan, non-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric or Mongolian—all flocked 
to Him. He showered His grace on them all equally. As the battles raged 
between the "gods" on the one hand and the "demons" and "monsters" 
on the other (needless to say, "gods" meant the handsome Aryan leaders, 
and "demons" and "monsters" meant the non-Aryans in general), the 
non-Aryan "demons" and "monsters" became more and more powerful 
through the blessings of this Shiva. All the ra'ks'asas and asuras 
[demons and monsters] were Shiva's obedient devotees and followers. 
With the help and blessings of Shiva they destroyed the might and power 
of the "gods." According to Sanskrit stories, when the gods would seek 
the help of Brahma' and Vis'riu, even those two would not dare to 
oppose Shiva; rather they would save the gods through a compromise 
with Him. 

Shiva had such a forgiving nature, born out of His spirit of benevo¬ 
lence, that even the most wicked could easily draw on His kindness. That 
is why to everybody He became A 'shutos'a (Easy to Please). Due to 
Shiva's pervasive influence over their society, the non-Aryans, that is, 
the Tantrics, used to worship Him as God, and according to their 
respective intellectual strata they regarded and accepted Him in His 
different bearings. Just as the Aryans began to identify Shiva with their 
own gods and goddesses, the kaola maha'ta'ntrikas [great Tantrics in 
the tradition of kulakun'd'alinii yoga] began to regard Shiva as identical 
with Nirgun'a Brahma [unqualified Supreme Consciousness]. The 
foremost cause behind this conception of theirs was the absolute de¬ 
tachment and self-forgetful bearing of Shiva, the lord of supernatural 
and miraculous power. Shiva's self-sacrificing nature earned Him the 
name Bhola'na'tha [one absolutely indifferent to his own status] among 
the non-Aryans. All were attracted to Shiva's supernatural power, His 
imposing personality, His limitless qualities and the calm, tranquil ra¬ 
diance of His features.... 

Shiva's influence over the Aryans increased more and more. The Aryans 
began to feel that, being so indebted to Shiva, they could no longer 
afford to disregard Him. It was Shiva who had taught them spiritual 
sa'dhana, asanas and pra'n'a'ya'ma [meditation, yoga postures and 
breath control]; the secret of good health; the science of medicine; and 
the developed art of dance and music. For His excellence in dancing, 
both the Aryans and non-Aryans used to call Him Nat'ara'ja, and for 
His proficiency in vocal music, Na'datanu. No one has counted the 
number of medicines He invented for every kind of disease. He was the 
first preceptor of the a'yurveda'ca'ryas [teachers of a'yurveda, the 
science of medicine to increase longevity]. The asuras [Mongolians] 
were cured of many serious diseases due to His grace. Both the Aryans 
and the non-Aryans thought that since Shiva knew so many remedies, 

He was perhaps immortal, and so they named Him Mrtyuinjaya 
[conqueror of death].... 

The present social system of India (which is fundamentally Tantric) 
was developed by Shiva. 113 After accepting Shiva as God without any 
reservation, the Aryans appropriated everything good of the Dravidians 
and the other non-Aryans. Of course this did not diminish the Aryans' 
prestige—rather it enhanced it.... 

Not only in India, but in quite a large part of the world, in every 
sphere of life, the laws and injunctions of Shiva alone prevailed for a 
long time. Even today the civilization of modern India is intrinsically 
Tantric. On the outside only is there a Vedic stamp. Or if we take the 
Indian civilization as an enameled ornament, then its gold is Tantric, 
and the enamel Vedic.... 

When the Indians were about to forget the teachings of Shiva due to 
their fascination with the mundane objectivities of the world, there came 
another sublime entity like Shiva, who reminded them of those 
teachings. That great personality was Shri Krs'n'a [Krishna]. The ques¬ 
tion as to which of the two was greater, Krs'n'a or Shiva, does not arise, 
because all knowers of Brahma are one: all are Brahma. 


113 Shiva was the first guru to loudly proclaim that men and women are spiritually equal. He 
initiated Hisdaughter and Histhree wives, who all became famous yoginis. He also was the first 
to introduce the system of marriage in order to bind together father, mother and children.
