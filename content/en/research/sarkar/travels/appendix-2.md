Prout is such a vast concept that a reasonable introduction to it 
requires an entire book. Baba's series Prout in a Nutshell consists of 
over twenty books, and yet, as its title indicates, that the entire series 
provides only fundamental principles and policies with examples. To 
attempt to explain Prout in an appendix is an injustice to the theory. 
Nevertheless, so many references are made to Prout throughout the 
diary that the reader deserves some sort of explanation. 

1) Prout is based on Shri P.R. Sarkar's concept of Neo-humanism, 
which advocates a society concerned not only for human beings, but 
also for animals, plants, and inanimate resources. Neo-humanism 
does not accept narrow groupisms which function as social and psy¬ 
chological causes of exploitation. Such groups condemn and work 
against those who are outside of their own territory, clan, or belief 
system. Exploitative political power groups and selfish economic 
interest groups commonly dominate others through pseudo-culture 
and the mass media. As a result, the life of the entire planet is threat¬ 
ened by massive ecological destruction in the name of progress. 
Education and people's movements should help expose the dogmas 
and superstitions which feed such narrow-mindedness. For this 
purpose, it is also needed to awaken benevolent human conscience 
and the capacity for rational analysis. Ultimately Neo-humanism 
aims at love for one and all, a state which is founded on spiritual 
enlightenment. 

2) There should be maximum utilization , rational distribution and 
proper balance of all physical, mental and spiritual resources. Hence 
the name Progressive Utilization Theory. 

3) At any given time society is dominated bv a specific psychological 
outlook or psychological class . If any class becomes over-entrenched 
in power, it tends to suppress progressive changes. Prout has a sys¬ 
tem of checks and balances which discourages this tendency, and 
encourages a forward shift in power whenever it is needed. 

4) Economic planning should be de-centralized as far as is practical. 
The most important planning is on the lowest level—the block level, 
i.e. an area having about 100,000 people, having similar cultural 
and ecological concerns. Lower levels should be coordinated by 
higher levels, for example, blocks by states, states by regions, and 
regions by nations. Coordination represents concerns of trade, 
transport, communications, etc. The basis of boundaries between 
governing areas should gradually change from historical or political 
bias, to economic, ecological and cultural factors. 

5) All levels of planning should follow certain economic principles 
including the following: 

* Everyone must be guaranteed the purchasing capacity for their 
minimal necessities including food, shelter, clothing, medical care 
and education. 

* Opportunities for employment must be provided to all. 

* There should be a progressive incentive system to encourage ini¬ 
tiative, creativity and labor. Incentives may be given not only in 
the form of money, but also in kind. They may include, for ex¬ 
ample, equipment by which a person can better his performance, 
improved working facilities, household items, or other immenities. 
Incentives may also be provided through special education, new 
job possibilities, increased free time, cultural opportunities, rec¬ 
reational facilities, and so on. 

* There may always be a gap between the minimum and maximum 
economic levels. The economic vitality of a society, however, is 
judged by the speed of improvement in the minimum standard of 
living. In a healthy society, the gap is gradually diminishing. 

* Improvement in technology is beneficial to mankind when it re¬ 
sults in neither ecological imbalance nor loss of employment. Due 
to improved mechanization, workers should benefit whenever 
possible by diminishment of working hours without loss of salary. 

* Ignoring psychological factors at the working place is harmful to 
both the workers and their output. Therefore a portion of the bud¬ 
get and management time must be allocated to ensure cleanliness, 
safety, equability, ecological care, and an atmosphere which 
encourages initiative and creativity. 

6) These planning principles should be implemented within the 
framework of self-sufficient economic zones . These zones may be 
created by blocks and regions joining together on the basis of 
economic potentiality, ethnic similarity, and environmental features. 
When the local people are directly working for their zone's economic 
well-being and self-sufficiency, then they become highly motivated. 
The local government must plan for a cooperative economy between 
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, commerce and professional ser¬ 
vices. The government will naturally be concerned for maintaining 
long-term fertility of its soil and all-round ecological balance 

7) Such economic zones prefer the development of local resources 
in lieu of exporting raw materials or importing finished products. 
This policy encourages the growth of a healthy indigenous 
manufacturing sector, full employment, and greater security in times 
of difficulty. 

8) Within each zone there should be a three-tiered structure of eco¬ 
nomic enterprises. 

* Cooperatives constitute the largest sector, including all agriculture 
and most industries and commercial companies. They are owned 
and managed by their workers. They should be profitable and 
competitive. 

* Key industries provide essential resources such as minerals, en¬ 
ergy, large scale transport, and communication. They are managed 
as public utilities. Boards of directors are elected democratically, 
and workers participate in management. 


* Private ventures include small-scale industries, shops and 
services. 

9) Through the inspiration provided by the multifarious incentive sys¬ 
tem, through cooperative ownership, and through economic zonal 
planning, safeguards are created against over-accumulation of 
wealth in which vested interests hoard resources. 

10) Zonal planning should see that villages have sufficient cleanliness, 
natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural and educational facilities so 
that all people, animals and plants will enjoy the process of de¬ 
centralization. Over-populated cities must become a thing of the 
past. 

11) Prout is not a Utopian philosophy . Society is the field for everyone's 
development, and therefore imperfections will always exist. Prout 
recognizes the need for checks and balances on individual power. 
High caliber leadership consists of persons having certain qualities 
such as 

* a reputation for honesty and wisdom 

* a history of community service 

* demonstrated skills in leadership, management and technical 
knowledge. 

Such leaders should be elected democratically. Democracy , however, 
is only successful according to the mentality of the voters. Therefore 
a literate, well-educated and well-informed electorate is essential. 
Accordingly, the influence of the mass media and wealth in politics 
must be regulated. 

12) One of the fundamental works in establishing Prout is to stimu¬ 
late well-intentioned and capable people to participate in the lead¬ 
ership process. It is commonly believed that power corrupts, and 
more power corrupts more. If potential Prout leaders engage them¬ 
selves in intensive social work, healthy living, sacrifice for others, 
relevant technical education, and spiritual practices— then they may 
develop the incorruptible qualities needed in the leaders of a soci¬ 
ety based on coordinated cooperation. 

13) Prout supports the eventual establishment of a representative world 
government . As long as extreme disparity in wealth exists between 
nations, however, world government is impossible. Only when small countries are free of the threat of domination by big countries will 
global cooperation be possible. Solving global problems depends on 
establishing local economic security. Political freedom without 
economic independence has no value. Hence Prout's policy is eco¬ 
nomic decentralization and centralized political cooperation. 

14) Useful theory is generally only evolved on the basis of practical 
experimentation . Therefore the first steps in expanding the Prout 
theory result from attempts to implement it in communities, such as 
Master Units. As Master Units merge their concerns with the 
surrounding neighborhoods and villages, Prout theory is developed 
and demonstrated. Practical experience is also gained through or¬ 
ganizing public education programs and social movements. Such 
movements support indigenous culture, work for ecological im¬ 
provement, and struggle against psycho-economic exploitation.
