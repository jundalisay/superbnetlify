To ensure the maximum utilization of every inch of land, there is also a system of planting in the boundary areas of all schools, farms, orchards, homes, etc., as well as beside all roads. 

For example, trees with spreading branches, like most fruit trees and even some timber trees, should be planted all around the perimeter of such places at fixed distances. 

Palm trees, which grow straight up, should be planted in between the fruit trees, as they do not block the sun light from the fruit trees. 

Between the fruit trees and the palm trees, filler plants should be planted. Examples of small filler plants are:

1. Edible anthurium, a root crop
2. Permanent cotton, a shrub
3. Arrowroot, a root crop. 

If the soil is deep and good, plant anthurium. 

If the soil is stony and poor, plant permanent cotton. 

If the soil is of medium quality, then plant arrowroot. 

In between all these, there is still space for associate plants to the filler plants. 

With anthurium plant, Chinese mini-grape.

With permanent cotton plant, ghee kavla, a vegetable.

With arrowroot plant, wild mini bitter gourd. 

The boundary wall should also be topped with wire to grow wire plants, in series, as in the lakeside plantations. 

Where trees are planted around the boundary of agricultural land, care should be taken so that they do not shade the crops from the sun.

Some examples of boundary plants grown in Ánanda Nagar include:

Boundary plants for oil seeds include:

- Paraguay coconut alternating, with baŕa ellachi as a fill-up plant.

There is no fixed rule for fill-up plants on boundaries in compounds. 

Sisal makes a good boundary, roadside and riverside plant.
- It is the usual fill-gap on roadsides and many boundaries. 
- It also helps to prevent erosion.
