## Energy Production

The following energy can be produced on a small scale:
- solar energy: This can power lights and water from solar panels
- thermal power: This is from coal and other fossil fuels
- bio-gas: This is from bio-mass waste for generators, cooking, lighting and small generators
- hydroelectricity
- pneumatic power: This is powered by the wind. It is one of the cheapest sources of energy for pumps and generators because the only costs are the initial capital investment to construct the mill and that of maintenance. 


The bio-gas plant harnesses the gas generated by the decomposition of the bio-mass, which can then be collected and used for various purposes. 

Cow, buffalo and human excreta can be used in bio-gas plants.

The slurry is an excellent manure because it breaks down in about one week, whereas fresh manure takes up to 6 months. 

Slurry takes only 3 days to reach the roots of a plant compared to 3 months for normal manure. 

Slurry can nourish a plant within 10 days, whereas normal cow dung takes up to 9 months.

Small-scale hydroelectric plants can also be constructed in the right environment. The Daksina River at AÃÅnanda Nagar can allow a hydroelectric power plant. It can produce power for up to 9 months of the year.
