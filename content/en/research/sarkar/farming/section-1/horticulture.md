## Horticulture

Fruit and vegetable gardens should be established on all farming projects. There are many varieties of fruit. Fruits can be utilized to make jams, marmalade, jellies, dried fruits, etc.


## Floriculture

Floriculture is the cultivation of flowers. Jasmine, magnolia, roses and so on can be used to make essences which in turn can be used to produce many other products. 

- Tube roses can be grown and sold throughout the world just as roses are today. 
- Roses grow very well in red soil. 
- Floral nectar can be collected from lotus and is very good for all kinds of eye diseases, including retinal detachment.

Honey can be prepared from the flowers of the lotus, lily, cornel and cotton tree. 

A huge amount of honey is available in the flowers of the lotus, lily and cotton tree. 

The lotus and lily also give floral nectar – nectar which is prepared by the flowers, not by the bees. This is a part of floriculture. 

Floral nectar should be produced from floriculture.

How can floral nectar be collected? It has to be collected with the help of a dropper or syringe. 

When I was young I used to eat the seeds of the lotus. In those days they were generally available throughout Burdwan. I also used to take floral nectar by licking the flower. 

From the honey and floral nectar of lotus and lily, many types of medicines can be made. If this honey and floral nectar is sold in the market, it will command a very high price. 

To extract floral nectar one has to employ the same method as doctors use to extract blood. This is because many ants and insects feed on floral nectar. A syringe can extract it without getting clogged up.

The field of floriculture has been neglected very much. It should be developed. 

We can easily make rose scent and rose water from the rose garden at Ánanda Nagar.


## Pisciculture

Fish should be cultivated in lakes, dams and ponds because they help conserve and purify the water. 

Small fish can also be cultivated in the paddy fields during the rainy season. 

Fish are the natural food of birds, so they are an essential part of a balanced ecology.
