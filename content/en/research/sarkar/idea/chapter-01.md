## Publisher's Note

Jamalpur, Bihar, is the eastern Indian town where AMPS was founded in 1955. 
- It was previously known for its large railway workshop, at one time the largest in Asia, established during the British period. 

Here, in the summer of 1959, Sarkar gave lectures, in a mixture of English and Hindi, to a small group of followers. 
- At the conclusion of the seminar, the notes of the participants were assembled and edited into an English manuscript. 

<!-- The manuscript was then sent to the author for any necessary additions and alterations; thereafter it was published in book form. -->

<!-- Like no other book, but rather like spiritual practice itself, Idea and Ideology methodically, in a careful sequence, expands the reader’s horizons and mind. It concludes by using the spiritual vantage that has been gained, to focus on the social problems of the earth. (The concise socio-economic precepts known as the Five Fundamental Principles of Prout made their first appearance, at least in published form, in this book.) -->

Sarkar classified Idea and Ideology, together with Ánanda Sútram, as the darshana shástra, or philosophical treatise, of AMPS. 

Ánanda Sútram was dictated by Sarkar 2 years after the Idea and Ideology seminar.
- It is a collection of Sanskrit aphorisms with terse explanations. 
- Its style of presentation is different from that of Idea and Ideology. But its subject matter and order of topics closely resemble the Idea and Ideology pattern.

Editions 2-4 of Idea and Ideology involved only minor grammatical alterations of the first edition. 

At the time of the drafting of the fifth edition in 1978, certain grammatical changes were made with the express approval of Sarkar. 

These changes related to passages where initially the meaning was not completely clear, and where therefore to edit the grammar might affect the meaning.

The sixth edition involved no change from the fifth edition. The present, seventh, edition is the first annotated edition.

Readers comparing this edition to other recent editions will find on page 5 of this edition a sequence of nine words, and on page 81 another sequence of nine words, that did not appear in editions 4-6. 

These sequences of words appeared in the first three editions, but were inadvertently omitted thereafter.

## The Principle of Consciousness and the Principle of Activity

<!-- 

 -->

Crudification or Saiṋcara is the centrifugal activity of the Nucleus (Puruśottama) of the Macrocosm. 

This Nucleus is:
- the center, witness, or subject of the Macrocosm which is Its periphery, experience, or object.
- **The Principle of Consciousness** <!-- Pure -->
 <!-- or the makes the Hence this Macrocosmic Nucleus or  is --> <!-- which witnesses  counterpart of the objective Macrocosm. --> 

<!-- Puruśa or Citishakti (power of mind) is  -->


<!-- Prakrti --> **The Principle of Activity** is the **inherent** tendency of the transcendental <!-- Puruśa -->Principle of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness. 
- Hence, the activation of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness without the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> <!-- the presence of a second principle --> is impossible. 
- Action results only when the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> gets a chance to express itself. <!-- scope of expression. -->

The 2 <!-- factors --> forces are thus:

1. Consciousness (Puruśa)
2. Activity (Prakrti)

These are dual in theory but singular in spirit. 
- Their collective body is just like that of fire: we cannot think of fire without its heat. 
- In the same way, one cannot think of Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> without Activity <!-- Prakrti --> in the collective body of Existence (Brahma).

Activity <!-- Prakrti --> may thus be defined as an attribute of Consciousness.
- Activity is feminine
- Consciousness is masculine. <!--  Puruśa. --> 

Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> remains objectless <!-- or nirguńa --> when it has no Activity. <!-- We say that it ithere is no expressed activity of Prakrti, that is, where activity is dormant.  -->

This <!-- Prakrti --> Activity is also a collective flow of 3 immanent principles:

1. Sentient<!-- or sattva -->: This creates the identity or ego or pure “I” feeling
2. Mutative <!-- or rajah -->: This transforms identity into an active identity as the Doer “I” or active ego
3. Static <!-- or tamah -->: This causes the <!-- mutative --> ego to <!-- imbibe the results of actions of the Doer “I”, that is, by --> create the ego-effect <!-- done “I” out --> from the action of the <!-- of the Doer “I” as the results of the latter --> active ego*

> *Superphysics note: This is the 'me' of Descartes


<!-- . Prakrti is the collective name of these three principles. -->

In Objectless Existence (Nirguńa Brahma), Activity <!-- of Prakrti --> is dormant. 
- She cannot manifest Herself, though the eternal flow exists. 

Thus, the flow of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> means the flow of 3 belligerent forces. 

Mathematically speaking, this fight results in a triangle of forces.
- Consciousness <!-- Puruśa or Shiva --> at this stage gets encircled by Activity <!-- Shivánii (here Prakrti is called Shivánii) --> as a triangle of forces.


## Crudification (Saiṋcara)

The internal clash and cohesion, division and association of these 3 immanent principles causes creation to come out from a point in any one of the vertices of the triangle of Active forces. 
- The Macrocosmic Nucleus is the center of the triangle. 
- The Vertex (Shambhú) is the point in Consciousness where creation comes out.

<!--  is the Puruśa or consciousness at the vertex . The central point of the triangle is the  -->

The Macrocosmic Nucleus is:
- the subjectivated Consciousness <!-- Shiva --> and 
- the center of all the creative principles.

The movement which starts from this Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> <!-- as the centre --> is <!-- an exterial --> divisive or centrifugal. It changes from subtle to crude and is called The Crudification Cycle<!--  Saiṋcara -->. <!--  is the name given to this particular movement in the spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga. --> It comes out from the Vertex <!-- Shambhú --> as a never-ending process.

The vertices of the triangle of forces are points having certain positions, but no absolute movement. **It is a stage of stagnancy and hence dominated by the static principle.** 

The static force is a crudifying factor. 

The mutative force overcomes the static force. It causes a stir of expression on the static seed. This expression is logically and scientifically is:
- unfathomable <!-- in gravity -->
- sentient in tendency
