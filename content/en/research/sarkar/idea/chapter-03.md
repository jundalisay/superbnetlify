## The Created Layers (Bhútatattva)

Crudification (saiṋcara) is a process of analysis, transforming one into many. 

Avidyámáyá is the operative force behind its multicreative characteristics. 
- At different phases of this crudification, <!--  or --> creation-layers (bhútas) with their peculiar properties come into existence.

Bhúta means “created being”. Generally, it refers to the past. 

Through the influence of the sentient force on the Macrocosmic Nucleus<!-- Puruśottama -->, the Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva --> comes into being. 
- It turns into the Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> by the activation of the mutative force. <!--  this Mahattattva is metamorphosed into ;  -->

The Principle of Activity (Prakrti) then converts a part of the subjectivated “I” into the objectivated “I” or done “I” or mindstuff of the Cosmic Entity. 

The "Cosmic Mind" is the combination of:
- The Identity layer
- The Ego layer<!--  Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva and citta.-->
- Mindstuff  

The stages of transformation of Cosmic Consciousness prior to the exhibition of Cosmic <!-- citta --> mindstuff are not objective realities. 
- **This is why <!--  in the strict sense of the term, and as such --> the existence of the Cosmic Mind cannot be established unless<!--  and until --> its psychic projection is logically dealt with.**

Even after the formation of mindstuff <!-- citta -->, static Activity<!--  Prakrti --> goes on influencing the Cosmic mindstuff more and more.
- It causes:
  - further crudification or decrease in the intermolecular and interatomic spaces and 
  - gradual increase in the chemical affinity.


## Aethereal Layer

In the first phase of this crudification, the chemical affinity permits the transmission of sound waves only. 

**Hence, the aethereal body or ákásha is formed when the mindstuff gets a bit cruder and is able to carry sound waves.**
- This aether <!-- ákásha --> is the first rudimental factor on the physical level.


## Aerial Layer

The continued influence of static Activity <!-- Prakrti --> increases the chemical affinity. 
- This decreases the intermolecular and interatomic spaces, making the <!-- factor or bhúta --> layer cruder than the aether<!-- ákásha -->. 

It enables the <!-- second factor, as --> the aerial layer (váyutattva), to carry the wave or sensation of touch over, in addition to the ability <!-- extant capacity --> of transmitting sound waves.


## Luminous

The ever-increasing influence of static Activity <!-- Prakrti --> creates an internal clash in the created layers <!-- váyubhúta --> giving rise to sparks of light.
- This slowly converts the created layers <!-- váyubhúta --> into the luminous layer (tejastattva). 

The sense of vision or radiation <!-- of rúpatanmátra --> is the special property of this layer. <!-- luminous factor. -->


## Solid and Liquid

With the continued action of the static principle, the liquid body and finally solid structures are formed. 
- The liquid entity is perceptible by the additional sense of taste (or flow)
- The solid body is perceptible by the further addition of the sense of smell.

The above formations are gradual, not abrupt. 
- The intermediate stage between mindstuff and aether is neither totally theoretical <!-- abstract --> nor material
- Similarly, the sun is at an intermediate stage in between, and not totally, the aerial and the luminous layers
- The earth in its infancy was neither luminous nor liquid
  - Gradually, it was converted into a liquid body
  - Slowly, the outer surface was turned into solid. 
  - In its inner body, the earth is still in liquid form. 
  - In the more interior portion, the luminous and aerial <!-- gaseous --> layers are being slowly converted into liquid.

Each and every layer<!--  bhúta --> has its corresponding sense-organ to access it. <!-- is accessible to a certain sense of conceptions or perceptions, by which the sensory organs recognize or classify it.  -->

Various combinations of these layers <!-- bhútatattvas --> result in the physical creation, first of the inanimate, and later of the animated structures. 
- The crudest solid is the final stage of crudification <!-- saiṋcara. -->
- The start of animation <!-- stage --> is the beginning of subtlification <!-- the process of pratisaiṋcara. -->

Due to subtlification, the energy <!-- or práńa --> working therein slowly gets converted into vital energy (práńáh). 
- This vital energy is the direct cause of life. 
- It thus controls the activities of the animated physical structure. 

Hereafter, the circle of subtlification <!-- pratisaiṋcara --> starts functioning with the coordinated cooperation of the vital energy <!-- práńáh --> and mind. 
- But in the absence of a congenial environment for vital energy, the physical structure will explode due to ever-increasing internal pressure
- This <!--  the práńáh to get expressed, as in the case of --> happens in dead or dying celestial bodies

This explosion is called structural dissociation or jad́asphot́a. 
- The resulting dissociated component layers <!-- (dissociated as a result of jad́asphot́a) --> get mingled up with their respective layers<!-- tattvas -->.
- This converts the solid layer <!-- This process of jad́asphot́a, as a result of which the crudest factor, --> into certain subtler factors and is called reverse-crudification<!-- , may be termed “negative saiṋcara”. --> 

The aether<!--  factor --> is the subtlest physical layer.

The solid layer can never, as a result of reverse-crudification via structural dissociation <!-- negative saiṋcara or jad́asphot́a -->, be transformed into something subtler than the ether.
- If it were so converted into the next subtler factor which is citta, then it would mean that the Macrocosm withdrew its thought-waves.

Thus, the created layers <!-- bhútas --> are not any new stuff, but only the crudified forms of Cosmic mindstuff. 
- These manifest at different stages of the crudification <!-- saiṋcara --> process when due to the external pressure of static Activity<!-- Prakrti -->:
  - the intermolecular and interatomic spaces decrease
  - chemical affinity increases.

Tanmátratattva: Tat + mátra = tanmátra. 

In Sanskrit, tat means “that”, mátra means “minutest quantity”. Hence "tanmátra" denotes a microscopic fraction of “that” (of “that bhúta”).

Tanmatra is a quantum-perception of that layer.
