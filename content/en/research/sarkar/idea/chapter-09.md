<!-- Psycho-Spiritual Parallelism -->

The Cosmic Consciousness acts as the witnessing entity with the help of His Mindpower<!-- Citishakti -->. 
- The wavelength of this Mindpower is infinite.
- So we say that it flows in a straight line. 

The atman is the witnessing entity of the unit mind.
- When the mind <!-- or manah --> takes the atman as its object, the mental waves will get straightened gradually.
  - This is done by complete surrender. 
  - There is no other way because the mind is the object of the átman. 
- In the end, that mind's wavelength will become infinite. 
  - Those waves will also flow in a straight line.
  - The mind will then get transformed into the átman. 
  - This state is called samádhi. 

Thus, the psychic waves attain a parallelism with the spiritual waves of the átman.
- This psycho-spiritual parallelism is known as “idea” or bháva. 
- When this idea is conceived on the psychic level, it is “ideology”.

Ideology, therefore, is merely the conception of idea.
- “Ideology” involves in it a spiritual sense. 
- It is an inspiration which has a parallelism with the Spiritual Entity.

Hence, it is wrong to call some materialistic or political principles of a person, party, nation or federation as an “ideology”. 


<!-- ## Sound and Meaning -->

## Mental-physical Parallelism 

Sound <!-- Shabda or --> is in its initial stage a psychic wave.   

<!-- Let us see what artha, or meaning, is. -->

We hear a sound, but the concept of the word uttered is not clear till the mental waves are brought in contact with the physical concept involved. 

A child hears the word “cat”. 
- He sees a cat and the mother says, “See, my son, that is a cat.”
- The boy associates the word “cat” with the actual cat.

That means he establishes a parallelism between:
- the mental waves created by the sound “cat” and
- the physical wave coming from the physical form of the cat. 

Hence:
- a word or sound is a <!-- psychic --> mental wave which represents a physical thing.
- a meaning is therefore a parallelism between mind and matter, as <!-- psycho-physical --> mental-physical parallelism 
  - this parallelism can be either direct or indirect.

<!-- is the meaning of a word which itself (the word) is .  -->

<!-- So psycho-spiritual parallelism is idea and psycho-physical parallelism is artha, or meaning. -->

Indirect parallelism is when the physical object expressed in the mental word<!--  (psychic wave) --> is not perceived directly. 
- The physical parallelism cannot be made directly
- Instead, it is made with the help of:
  - some internal saḿskára already formed or
  - some description made by some other source.

Mental-physical parallelism always tends to make the <!-- psychic --> mental waves cruder. 
- If the mental wave gets cruder, human beings will be transformed into cruder beings*. 
- They take the path of reverse subtilification. <!-- negative pratisaiṋcara --> <!-- and spiritual elevation will remain a dream. --> 

> *Superphysics Note: This is why scientists naturally become non-spiritual <!-- and why memorization tends to stifle spiritual growth -->



But in daily life, we must establish mental-physical parallelism. 
- But this does not mean that human destiny sealed forever. 

**We can impose <!-- have a supreme position of the --> the spiritual wave over the physical wave**
- **We do this by perceiving the physical wave as one of the manifestations of the spiritual infinite One.**
- This is what we mean by Brahmacarya.
  - It is the assimilation of the unit mind's mental wave into the eternal waves of the Macrocosm. 

We give a <!-- Ananda Marga lays down for the spiritual aspirant a --> practical method for this spiritual imposition to prevent the mental waves from becoming cruder. 
- We have a practice of spiritual auto-suggestion (bháva sádhaná) at the time of action. <!-- Ananda Marga -->
- This makes the mind tend towards Brahmacarya and thereby towards mental-spiritual parallelism, the only way to ultimate liberation. 

To attain mental liberation, the mental waves must be made subtler. This is only possible by:
- entertaining only subtler mental waves or
- an inspiring spiritual force that makes the mental waves parallel with spiritual ones.


## Personality

Complete development of the integrated personality is essential for perfect spiritual realization of the human being. 

Personality is a collaborated composition of 3 bodies:

1. The physical body or jad́ádhára
2. The mental body or bhávádhára
3. The spiritual or supramental body, or cetanádhára. 

<!-- Personality is  physical, metaphysical and spiritual bodies. So  -->


### Food and Struggle

The proper development of each body is essential. This is done by:
- proper food
  - This nourishes the body
- proper struggle
  - This purifies the body


#### Physical Food and Struggle

Spiritual aspirants must be careful about their food.
- Physical labour is the struggle in the physical field. <!--  or  helps in purifying the physical structure.  -->

#### Mental or Metaphysical Food and Struggle

<!-- The  body needs:
- physical and mental struggle
- mental food.  -->

Mental food is sourced from ideas that represent mental-spiritual parallelism. 

Faiths devoid of any rationality prevailed in ancient days and were supported by our forefathers.
- Mental struggle results from aggressive adoption of newer and progressive thoughts instead of blindly clinging to such faiths. 

#### Spiritual Food and Struggle

The spiritual body is the higher mind.
- It is a subtler taste or higher taste. 

When the microcosm keeps itself absorbed in the Macrocosm:
- the meaner and cruder thoughts wave away. 
- the spiritual body gets strengthened by longing for the Great – an intense desire to be for Him. 
  - This is the real bhakti or devotion. 
  - This is the ultimate and only way to final liberation or final union.

Shrii Shrii Shankaracharya has declared bhakti as the best way to mokśa.<!--  – the ultimate liberation: Mokśakárańa samagryáḿ bhaktireva gariiyasii. -->
