## Waves

Brahma Cakra is the Cosmic Circle. It is a Cosmic dance in which every created object, under the magic spell of the Cosmos, is moving in proper harmony and rhythm. 

An object or objectivity is nothing but a wave motion within the body of the Cosmos. <!-- The philosophy of Ananda Marga thus --> We thus establish the wave theory of modern science through an independent logical outlook. 

Life consists only of an ocean of waves.

Every layer (bhúta) from the aethereal to the solid is in an eternal flow.
- The very existence of the created layers <!-- bhútatattva --> is just a pattern of waves. 

Quantum-percpetions (Tanmátras) are a microscopic fraction of the waves, taken in a collective form by the mindstuff via the sensory organs<!-- -cum-citta -->. 
- <!-- These microscopic fractions carried through waves are called . --> Hence, quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> <!-- are nothing but --> are the waves produced by the objects as a result of reflection of the subtler layer <!-- bhúta --> on the cruder ones.

<!-- Tanmátras --> Quantum-perceptions in the mathematical sense are heterogeneous, not homogeneous.
- This leads to the varieties in the perceptible external world. 
- This heterogeneity is specialized by the difference in wavelengths amongst different quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> internally or externally of the scope of any particular layer <!-- bhúta -->.


Ákásha or the aether is theoretical. 
- It is the subtlest of all the layers<!-- bhútas -->, having the maximum wavelength. 
- Its flow faces no physical hindrance, whereas the other layers<!--  bhútas --> do face some.

A wave can:
- **move freely only when it is in harmony with previous waves and their curvatures.** 
- **pass through an object where there is no physical obstruction or hindrance from a subtler wave, that is, subtler waves can pass through cruder waves.** 

Under such circumstances, there is always an adjustment of wavelengths. 
- This results in the creation of physical diversities.

A proper adjustment of wavelength means adjustment at the 2 pauses of the waves:
- the sentient pause and
- the static pause

The sentient pause in the wave is where:
- upward momentum is finally exhausted
- the wave is just about to start downward movement

The static pause is where:
- downward movement has ended
- upward motion is just about to start.

They represent the crest and trough of physical science.
- **The greater the wavelength of any layer, the higher the chance of the other waves passing through.** <!--  this adjustment of the striking . -->
- When an object lets a wave pass through, then it does not come within the scope of sensory nerves. 
- **But when the wave is reflected back, then our sensory nerves perceive its existence.**
<!--  does not get such a passage, that is, it -->
<!-- Let us examine the process of actual perception and see how it occurs.  -->

<!-- HOW TO REFLECT SUBTLER WAVES??? -->

<!-- The existence of -->**A physical structure is nothing but a state of continuous vibration.** 
- Its very existence demands eternal movement. 
- This vibration creates waves which strike the gateways of the sense-organs.
  - From them, a sympathetic vibration within the sensory nerve is conveyed to the actual organ in the brain. 

**In the brain, the unit mindstuff takes the form of the vibration.** 
- This makes the ego feel that it is perceiving its object.

For example, when the light waves coming from an object strike the eye's retina, the optical nerve creates a similar vibration in the optical fluid. 
- This conveys the vibration to a point in the brain known as cakśu indriya.
- Mindstuff then takes the form of the object. <!-- ahaḿtattva or --> 
- The ego feels “I am seeing the object”

Thus, actual perception is achieved by <!-- made through a process in --> the nerves carrying vibrations from the gateways of the organs to the actual <!-- sites of the particular --> organs in the brain. <!-- This is the case with taste perception and other sensory activities.  -->
- If any of the sensory nerves are defective, that type of perception will not be experienced by the ego.

**In other words, the objective perception is always attributed to the merits and demerits of the sensory nerves.**
- The vibration or wave *radiated* by an object is the "out-going quantum-perception"<!--  tanmátra” -->
- The vibration or wave *received* by the sensory nerves is the "incoming quantum-perception"<!--  tanmátra” -->.


## The Sensory Layer

<!-- Indriyatattva -->

The mind is the master which perceives, orders and acts with the help of organs <!-- indriyas -->, both sensory and motor. 

The <!-- indriyas or --> organs are 10:
- five sensory
- five motor

The sensory organs <!-- indriyas --> receives the different quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras -->.

The motor organs <!-- indriyas --> create quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> according to the inherent reactive-momenta <!-- saḿskára --> and transmit them in a crude way. <!-- n extroversial style. -->

**A very important point to be noted here is that the immanent capacity of an object, whether aethereal or solid, for discharging quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras, --> remains the same.** 

**Any increase in the number of sense perceptions does not affect the total intensity of perception. It remains constant in a mathematical manner.**
- If the solid can transmit the 5 fundamental perceptions of sound, touch, form, taste and smell with equal intensity, it does not mean that each and every perception of this solid quantum-perception <!-- tanmátra --> will have the same intensity of sound waves transmitted by the aethereal body.

The aethereal body has the singular characteristic of transmitting sound waves.
- These sound waves have the collective intensity of all the 5 quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> transmitted by the solid body having the multilateral sensory functions.*

> *Superphysics Note: This means that an aethereal version of a solid object gives out the perceptions of that object via sound, just as its physical version gives out its perceptions as touch, sight, smell.    

<!-- idea-object gives out the perceptions via sound just as its physical object gives out its perceptions as touch, sight,   -->


### Sensory and Motor Organs

Name | Function
--- | ---
1. cakśuh (eye) | darshana (to see)
2. karńa (ear) | shravańa (to hear)
3. násiká (nose) | ághráńa (to smell)
4. jihvá (tongue) | ásvádana (to taste)
5. tvak (skin) | sparshana (to touch)

These help the mind in assimilating the <!-- tanmátras --> quantum-perceptions.

The motor organs <!-- or karmendriyas -->:

Name | Function
--- | ---
1. vák (vocal cord) | kathana (to speak)
2. páńi (hand) | shilpana (to work)
3. páda (leg) | carańa (to move)
4. páyu (anus) | varjana (to let out waste)
5. upastha (genitary organ) | janana (to give birth)


Organ | Passage	| Controlling nerve
--- | --- | ---
Upastha	| Shukra Nád́ii| Aopasthya (controlling genitary organ)
Páyu | Shaunkhinii	| Ashvinii (controlling anus)
_ | Vajráńii | Kuhu (controlling urinary organ)
