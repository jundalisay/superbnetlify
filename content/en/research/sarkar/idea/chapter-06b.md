<!-- ## Paramátman and Atman -->

"Paramátman" [active collective consciousness] is the collective name for the Macrocosmic Nucleus.<!--  Puruśottama -->.

<!-- The resultant force of Prakrti bursts out from one of the vertices of the triangle of forces of Prakrti, and that this is the origin of creation. 

The mid-point of this triangle of forces from whose vertex the bursting occurred is Puruśottama. 

The mid-points of these triangles of forces having bursting vertices coincide, and hence Puruśottama is a singular entity. -->

<!-- Philosophers have defined  -->

<!-- , His prota yoga in saiṋcara and ota and prota yogas in pratisaiṋcara.  -->
- It means “conscious of creations”. 
- It is the consciousness in the Nucleus and the consciousness in the Macrocosm and microcosms.
- It is made up of <!-- The Nucleus --> individual consciousnesses or Átman which is in the unit structure. <!-- is also called kút́astha caetanya. -->

**Macrocosm (Cosmic Mind) and microcosms (unit mind) themselves are not included in Paramátman.** 


## Saguna Brahma

"Saguńa Brahma" is the collectivity of:
- <!-- Paramátman --> Collective Consciousness
- Macrocosm
- microcosms

It is the Brahma in which the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> <!-- appears in --> manifests. <!-- In Saguńa Brahma, Puruśottama is the Nucleus Consciousness and so the latter is also named Kút́astha.  -->



Its controlling station is the ajna chakra <!-- middle point between the eyebrows, the place --> where the functioning of the pituitary gland is located.

<!-- Saiṋcara is movement away from the Nucleus – the Nucleus itself being the centre of Brahma Cakra, or the great cycle of creation. The force of saiṋcara is, therefore, centrifugal. Philosophy refers to this outward movement as domination by Avidyámáyá or illusion of ignorance. Under the effect of Avidyámáyá creation moves from the subtle to the gross, finally reaching the farthest point in saiṋcara where the crudest solid or kśititattva is formed – where the metamorphosed form of the citta possesses the maximum chemical affinity, with no possibility of any further reduction in the intermolecular and interatomic spaces. -->

In the farthest point in crudification, the unit structure of the crudest solid factor <!-- Depending on conditions,  --> either:
- bursts out as <!-- a supernova or --> structural dissociation <!-- at this point or jad́asphot́a occurs -->, or
- the mind is formed by a process of division and association of matter. 

**The formation of mind is the start of subtlification.** 
- This progress is effected by the domination of Vidyámáyá or illusion of knowledge, whereby the direction of motion is towards the Nucleus Puruśottama, the centre of all creations. 
- Every step in this direction is a step nearer the centre, the destined goal of all, the ultimate result of all creations. 
- This force is centripetal and is associated with the growing attraction of the Macrocosmic Nucleus. 
- This attraction is His blessing by which He leads every being of His towards the kindly divine light. 

The associated reflection of the Macrocosmic Nucleus increases the proximity of the unit mind to the Macrocosmic Nucleus. 
- The mind proportionately expands and progresses till the gradual expansion brings about similarity of the microcosm and the Macrocosm and the former gets merged into the latter. 

<!-- This process occurs in pratisaiṋcara under the centripetal force of attraction from the Nucleus Consciousness, Puruśottama. -->

The unit mind, however, can accelerate the speed of this motion by realizing His blessing more and more and thereby acquiring a psycho-spiritual parallelism faster. 


## Sadhana or Meditation

'Sádhaná' is the attempt to:
- accelerate the motion of subtilification, the movement towards the ultimate goal 
- cover up the painful hours of divine separation as early as possible

Only human beings possess the ego to perform this sádhaná. 
- The touchstone of spiritual sádhaná is therefore the feeling that “I am tending towards Him.”

**Every delayed moment of life is only a moment of pain.** 
- Only that which brings His realization is His spiritual practice, all other actions being ritualistic ostentations.

**Consciousness in the psycho-physical unit-structures gets manifested in the process of subtlification when the Macrocosmic Nucleus by His ota yoga associatively reflects on the unit's psychic plate.**
<!--  pratisaiṋcara -->
- He, Ever-Merciful, elevates each creation by the force of Knowledge in the process of subtlification<!-- Vidyámáyá -->.

<!-- It is through this process, pratisaiṋcara, that the  -->

The physical and psychic clash and the attraction of the Great cause psychic dilation. 
- Ultimately the unit psychic body can attain its final liberation or mukti by its spiritual sádhaná. 

Different unit minds exist at different levels and experience varying degrees of His love and proximity depending on their progress in the process of subtilification<!--  pratisaiṋcara -->. 
- Infinite bliss is attained upon liberation wherein all the bondages of Activity are shattered 

<!-- The auspicious day of infinite ánanda descends, and all the bondages of Prakrti shatter down, when Brahmatva is attained. -->

- Such individuals set the ideal for humanity. 
- In turn, humanity starts paying homage to them. 
- Only such elevated beings can and should be called <!-- Mahápuruśa, meaning thereby --> elevated psychic beings.
- Unto their holy feet, one can offer the flowers of devotion and aspiration, but they desire no crude earthly flowers and offerings.
