## The Heart Chakra

The <!-- position of práńendriya is in the --> heart cakra (anáhata) is not in the mechanical heart.  <!-- which palpitates but in the yogic centre of heart, that is, in the middle point of the  cakra. --> It <!-- Práńendriya --> is not listed as a sense-organ <!-- (indriya) --> because:
- its <!-- , not only because its site or --> controlling point is not in the brain
- **it is a layer and not a sense-organ**
  - The job of the 10 sense-organs (indriyas) is only to send and receive <!-- perceive --> quantum-perceptions
  - **The Heart Chakra is the collective name of the 10 vital energies** <!-- váyus -->
<!-- , but in the heart chakra.  different from that of other indriyas, but for another reason as well.  -->

<!-- tattvas -->. 

<!-- , comes under the category of tattvas. -->

The sense-organs <!--  Indriyas, therefore, --> are the activators and perceivers of the 5 layers. 

The heart chakra <!-- bhútatattvas, and práńendriya is more or less --> is a correlated activity of the 10 analysed sub-factors of vital energy-layer<!--  váyutattva -->.

<!-- Práńendriya -->

**The Heart Chakra is the most vital part of the physical and psycho-physical body.** 
- Every activity of the Heart Chakra is pulsative – contracting and expanding<!-- (saḿkoca-vikáshii) -->.
- The auxiliary waves of the Heart Chakra flow in a pulsative way -- there is an arrangement of alternative motions and pauses in their flows. 

It is during **the state of pause and potentiality** that the mindstuff:
- is able to receive the quantum-perceptions<!--  tanmátras -->
- takes the form of shapes represented by those quantum-perceptions<!-- tanmátras -->.

Unless the mindstuff <!-- citta --> takes the form of incoming the quantum-perceptions, <!-- tanmátras --> no perception is possible. 
- **This is because the ego can work only when the mindstuff <!-- citta --> adopts a form.**

This is revealed by analysing a very common experience. 

The mind cannot have any perception if the mindstuff does not receive those quantum-perceptions, even if the afferent nerves are working.

If one eats something while walking or running, one is not able to enjoy the taste fully. 
- This is because the mindstuff is unable to receive the quantum-perceptions


**One is unable to receive and understand an idea <!-- bháva (idea) --> simultaneously with some other physical and mental activity.** 

The secret is the heart chakra <!-- práńendriya -->. 
- **It is able to let all the nerves flow in the pattern in which it itself is flowing.** 

**This means that if heart chakra is dilating then  <!-- stage and not in the contracting one, --> every nerve, along with the mindstuff itself, is also dilating and flowing in the same wavelength.**
<!-- expanding  -->
- The result is that incoming quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> face hindrance and cannot activate the mindstuff<!-- citta -->. 
- Thus, either there is difficulty in perception or there is no perception. 

Therefore, even if all the other factors responsible for perception are working well, the heart chakra in its dilated <!--expansive --> stage will cause the mindstuff <!-- citta --> and nerves to vibrate sympathetically.
- It will hamper the movement of the incoming quantum-perceptions<!-- tanmátras -->. 
- But if the heart chakra is in the controlling position or at a pause, it creates such a calmness throughout the psycho-physical structure that the correct perception is possible.

So actually, the heart chakra plays a vital part in helping the organs indirectly to:
- receive the quantum-perceptions<!--  tanmátras -->, 
- assist the mindstuff to perceive them correctly, and thus
- to let the ego get a deeper understanding of them<!-- have a cognition in that connection. -->


## Pranayama

This is the psycho-philosophy behind the practice of Práńáyáma. 
- Práńáyáma is where the spiritual aspirant <!-- sádhaka --> tries to let this heart chakra remain paused. 
- This lets the paused unit mind merge into the ocean of consciousness just to have the experience of the supramental stratum.

In our daily life, **the experiences of soft and hard, melodious and harsh, hot and cold are being experienced by the sixth organ -- our heart chakra**.
- These are subtler experiences, not coming within the jurisdiction of crude fundamentality<!-- , are felt by the sixth organ – the heart chakra. -->
- These experiences do not come within the scope of the 5 fundamental perceptions of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell<!--  shravańa (hearing), sparshana (feeling by touch), darshana (vision), ashvádana (taste) and ághráńa (smell). -->


**The heart chakra's special function is to recognize the objectivities from different sense-perceptions and innate <!-- psychic --> mental projections.**
- It also works as an auxiliary force in some of the internal mental activities. 

With the help of this heart-chakra <!-- práńendriya --> one feels that:
- a particular person is very kind and affectionate, or
- a particular person is unkind and antipathetic.

Such an experience is based more on a subjective feeling than on any outer objective correlation.

In certain philosophies, "bodhendriya" is also used for the heart chakra. 
- A better word is <!--  for expressing the essence of this indriya shall be --> "bodha vivikti". 
- The other sense-organs<!--  indriyas --> may be called "bodhendriyas".
