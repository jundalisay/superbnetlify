This biological machine is of great help to humans. You can perform spiritual sádhaná with this biological structure because it is a biped structure. 

Bipeds are:
- humans
- orangutans
- chimpanzees
- gorillas. 

Monkeys are also bipeds but they cannot stand erect. They are in between bipeds and quadrupeds. 

By proper training, orangutans will start to enjoy smoking like humans. 
<!-- Have you seen this in the zoo?  -->
- They will smoke cigarettes, break coconuts and drink coconut water. 
- By further training they will easily come closer to humans. 

So these creatures are guided and goaded by biped psychology. 
<!-- (Pedis is Latin and means “concerning the foot”; the [Latinate] adjective is “pedal”. “Pedestrian” means “one who walks with the feet”.)  -->

This is pedal psychology, not human psychology.

The human biological structure and nervous system are more developed than those of other bipeds. 

**Tailless apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas are less developed than human beings because their backbones contain tail bones.** 

The human backbone does bear a tail bone, just at the bottom of the spine. But it curves inside rather than protruding outside the human body. 

The tail of a monkey protrudes outside its body. During the first 4 months of pregnancy, a human foetus begins to develop a tail which grows at the same rate as the body. 

After 4 months, the growth rate of the tail is slower than that of the rest of the body. This continues up to 8 months. 

After 8 months, the tail goes inside the body of the unborn baby and is not externally visible. 

The fetus now has all the features of a human being. 

This is one of the main differences between the biological structure of human beings and that of other bipeds.

If a baby is born prematurely there is a risk that it may die. If the parents live in an isolated rural area and are unable to provide proper medical attention for their baby, it may be wrapped in cotton collected from the shimul tree [silk cotton tree, Bombax ceiba L.] and kept in a wooden cot for 2 months. 

The cotton should be soaked in pure ghee and changed regularly. This simple arrangement will provide a congenial environment for the baby to grow healthy and strong.

Chimpanzees, orang-utans and gorillas are all tailless apes, but their backbones bear larger tail bones inside their bodies than those of human beings. Human beings have only one tail bone inside their bodies, but the tailless apes have more than one, all inside the body, so they cannot stand erect like human beings. 

They have to bend a bit, so their posterior portion is bigger than that of humans. 

The cranium – a container made of bones for the brain – of tailless apes is a bit smaller than that of humans. This is why tailless apes have fewer nerve cells in the brain.

In the case of humans, the fetus' growth rate is faster in the second 4 months of pregnancy. But in the same period, the tail grows at a comparatively slower rate.

In the case of tailless apes, the tail bone continues to grow at the same rate as the fetus. 

After birth, tailless apes have to bend forward to keep balance. 

Animals with tails have to bend still further forward due to the weight of the tail, so they cannot stand for a long time.

Tailless apes, because of the absence of tails, are guided by biped psychology. Animals with tails are also guided by biped psychology, but their brains are smaller. Due to the larger tail, the cranium grows smaller thus the brain grows smaller, and so their psychology will not be the same as that of tailless bipeds.

Tailless apes can be taught sádhaná after some effort. 

The tailed bipeds will not be able to do sádhaná like the tailless bipeds. This is because the backbone of the tailed bipeds contains the controlling points of the 5 fundamental factors. It does not come in one line.

Their controlling points fall on a curved line, hence they cannot perform sádhaná properly.

Mono-sided, straight or erect beings can perform sádhaná very well because all the 5 controlling points of the fundamental factors fall on a straight line. 

In these creatures, the cranium containing the brain is a bit bulky at the back, indicating that the brain is large enough to perform sádhaná easily. 

You see how fortunate you are to have a human biological structure. You have got a human frame. 

**Humans should be obliged to Supreme Consciousness for this favour.**

In the case of tailed bipeds, the front legs [the arms], are not fully utilized for walking. 
- They are used more for catching objects. 

In the case of humans, they are never used for walking.

In the case of monkeys, often they are used for walking as well as catching. 

So, in any case, monkeys can never be equal to humans, even if their tail is severed from the body. 

The body of a monkey will always remain tilted forward. 

So it is a great advantage to have a human body. Sukrtaermánavo bhútvá jiṋániicenmokśamápnuyát [“People are born as human beings due to their past good saḿskáras, but to attain non-qualified liberation they will have to attain self-knowledge.”]

The art of attaining self-knowledge is complete self-surrender. You cannot challenge Parama Puruśa with your intellect and talent. 

You can challenge Him with one thing only. That is, you must say, “Oh, Parama Puruśa, You have brought me to this earth, so You will have to appear before me, because I am in a human body which I have attained by virtue of Your grace.”

Because tailed bipeds have a tail, they can run faster than human beings. 

If the tail is added to the two hind and the two fore legs, tailed bipeds have five legs. 

The four legs are actually supported by the tail, which works as the fifth leg. 

Thus, monkeys can run faster than bipeds. 

If monkeys walk on two legs only like bipeds, they will walk more slowly than human beings. If a monkey walks on 4 legs, it will move faster than a human being. If it takes the help of its tail, it will be able to jump from one tree to another and its speed will be greatly enhanced.

The speed of movement is increased with the help of the lymphatic glands. 

In human beings, the lymphatic glands are located at the joints of the arms and of the legs, and also at various other places. 

Depending on the hormonal secretions of these lymphatic glands, one acquires the capacity to jump. 

Can humans jump as much as monkeys even after strenuous effort? 

Humans cannot even run like them. All this is due to the lymphatic glands. 

When the lymphatic glands in the armpits and leg joints are activated, hairs start to grow in those parts of the human body. If you find an absence of hair, it indicates that the lymphatic glands are underdeveloped, and that the individual will have less jumping capacity.

Suppose a youth begins to run like a monkey using his hands and legs. He continues to run, now imagining he has a tail. Running becomes easier for him.

Suppose his lymphatic glands are activated and running becomes more enjoyable because his lymphatic glands are producing significantly more hormones – not as much as monkeys but much more than ordinary human beings. Biologically he is very close to a monkey.

Suppose his lymphatic glands return to normal. His body feels that it is a bit heavier than it was during the monkey demonstration, and he will not be able to jump as freely. He has become a gentleman again!


Take the example of male and female eunuchs. Generally the cranium of a female is smaller than that of a male. 

If you see the skull of a female skeleton, you will notice that the upper portion of the skull is smaller. Those who are eunuchs by birth have still smaller craniums.

If, by biological processes, a eunuch is transformed into a male or female, he or she will suffer from headaches for the rest of his or her life.

He or she cannot get rid of them because it is due to a shortage of nerve cells in the brain. If a male becomes a female by biological processes, he will not suffer from headaches as such; he will have no difficulty. 

But if a female becomes a male, she will suffer difficulties because the cranium is smaller; that is, the brain is smaller. 

It is a matter of biological importance that humans have done nothing in this direction so far.
