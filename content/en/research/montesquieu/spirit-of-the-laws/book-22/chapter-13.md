The Roman republic devalued their coin by adding alloys because of the unwise spending of their leaders. They even plated or covered cheap metals like copper with a thin plate of silver. This money is mentioned in the 77th book of Dio. 

Didius Julian first began to debase it.

The coin of Caracalla had an alloy of more than half.

The coin of Alexander Severus had 2/3.

The debasing increased until under Gallienus until the silver coin was merely copper silvered over.

<!-- The state reposed in the people the knowledge of its wants; and did not pretend to deceive them.
Under the emperors, they proceeded by way of allay.

These princes were reduced to despair by their liberalities and so were obliged to degrade the specie; an indirect method, which diminished the evil, without seeming to touch it. -->

<!-- They with-held a part of the gift and yet concealed the hand that did it; and, without speaking of the diminution of the pay, or of the gratuity, it was found diminished.

We even still see* in cabinets a kind of medals which are called plated; and are only pieces of copper covered with a thin plate of silver.
 -->
Such violent proceedings cannot happen nowadays. A prince might deceive himself, but he could deceive nobody else. The exchange has taught the banker to compare all the money in the world, and to establish its just value. The standard of money can be no longer a secret.

If the prince plated his copper with silver, everybody would still use it. It would be sent overseas to buy imports and come back as copper. <!--  him; the specie of the true standard would go abroad first, and nothing would be sent back but base metal. -->

If, like the Roman emperors, he debased the silver, without debasing the gold, the gold would suddenly disappear, and he would be reduced to his bad silver.

The exchange, as I have said in the preceding book,* has deprived princes of the opportunity of shewing great exertions of authority, or at least has rendered them ineffectual.
