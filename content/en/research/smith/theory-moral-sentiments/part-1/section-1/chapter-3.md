<!-- We judge the propriety of the feelings of others by our sympathy or lack of sympathy with them -->
### Our own feelings is the measure or decider of our sympathy or non-sympathy with the feelings of others

{{< s v="20" >}} When the feelings of the observee perfectly concords with the observer's sympathies, they appear suitable to the observer. 
- On the contrary, when the observer finds that the observee's feelings do not match his, they appear improper to him.

Therefore, approving another's feelings is the same thing as entirely sympathizing with them.
- Not approving of those feelings is the same thing as not entirely sympathizing with them.

The man who resents the injuries done to me will observe that I also resent them as he does.
- He necessarily approves of my resentment.

The man who sympathizes with my grief, admits the reasonableness of my sorrow.

<!-- He who admires the same poem or picture as much as I do, allows the justness of my admiration.
        He who laughs at the same joke with with me, cannot deny the propriety of my laughter.
    On the contrary, the man has different feelings from mine, disapproves my feelings because of their dissonance with his own.
        I must incur his disapprobation if= 
            my animosity goes beyond the indignation allowed by my friend,
            my grief exceeds what his most tender compassion can go along with,
            my admiration is too high or too low to tally with his own,
            I laugh loudly and heartily when he only smiles, and
            I only smile when he laughs loudly and heartily.
             -->
On all occasions, his own feelings are the standards and measures by which he judges of mine.


{{< s v="21" >}} To approve of another man's opinions is to adopt those opinions.
- To adopt them is to approve of them.

If the same arguments which convince you also convince me, I necessarily approve of your conviction.
- If they do not, I necessarily disapprove of it.
  
<!--         I cannot do the one without the other. -->
Therefore, to approve or disapprove of the opinions of others means to agree or disagree with our own. This is the same with our approval or disapproval of the feelings of others.


{{< s v="22" >}} In some cases, we approve without any correspondence of feelings. The feeling of approval is different from the perception of this correspondence. However, our approval is ultimately founded on this kind of correspondence.
<!--     I shall give a very simple example.

    Simple examples can be less perverted by man's judgments from wrong systems. -->

<!-- We often approve of a joke and think that the group's laughter is proper, though we ourselves do not laugh.  -->

For example, from experience, we know what kind of pleasantry can make us laugh. We hear a joke and see most people laugh. We approve of their laughter, even if we do not laugh ourselves [have no correspondence], because we know that that laugh has pleasant causes [feeling of approval]. 

<!-- others 

We observe that this is one of that kind.

We therefore approve of the group's laughter. 

We feel that it is natural and suitable to its object. Even if we we cannot easily enter into it, we feel that we can heartily join in it. -->



{{< s v="23" >}} The same thing often happens with all the other passions.

A very sad stranger passes by on the street. We are told that he has just heard of his father's death. We do not know him nor his father so we might not have sympathy [no correspondence]. However, we know from experience, that death naturally excites sorrow so we approve of his sorrow.

<!--         It is impossible that we should not approve of his grief.
    Yet we might often be unable to completely sympathize with him.
        Both he and his father can be entirely unknown to us.
        We might be too busy with other things.
        We do not take time to visualize his distress in our imagination.


            We know that if we took time to consider his situation fully, we should sincerely sympathize with him.
    Our approval of his sorrow is founded on the consciousness of this conditional sympathy, even in cases where that sympathy does not actually take place. -->

Our previous experiences of what feelings are proper and improper lead to general moral rules which correct our lack of sympathy. 



<!-- The general rules derived from  our sentiments commonly correspond with, correct the impropriety of our present emotions. -->

### The morality of an action depends on that action's cause (proper/improper) and effect (merit/demerit)

{{< s v="24" >}} The morality of a feeling has two relations*= 
- In relation to its cause or motive that creates the feeling
- In relation to its end or effect which the feeling tends to produce

> *Translator's note=  This is from Hume's double relation of impressions and ideas 



{{< s v="25" >}} An action's propriety or impropriety depends on the suitableness or unsuitableness of the feeling that caused it.

{{< s v="26" >}} An action's merit or demerit depends on the feeling's beneficial or harmful aims.
- A beneficial aim deserves reward
- A harmful aim deserves punishment

{{< s v="27" >}} Philosophers give little attention to the relation of the causes of the affections. In common life, however, we constantly judge any person's conduct and motives under both cause and effect. When we blame another man's excess of love, grief, or resentment, we consider= 
- its ruinous effects and
- the little reason for it.

We say that: 
- his misfortune is not so dreadful to justify such a violent passion, and
- we would approve of his violent emotion if the cause were proportional to it.

{{< s v="28" >}} We use our own feelings to determine whether his feeling is proportional to its cause,  .
- We approve of them if we find them to be suitable
- If otherwise, we disapprove of them

{{< s v="29" >}} Each man measures the faculty of others according to his own faculty. I judge of= 
- your sight by my sight,
- your ear by my ear,
- your reason by my reason,
- your resentment by my resentment, and
- your love by my love.

I do this because I have no other way of judging your faculties.
