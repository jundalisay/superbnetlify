## Justice requires a lowered ego

{{< s v="11" >}} Only the just indignation for evil done to us is the only proper motive for us to= 
- hurt our neighbour and
- incite us to do evil to another 

<!-- person's natural preference for his own happiness above that of others in order to= 
- disturb the happiness of others merely because it stands in the way of our own happiness,
- take useful things from others merely because it may be more useful to us, and
- indulge at the expence of other people. -->

By nature, everyone: 
- is first and principally recommended to his own care
- is fitter to take care of himself than of any other person. 
- prefers his own happiness

But no impartial spectator can go along with this at the expense of the happiness of others.

Every man is more deeply interested in whatever immediately concerns himself, than in what concerns others.  We are more concerned with an insignificant disaster that affects us, than about the death of a person totally unconnected to us. Our neighbour's ruin may affect us much less than our own very small misfortune. But we must not ruin him to prevent our small misfortune or our own ruin. 

As in all other cases, we must view ourselves how we appear to others, not so much according to how we appear to ourselves. There is a proverb= 

{{< quote >}}
Every man may be the whole world to himself. But to others, he is a most insignificant part of it. His own happiness may more important to him than all the world's happiness. But to every other person, it is of no more consequence than that of any other man.
{{< /quote >}}

A person might naturally prefer himself to others. But he does not tell others this because he knows that they will never go along with it. 

When he views himself as how others will view him, he sees himself no better than the others. To make others have sympathy with him, **he must humble his ego to something which others can go along with**.
<!--  self-love, as on all other occasions -->
<!-- - bring his self-love down  -->
<!-- - how natural soever it may be to him, it must always appear excessive and extravagant to them -->

<!--  to them,  but one of the multitude . If he wants the impartial spectator to enter into the principles of his conduct, which he has the greatest desire to do, he  -->
They will then indulge his ego so far as to= 
- let him be more anxious about his own happiness
- pursue his happiness with more earnest attention

<!-- Thus, whenever they place themselves in his situation, they will readily go along with him.  -->

He may run as hard as he can for wealth and honours against his competitors. <!-- He can strain every nerve and muscle to outstrip all his competitors.  -->

But if he should throw down any of them, the sympathy of others will end as his action violates fair play, which they cannot go with. They transfer their sympathy with the natural resentment of the injured. 

<!-- The offender becomes the object of their hatred and indignation. He is sensible that he becomes so and feels that those feelings are ready to burst out from all sides against him. -->
<!-- To them, the other man is as good as he. They do not enter into his self-love. -->


{{< s v="12" >}} The sufferer's resentment becomes stronger the greater and more irreparable the evil done. <!-- Likewise, the spectators' sympathetic indignation and the agent's sense of guilt runs higher. --> 

The most sacred laws are: 
1. Those which protect life - all humans are guaranteed to be living
2. Those which protect property and possessions - these are the things that we already have 
3. Those which protect rights and contracts - these are things that are expected to come

Death is the greatest evil which one man can inflict on another. It excites the strongest resentment in those immediately connected with the slain. This is why murder is the most atrocious of all crimes. 

To be deprived of that which we have, is a greater evil than to be disappointed of what we could have had. This is why breach of property, theft, and robbery, <!-- which , --> are greater crimes than breach of contract. The former take from us what we have, while the latter only extinguishes our expectation. 

<!-- Thus, the laws which protect life are the most sacred, and those which guard protect property and possessions are the next most sacred. The last most sacred are those which protect personal rights.

## Remorse

{{< s v="13" >}} After the passion of the violator of justice is gratified, he begins to reflect on his past conduct. It now appears as detestable to him as to other people.

<!--  can never reflect on the people's feelings without feeling shame, horror, and consternation. 
 is  He then can no longer enter into the motives which influenced it.  -->

He starts to hate himself is he sympathizes with the hatred from others. He feels that he is now the proper object of= 
- mankind's resentment
- vengeance and punishment, which are the natural consequences of resentment

<!-- for him, he becomes the object of his own hatred. The person who suffered by his injustice now calls on his pity. He is grieved at the thought of it. He regrets the unhappy effects of his own conduct.  -->

The thought of this perpetually haunts him. He would rather fly to some inhospitable desert, where no one knows the condemnation of his crimes. But the horror of solitude drives him back into society where he is loaded with shame and distracted with fear. <!-- , in order to supplicate some protection from those very judges, who he knows have already condemned him. -->

<!-- He dares not look at society in the face. He imagines himself as it were rejected and thrown out from the affections of all mankind. He cannot hope for sympathy in this. The remembrance of his crimes has shut out all fellow-feeling from his fellow-creatures. He is most afraid of their feelings for him. -->
<!-- Everything seems hostile. -->
 

<!-- But solitude is still more dreadful than society.
His own thoughts present him only with what is melancholy, unfortunate, and disastrous. -->
<!-- , the  forebodings of incomprehensible misery and ruin. -->
 
<!-- He comes again into the presence of mankind.
He is astonished to appear before them. -->

Such a feeling is called 'remorse'. It is the most dreadful of the feelings and is made up of= 
- shame from the <!-- sense of the impropriety of --> past conduct,
- grief for its effects,
- pity for those who suffer by it, and
- the dread of punishment from others
<!-- the consciousness of the justly provoked resentment of all rational creatures. -->


## Deserved Reward

{{< s v="14" >}}  <!-- The opposite behaviour naturally inspires the opposite feeling.  -->The man who has done a generous action from proper motives feels himself as the natural object of: 
- his beneficiaries' love and gratitude, and
- mankind's esteem by their sympathy with his beneficiaries.

When he looks back at his motives as an indifferent spectator, he applauds himself by sympathy with this impartial judge. In both these points of view, his own conduct is agreeable to himself. This fills him with cheerfulness, serenity, and composure. <!-- He is in friendship and harmony with all mankind. --> 
<!-- He looks on his fellow-creatures with confidence and benevolent satisfaction. He is secure that he has rendered himself worthy of their most favourable regards.  -->

Such a feeling is called 'the consciousness of merit' or 'deserved reward'.
