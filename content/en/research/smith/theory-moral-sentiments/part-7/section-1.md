{{< s v="1" >}} Almost all of the remarkable theories on the nature of our moral feelings are partly correct and partly wrong due to their imperfect view of nature.

<!-- Every reputable system of morality is ultimately derived from some of those principles I have mentioned.
In this respect, all of them are founded on natural principles.
They are all in some measure in the right.
But many of them are derived from an .
So many of them are also in the wrong. -->

{{< s v="2" >}} There are two questions regarding moral principles:

1. What is their definition of virtue?
2. What is the conduct that makes up the praise-worthy character?
  - This character is the natural object of esteem, honour, and approbation.
  - By what faculty in the mind recommends this character to us?
  - How does the mind= 
    - prefer one conduct to another?
    - denominates the one right and the other wrong?
 
3 The first question leads to virtue-based moral systems.
- Dr. Hutcheson's system is based on benevolence
- Dr. Clarke's system is based on acting suitably to our situation
- The system of others is based on the wise and prudent pursuit of our own real happiness
 
4 The second question leads to moral systems that derive virtue from= 
- self-love
  - This leads to moral systems based on private interest.
- reason
  - This compares characters, similar to the comparison between truth and falsehood.
- a moral sense, which is pleased by this virtuous character and displeased by the contrary one
- some other principle in human nature, such as a modification of sympathy, or the like.
