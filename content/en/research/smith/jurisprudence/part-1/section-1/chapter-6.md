We have considered:
- how the dissolution of small states was brought about, and
- what form of government succeeded them,
- how an imperial government was introduced into conquering republics, and
- what kind of administration this was.

How was this military monarchy was dissolved?<!-- , like every state and constitution. -->

Rome's arts and commerce improved under their imperial government. 
- This made them less fond of going out to war. <!-- - The people become acquainted with arts, commerce and consequently, domestic luxury. -->
- The government found that it would hurt its revenue to call out those employed in manufactures. 

If barbarous nations were near, they can employ them as soldiers at an easier rate.
- At the same time, it would not hurt their own industry.
- And so the Romans recruited their armies in Germany, Britain, and the northern barbarous countries which bordered on the Roman Empire.
  - They recruited in those countries in the same way that the Dutch did in Scotland before the beginning of the last war1.

After this practice was established, they would find it easier to= 
- make a bargain with the barbarous chieftains who worked for them and
- give him so much money to lead out men to expeditions.
 
The barbarous chieftain thus possessed the whole military authority. 
<!--  of the people for whom he fought. -->
- Whenever the Romans offended him, he could turn his arms against those Romans<!--  who employed him, and make himself master of their country. -->

All the western provinces were taken possession of much in this way.
<!-- After they had by their practice given such invitations to the inroad of barbarians, we find that most of the Roman provinces were infested by them. -->

The Romans built a wall and kept garrisons to secure their province from the pillagers of the north*. But these were called away to defend Gaul, which at that time was also infested.

The Britons became free from the Roman yoke when they invited Hengist and Hursa and their considerable army to drive away the Romans1. This led to the Saxon Heptarchy and ended Rome's military monarchy

<!-- But it could be no advantage to the Romans to give any country in Britain its liberty.
It was no favour done it to have no protection from Rome, which the province in reality wanted to have continued.
The Romans meant that they should defend themselves, as they were, for some time, to be otherwise employed.
However, the Britons did not like the proposal.
They resolved to invite a body of Saxons to their relief. -->


<!-- They found themselves masters of the whole country.
They took possession of it and founded the .
The Western European Empire in this way.
 came to ruin. -->

In the last 150 years of the Roman Empire, this custom of recruiting in barbarous nations was continued.

<!-- Many of their chieftains had greatly raised themselves.
Patricius Ã†lias1 under Honorius, and many others, acquired great power. -->

In the same way, all the Asiatic governments were dissolved. Their soldiers were hired from Tartary, arts and manufactures were carried on, the people made more by their trades than by going to war.

The East India trade which Italy and some other nations carried on by the Red Sea had rendered them very opulent. Every nation as well as Rome was willing to make a bargain with the neighbouring barbarous princes to defend them. This destroyed their government.
