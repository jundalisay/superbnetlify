## The Increase in Bank Notes Representing Precious Metals Does Not Increase Inflation

{{< s v="95" >}} A paper money made up of bank notes is equal in value to gold and silver money when it is:
- issued by people of undoubted credit,
- payable on demand without any condition,
- always readily paid as soon as presented, and
- equal in value to gold and silver, since gold and silver money can be had for it at any time.

<!-- Whatever is bought or sold for such paper must be bought or sold as cheap as it could have been for gold and silver. -->

{{< s v="96" >}} The increase of paper money* is said to:
- <!-- increases the amount of currency and  -->reduce the value of currency, and
- increase the money price of commodities.

> *Superphysics Note: The increase of paper money here is the increased subdivision of metal value into smaller values such as 5 or 10 shillings, as opposed to large pound values. In modern speak, it means the creation of more pennies instead of $100 bills. It follows that if all $100 bills were converted to their penny-equivalents for easier small transactions, then inflation will not be affected.


**In reality, paper money does not necessarily increase the amount of currency, because the gold and silver removed from the currency is always equal to the paper added to it.**

<!-- provisions were -->
From the start of the 17th century to 1776, food prices were cheapest in Scotland in 1759.
- In 1759, there was more paper money than now, from the circulation of 10 and 5 shilling bank notes.
- The great multiplication of banks in Scotland began in 1749.

But the proportion between <!-- the price of provisions -->food prices in Scotland and England is the same now in 1776 as before 1749. 
- In addition, wheat is fully as cheap in England as in France even if there is more paper money in England and scarce any in France.

In 1751 and 1752 <!-- , when Mr. Hume published his Political Discourses and --> after the great multiplication of paper money in Scotland, the price of food probably rose due to the badness of the seasons.
- It was not from the multiplication of paper money.
