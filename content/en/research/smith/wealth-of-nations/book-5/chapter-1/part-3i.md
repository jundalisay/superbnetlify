{{< s v="104" >}} Joint stock companies established by royal charter or by act of parliament differ from:
- regulated companies and
- private copartneries.

{{< s v="105" >}} 1. In a private copartnery, a partner needs the consent of the company to: 
- transfer his share to another person,
- introduce a new member into the company.

Upon proper warning, each member may: 
- withdraw from the copartnery, and
- demand payment for his share of the common stock from the copartnery.


In a joint stock company, on the contrary, each member:
- cannot demand payment for his share from the company
- can, without the company's consent:
  - transfer his share to another person, and
  - introduce a new member.

**The value of a share in a joint stock is always its market price. This is different from the stated value in the stock of the company.**



{{< s v="106" >}} 2. In a private co-partnery, each partner is bound for the debts of the company to the extent of his fortune.

In a joint stock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the extent of his share.



{{< s v="107" >}} The joint stock company's <!-- trade --> business is always managed by an executive board (court of directors)<!-- court of directors --> which is managed by a board of investors <!-- directors --> (court of proprietors).
<!-- - The  is frequently subject to a  []. -->

But most of those investors <!-- proprietors --> seldom pretend to understand the company's business.
- When the spirit of faction does not prevail among them, they give no trouble about it.
- They are content to receive yearly dividends as the executives <!-- directors --> think proper to give to them.

**This total exemption from trouble and risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies.** *

> *Superphysics Note: The joint principles of laziness and managed risk or safety leads to the huge size of corporations



They would never hazard their fortunes in any private co-partnery. Thus, joint stock companies draw more stocks than any private co-partnery.
- The South Sea Company's trading stock at one time amounted to more than £33,800,000.
- The Bank of England's divided capital [a joint stock?] is presently £10,780,000.

The <!-- directors --> executives of such companies are the managers of other people's money.
- **They cannot be expected to watch over it with the same vigilance as the partners in a private co-partnery.**
- They are like the stewards of a rich man.
  - They think that attending to small matters are not for their master's honour.
  - They very easily exempt themselves from attending to such matters.
- Negligence and profusion, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.

Joint stock companies for foreign trade seldom were able to compete against private adventurers.
- They very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege.
- They frequently have not succeeded even with an exclusive privilege.
- Without an exclusive privilege they commonly mismanaged the trade.
- With an exclusive privilege they both mismanaged and confined it.
