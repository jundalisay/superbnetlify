Past and present tenses are used as if the current date is February 1773 for Book 1, January 1775 for Book 5, and year is 1784 for the rest of the books.

- Whenever possible, the actual year (e.g. 1350) is used instead of the regnal year (e.g. 25th of Edward 3rd).
- Quotes in green text are profound statements by Adam Smith
- Quotes in bold green text are maxims or very important ideas. A sentence is treated as a maxim if a thought is repeated by Smith with authority (such as his definition of real value) and if Smith indicates it as such ("It may be treated as a maxim that..").
- Lines in brown lines are statements from other writers
- Lines in bold black are subheadings for a series of paragraphs about a certain idea
- The word 'seems' have been simplified to 'is', to convey certainty.
- 'Perhaps' and 'probably' has been maintained to convey less certainty.
- 'Cultivation and improvement' has been interchangeably used.
- 'Cultivation' is preferred to mean non-intensive or recurring or short term improvements  (as in annual agricultural cultivation)
- 'Improvement' is preferred to mean intensive or permanent or long term improvement (as in public works or those sensible over many years or centuries)

Things and concepts that are antiquated such as a 'coach-and-six' has been replaced with its modern equivalent 'luxury coach'.
Some antiquated events such as the silver trade in China, has been replaced with modern examples, such as modern currency trade.
