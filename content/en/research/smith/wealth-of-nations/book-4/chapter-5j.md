Seasticks  	378347 	Bounty at a medium for each barrel of seasticks 	£. 	0 	8 	2¼

But a barrel of seasticks being only reckoned 2/3 of a barrel fully packed, 1/3 is deducted 1/3 deducted 	126115 2/3 	which brings the bounty to 	£. 	0 	12 	3¾ Barrels full packed, 	252231 1/3
And if the herrings are exported, there is besides a premium of 		0 	2 	8
			
So that the bounty paid by Government in money for each barrel, is. 	£ 	0 	14 	11 ¾
But if to this, the duty of the salt usually taken credit for as expended in curing each barrel, which at a medium is of foreign, one bushel and 1/4 of a bushel, at 10 s. a bushel, be added, namely=  		0 	12 	6
			
The bounty on each barrel would amount to 	£ 	1 	7 	5 ¾
			
If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand thus, namely= 
Bounty as before 	£. 	0 	14 	11 ¾
—but if to this bounty the duty on two bushels of Scots salt at 1 s. 6 d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel is added, to wit, 		0 	3 	0
			
The bounty on each barrel will amount to 	£. 	0 	17 	11 ¾
And,
When buss herrings are entered for home consumption in Scotland, and pay the shilling a barrel of duty, the bounty stands thus, to wit, as before 	£ 	0 	12 	3 ¾
From which the 1 s. a barrel is to be deducted 		0 	1 	0
			
		0 	11 	3 ¾
But to that there is to be added again, the duty of the foreign salt used in curing a barrel of herrings, viz.. 		0 	12 	6
			
So that the premium allowed for each barrel of herrings entered for home consumption is 	£. 	1 	3 	9 ¾
			
If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand as follows, viz.
Bounty on each barrel brought in by the busses as above 	£. 	0 	12 	3 ¾
From which deduct the 1 s. a barrel paid at the time they are entered for home consumption 		0 	1 	0
			
	£. 	0 	11 	3 ¾
But if to the bounty the duty on two bushels of Scots salt at 1 s. 6 d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel, is added, to wit 		0 	3 	0
			
The premium for each barrel entered for home consumption will be 	£. 	0 	14 	3 ¾
Though the loss of duties upon herrings exported cannot, perhaps, properly be considered as bounty; that upon herrings entered for home consumption certainly may.
