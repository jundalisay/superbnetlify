## Flat Earth

Before this system was taught in the world, the earth was regarded as a vast and irregular plain, surrounded on allsides by the ocean.
<!-- the basis and foundation of the universe,  -->
- Its roots extended infinitely deep
- The sky was as a solid hemisphere, which covered the earth, and united with the ocean at the extremity of the horizon.
- The Earth was surrounded by the elements of Air and Ether, and covered by 8 polished and cristalline Spheres, each of which was distinguished by one or more beautiful and luminous bodies. These revolved around their common centre, by varied but equable proportionable motions. 

<!--  through the whole of that
infinite depth which is below it.  -->

The Sun, the Moon, and all the heavenly bodies rose out of the eastern, climbed up the convex
side of the heavens, and descended again into the western ocean. 

From there, by some subterraneous passages, returned to their first chambers in the east. 

<!-- Nor was this notion confined to the people, or to the poets who painted the opinions of the people. -->

This was believed by:
- Xenophanes, the founder of the Eleatic philosophy
- after that of the Ionian and Italian schools, the earliest that appeared in Greece. 
- Thales of Miletus too, who, according to Aristotle, represented the Earth as floating upon an immense ocean of water

<!-- Plutarch and Apuleius concerning his astronomical discoveries, all of which must
plainly have been of a much later date.  -->

<!-- To those who had no other idea of nature, besides what they derived from so confused an account of things, how agreeable must that system have appeared, which represented the Earth as distinguished into land and water, self–balanced and suspended in the centre of the universe, surrounded by the -->

The beauty of this system:
- gave to Plato the notion of a harmonic proportion hidden in the motions and distances of the heavenly bodies.
- suggested to the earlier Pythagoreans the celebrated fancy of the Music of the Spheres
  - This is a wild and romantic idea

<!-- , yet such as does not ill correspond with that admiration, which so beautiful a system, recommended too by the graces of novelty, is apt to inspire. -->

<!-- Whatever are the defects which this account of things labours under, they are such, as to the first observers of the heavens could not readily occur. If all the motions of the 5 Planets cannot, the greater part of them may, be easily connected by it; 

They and all their motions are the least remarkable objects in the heavens; the greater part of mankind take no notice of them at all; and a system, whose only defect lies in the account which it gives of them, cannot thereby be much disgraced in their opinion. 

If some of the appearances too of the Sun and Moon, the sometimes accelerated and again retarded motions of those luminaries but ill correspond with it; these too, are such as cannot be discovered but by the most attentive observation, and such therefore as we cannot wonder that the imaginations of the first enquirers should slur over, if one may say so, and take little notice of. -->


Eudoxus was the friend and auditor of Plato. He wanted to remedy the defects in the motions of the Spheres by increasing the number of Spheres. 
- He gave 4 spheres to each planet
  <!-- - 1 was for the sun
  - 3 was for above it -->

Aristotle added 22 more, to increase the number of Spheres to 56.

In the 16th century, Fracostorio increased this number of 72 but even that was not enough. 



## The System of Eccentric Spheres and Epicycles

Not long after Aristotle, Apollonius invented the System of Eccentric Spheres. This was perfected by Hipparchus, and has since been delivered down to us by Ptolemy.

sometimes observed to advance forward in that eastward course which is peculiar to
itself, sometimes to retire backwards, and sometimes again to stand still. To suppose
that the Sphere of the Planet should by its own motion, if one may say so, sometimes
roll forwards, sometimes roll backwards, and sometimes do neither the one nor the
other, is contrary to all the natural propensities of the imagination, which accompanies with ease and delight any regular and orderly motion, but feels itself perpetually stopped and interrupted, when it endeavours to attend to one so desultory and uncertain. It would pursue, naturally and of its own accord, the direct or progressive movement of the Sphere, but is every now and then shocked, if one may say so, and turned violently out of its natural career by the retrograde and stationary appearances
of the Planet, betwixt which and its more usual motion, the fancy feels a want of
connection, a gap or interval, which it cannot fill up, but by supposing some chain of

revolving in the heavens, besides those in which the luminous bodies themselves were
infixed, was the chain with which Eudoxus endeavoured to supply it. He bestowed four
of these Spheres upon each of the Five Planets; one in which the luminous body itself
revolved, and three others above it. Each of these had a regular and constant, but a
peculiar movement of its own, which it communicated to what was properly the Sphere
of the Planet, and thus occasioned that diversity of motions observable in those bodies.

like the circular
One of these Spheres, for example, had an oscillatory motion,
pendulum of a watch. As when you turn round a watch, like a Sphere upon its axis, the
pendulum will, while turned round along with it, still continue to oscillate, and
communicate to whatever body is comprehended within it, both its own oscillations and
the circular motion of the watch; so this oscillating Sphere, being itself turned round by
the motion of the Sphere above it, communicated to the Sphere below it, that circular,
as well as its own oscillatory motion; produced by the one, the daily revolutions; by the
other, the direct, stationary, and retrograde appearances of the Planet, which derived
from a third Sphere that revolution by which it performed its annual period. The motions
of all these Spheres were in themselves constant and equable, such as the imagination
could easily attend to and pursue, and which connected together that otherwise
incoherent diversity of movements observable in the Sphere of the Planet. The motions
of the Sun and Moon being more regular than those of the Five Planets, by assigning
three Spheres to each of them, Eudoxus imagined he could connect together all the
diversity of movements discoverable in either. The motion of the Fixed Stars being
perfectly regular, one Sphere he judged sufficient for them all. So that, according to this
account, the whole number of Celestial Spheres amounted to twenty–seven. Callippus,
though somewhat younger, the cotemporary of Eudoxus, found that even this number
was not enough to connect together the vast variety of movements which he discovered

observers discovered still new motions, and new inequalities, in the heavens. New
Spheres were therefore still to be added to the system, and some of them to be placed
even above that of the Fixed Stars. So that in the sixteenth century, when

inaccurately with the phaenomena, endeavoured to revive this ancient Astronomy,

he found it necessary
which had long given place to that of Ptolemy and Hipparchus,
to multiply the number of Celestial Spheres to seventy–two; neither were all these
enough.

This system had now become as intricate and complex as those appearances
themselves, which it had been invented to render uniform and coherent. The
imagination, therefore, found itself but little relieved from that embarrassment, into
which those appearances had thrown it, by so perplexed an account of things. Another
system, for this reason, not long after the days of Aristotle, was invented by
19
which was afterwards perfected by Hipparchus, and has since been

This system first distinguish between the real and apparent motion of the heavenly bodies. 

These, they observed, upon account of their immense distance, must necessarily appear to revolve in circles concentric with the globe of the Earth, and with one another.

But that we cannot, therefore, be certain that they really revolve in such circles, since, though they did not, they would still have the same appearance. 

By supposing, therefore, that the Sun and the other Planets revolved in circles, whose centres were very distant from the centre of the Earth; that consequently, in the progress of their revolution, they must sometimes approach nearer, and sometimes recede further from it, and must, therefore, to its inhabitants appear to move faster in the one case, and slower in the other, those philosophers imagined they could account for the apparently unequal velocities of all those bodies.

By supposing, that in the solidity of the Sphere of each of the Five Planets there was formed another little Sphere, called an Epicycle, which revolved round its own centre, at the same time that it was carried round the centre of the Earth by the revolution of the great Sphere, betwixt whose concave and convex sides it was inclosed; in the same manner as we might suppose a little wheel inclosed within the outer circle of a great wheel, and which whirled about several times upon its own axis, while its centre was carried round the axis of the great wheel, they imagined they could account for the
retrograde and stationary appearances of those most irregular objects in the heavens.

The Planet, they supposed, was attached to the circumference, and whirled round the at the same time that it was carried round the Earth by centre of this little Sphere,
the movement of the great Sphere. 

The revolution of this little Sphere, or Epicycle, was such, that the Planet, when in the upper part of it; that is, when furthest off and least
sensible to the eye; was carried round in the same direction with the centre of the
Epicycle, or with the Sphere in which the Epicycle was inclosed: but when in the lower
part, that is, when nearest and most sensible to the eye; it was carried round in a
direction contrary to that of the centre of the Epicycle: in the same manner as every
point in the upper part of the outer circle of a coach–wheel revolves forward in the same
direction with the axis, while every point, in the lower part, revolves backwards in a
contrary direction to the axis. The motions of the Planet, therefore, surveyed from the
Earth appeared direct, when in the upper part of the Epicycle, and retrograde, when in
the lower. When again it either descended from the upper part to the lower, or
ascended from the lower to the upper, it necessarily appeared stationary.

But, though, by the eccentricity of the great Sphere, they were thus able, in some
measure, to connect together the unequal velocities of the heavenly bodies, and by the
revolutions of the little Sphere, the direct, stationary, and retrograde appearances of the
Planets, there was another difficulty that still remained. Neither the Moon, nor the 3 superior Planets, appear always in the same part of the heavens, when at their periods
of most retarded motion, or when they are supposed to be at the greatest distance from
the Earth. The apogeum therefore, or the point of greatest distance from the Earth, in
the Spheres of each of those bodies, must have a movement of its own, which may
carry it successively through all the different points of the Ecliptic. They supposed,
therefore, that while the great eccentric Sphere revolved eastwards round its centre,
that its centre too revolved westwards in a circle of its own, round the centre of the
Earth, and thus carried its apogeum through all the different points of the Ecliptic.
12
But with all those combined and perplexed circles; though the patrons of this system
were able to give some degree of uniformity to the real directions of the Planets, they
found it impossible so to adjust the velocities of those supposed Spheres to the
phaenomena, as that the revolution of any one of them, when surveyed from its own
centre, should appear perfectly equable and uniform. From that point, the only point in
which the velocity of what moves in a circle can be truly judged of, they would still
appear irregular and inconstant, and such as tended to embarrass and confound the
imagination. They invented, therefore, for each of them, a new Circle, called the
Equalizing Circle, from whose centre they should all appear perfectly equable: that is,
they so adjusted the velocities of these Spheres, as that, though the revolution of each
of them would appear irregular when surveyed from its own centre, there should,
however, be a point comprehended within its circumference, from whence its motions
should appear to cut off, in equal times, equal portions of the Circle, of which that point
was the centre.

Nothing can more evidently show, how much the repose and tranquillity of the imagination is the ultimate end of philosophy, than the invention of this Equalizing Circle. 

The motions of the heavenly bodies had appeared inconstant and irregular, both in their velocities and in their directions. They were such, therefore, as tended to embarrass and confound the imagination, whenever it attempted to trace them. 

The invention of Eccentric Spheres, of Epicycles, and of the revolution of the centres of the Eccentric Spheres, tended to allay this confusion, to connect together those disjointed appearances, and to introduce harmony and order into the mind’s conception of the movements of those bodies. 

It did this, however, but imperfectly; it introduced uniformity and coherence into their real directions. But their velocities, when surveyed from the only point in which the velocity of what moves in a Circle can be truly judged of, the centre of that Circle, still remained, in some measure, inconstant as before; and still, therefore, embarrassed the imagination. The mind found itself somewhat relieved from this embarrassment, when it conceived, that how irregular soever the motions of
each of those Circles might appear, when surveyed from its own centre, there was,
however, in each of them, a point, from whence its revolution would appear perfectly
equable and uniform, and such as the imagination could easily follow.

Those philosophers transported themselves, in fancy, to the centres of these imaginary Circles, and took pleasure in surveying from thence, all those fantastical motions, arranged, according to that harmony and order, which it had been the end of all their researches to bestow upon them. Here, at last, they enjoyed that tranquillity and repose which they had pursued through all the mazes of this intricate hypothesis; and here they beheld this, the most beautiful and magnificent part of the great theatre of nature, so disposed and constructed, that they could attend, with ease and delight, to all the revolutions and  changes that occurred in it.
