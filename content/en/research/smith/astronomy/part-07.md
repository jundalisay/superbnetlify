In Italy, the unfortunate Galileo added so many probabilities to the system of Copernicus.

In Germany, Kepler corrected and improved it.

Kepler had great genius but none of the taste or order and method of Galileo.

Like other Germans, he was a hard worker who had an excessive passion for discovering proportions and resemblances between the different parts of nature.

He had been instructed, by Micheal Maestlin in the system of Copernicus. He wondered:
- why there were 6 planets
- why they were at such irregular distances from the Sun
- whether there was any uniform proportion between their distances, and the timespan of their revolution

He tried to find it in:
- the proportions of numbers and plain figures,
- then in those of the regular solids,
- finally, in those of the musical divisions of the Octave. 

Whatever the science Kepler was studying, he seems constantly to have pleased himself with finding some analogy and thus, arithmetic and music, plain and between it and the system of the universe. 

Solid geometry, came all of them by turns to illustrate the doctrine of the Sphere, in the explaining of which he was, by his profession, principally employed. 


He had presented one of his books to Tycho Brahe who disapproved of his system. But Tycho was pleased with Kepler's genius and diligence in making the most laborious calculations.

Brahe invited the obscure and indigent Kepler to come and live with him as soon as he arrived.

He employed Kepler to observe, arrange, and methodize Mars.
<!-- , in the  of which his disciples were at that time employed.  -->

Kepler, upon comparing them with one another, found that:
- Mars' orbit was an ellipse with the Sun as one of its foci. 
- Mars' motion was not equable
  - It was swiftest when nearest the Sun and slowest when farthest from it
  - Its velocity gradually encreased, or diminished, according as it approached or receded from it. 

He found that these 2 facts were true for all the other Planets.

<!--  -- their orbits were elliptical, and their motions were swiftest when nearest the Sun, and slowest when furthest from him. They showed the same things, too, of the
Sun, if supposed to revolve round the Earth; and consequently of the Earth, if supposed
76
to revolve round the Sun.
51
That the motions of all the heavenly bodies were perfectly circular, had been the
fundamental idea, upon which every astronomical hypothesis, except the irregular one
of the Stoics, had been built. --> 

<!-- A circle, as the degree of its curvature is every where the

same, is of all curve lines the simplest and the most easily conceived.
evident, therefore, that the heavenly bodies did not move in strait lines, the indolent
imagination found, that it could most easily attend to their motions if they were
supposed to revolve in perfect circles. It had, upon this account, determined that a
circular motion was the most perfect of all motions, and that none but the most perfect
motion could be worthy of such beautiful and divine objects; and it had upon this
account, so often, in vain, endeavoured to adjust to the appearances, so many different
78
systems, which all supposed them to revolve in this manner.
52
The equality of their motions was another fundamental idea, which, in the same
manner, and for the same reason, was supposed by all the founders of astronomical
systems. For an equal motion can be more easily attended to, than one that is
continually either accelerated or retarded. All inconstancy, therefore, was declared to be
unworthy those bodies which revolved in the celestial regions, and to be fit only for
inferior and sublunary things. --> 


**The calculations of Kepler destroyed the circular orbits of the planets.** 

<!-- and introduced into their real motions, such an inequality as no equalizing circle would
remedy. It was, however, to render their motions perfectly equable, without even the assistance of an equalizing circle, that Copernicus, as he himself assures us, had originally invented his system. Since the calculations of Kepler, therefore, overturned what Copernicus had principally in view in establishing his system, we cannot wonder
that they should at first seem rather to embarrass than improve it.

It is true, by these elliptical orbits and unequal motions, Kepler disengaged the system
from the embarrassment of those small Epicycles, which Copernicus, in order to connect
the seemingly accelerated and retarded movements of the Planets with their supposed
had been obliged to leave in it. For it is remarkable, that though
real equality,
Copernicus had delivered the orbits of the Planets from the enormous Epicycles of
Hipparchus, that though in this consisted the great superiority of his system above that
of the ancient astronomers, he was yet obliged, himself, to abandon, in some measure,
this advantage, and to make use of some small Epicycles, to join together those
seeming irregularities. His Epicycles indeed, like the irregularities for whose sake they
were introduced, were but small ones, and the imaginations of his first followers seem,
accordingly, either to have slurred them over altogether, or scarcely to have observed
them. Neither Galileo, nor Gassendi, the two most eloquent of his defenders, take any
notice of them. Nor does it seem to have been generally attended to, that there was any
such thing as Epicycles in the system of Copernicus, till Kepler, in order to vindicate his
own elliptical orbits, insisted, that even, according to Copernicus, the body of the Planet
was to be found but at two different places in the circumference of that circle which the
center of its Epicycle described.
 -->

An ellipse is, of all curves lines after a circle, the simplest and most easily conceived. 

Kepler took from the motion of the Planets the easiest of all proportions, that of equality, he did not leave them absolutely without one, but ascertained the rule by which their velocities continually varied; for a genius so fond of analogies, when he had taken away one, would be sure to substitute another in its room.

Notwithstanding all this, notwithstanding that his system was better supported by observations than any system had ever been before, yet, such was the attachment to the equal motions and circular orbits of the Planets, that it seems, for some time, to have been in general but little attended to by the learned, to have been altogether neglected by philosophers, and not much regarded even by astronomers.

Gassendi <!-- was not an astronomer but --> began to become famous during the latter days of Kepler. But he <!-- , and who
was himself no mean astronomer, seems indeed to have conceived a good deal of
esteem for his diligence and accuracy in accommodating the observations of Tycho
Brahe to the system of Copernicus. -->

did not understand the importance of Kepler's alterations to that of Tycho Brahe. 

<!-- which Kepler had made in that system, as is evident from his scarcely ever mentioning them in the whole course of his voluminous writings upon Astronomy. 

Descartes was the cotemporary and rival of Gassendi, seems to have paid no attention to them at all, but to have built his Theory of the Heavens without any regard to them. 

Even those astronomers, whom a serious attention had convinced of the justness of his corrections, were still so enamoured with the circular orbits and equal motions, that they endeavoured to compound his system
with those ancient, but natural prejudices. Thus, Ward

endeavoured to show that,

though the Planets moved in elliptical orbits, which had the Sun in one of their foci, and
though their velocities in the elliptical line were continually varying, yet, if a ray was
supposed to be extended from the center of any one of them to the other focus, and to
be carried along by the periodical motion of the Planet, it would make equal angles in
equal times, and consequently cut off equal portions of the circle of which that other
focus was the center. To one, therefore, placed in that focus, the motion of the Planet
would appear to be perfectly circular and perfectly equable, in the same manner as in
who censured this
the Equalizing Circles of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. Thus Bouillaud,
hypothesis of Ward, invented another of the same kind, infinitely more whimsical and
capricious. The Planets, according to that astronomer, always revolve in circles; for that
being the most perfect figure, it is impossible they should revolve in any other. No one
of them, however, continues to move in any one circle, but is perpetually passing from
one to another, through an infinite number of circles, in the course of each revolution;
for an ellipse, said he, is an oblique section of a cone, and in a cone, betwixt the two
85
of the ellipse there is an infinite number of circles, out of the infinitely small
vertices
portions of which the elliptical line is compounded. The Planet, therefore, which moves
in this line, is, in every point of it, moving in an infinitely small portion of a certain
circle. The motion of each Planet, too, according to him, was necessarily, for the same
reason, perfectly equable. An equable motion being the most perfect of all motions. It
was not, however, in the elliptical line, that it was equable, but in any one of the circles
that were parallel to the base of that cone, by whose section this elliptical line had been
formed=  for, if a ray was extended from the Planet to any one of those circles, and
carried along by its periodical motion, it would cut off equal portions of that circle in
equal times; another most fantastical equalizing circle, supported by no other
foundation besides the frivolous connection betwixt a cone and an ellipse, and
recommended by nothing but the natural passion for circular orbits and equable
86
serve to show
motions. It may be regarded as the last effort of this passion, and may
the force of that principle which could thus oblige this accurate observer, and great
improver of the Theory of the Heavens, to adopt so strange an hypothesis. Such was
the difficulty and hesitation with which the followers of Copernicus adopted the
corrections of Kepler.

Kepler's rule for the planetary movement was intricate and difficult to comprehend. 

He said that if a straight line were drawn from the center of each Planet to the Sun, and carried along by the periodical motion of the Planet, it would describe equal areas in equal times, even if the Planet did not pass over equal spaces. 

The same rule took place nearly with regard to the Moon. 

The imagination, when acquainted with this law of motion, can follow it more easily. 

When not acquainted with this law, the mind would wander in uncertainty with regard to the proportion which regulates its varieties. 

The discovery of this analogy therefore made Kepler's system more agreeable to the natural taste of mankind. But it was still too difficult to be comprehended. 

Besides this, he introduced another new analogy into the system. It first discovered that there was one uniform relation observed between= 
- the distances of the Planets from the Sun, and
- the times employed in their periodical motions. 

He found that their periodical times were greater than in proportion to their distances, and less than in proportion to the squares of those distances. 

but, that they were nearly as the mean proportionals between their distances and the squares of their distances. 

In other words, that the squares of their periodical times were nearly as the cubes of their an analogy, which, though, like all others, it no doubt rendered the system distances; 

somewhat more distinct and comprehensible, was, however, as well as the former, of too intricate a nature to facilitate very much the effort of the imagination in conceiving it.
