## Section 1. General Provisions


Article 136

Public Power is distributed among Municipal Power, that of the States Power and National Power.

exercising the same shall cooperate with one another in attaining the ends of the State.

Article 137

The Constitution and the law shall define the authorities of the organs, which exercise
Public Power, and the activities carried on by such organs shall be subject to the same.

Article 138

An usurped authority is of no effect, and its acts are null and void.

Article 139

The exercise of Public Power gives rise to individual liability for abuse or misapplication
of power, or for violation of this Constitution or the law.

Article 140

The State shall be financially liable for any damages suffered by private individuals to
any of their property or rights, provided the harm is imputable to the functioning of
Public Administration.


## Section 2. Public Administration

Article 141

Public Administration is at the service of the citizen and is based on the principles of honesty, participation, expeditiousness, efficacy, efficiency, transparency, accountability and responsibility in the performance of public functions, being fully subject to the law and to the right.

Article 142

Autonomous institutions can be created only by law. Such institutions, as well as public interests in foundations or organs of any nature, shall be subject to State Control in such form as may be established by law.

Article 143

Citizens have the right to be informed by Public Administration, in a timely and truthful manner, of the status of proceedings in which they have a direct interest, and to be apprised of any final decisions adopted in the matter. 

Likewise, they have access to administrative files and records, without prejudice to the limits acceptable in a democratic society in matters relating to internal and external security, criminal,
investigation and the intimacy of private life, in accordance with law regulating the
matter of classification of documents with contents which are confidential or secret. No
censorship of public officials reporting on matters for which they are responsible shall be
permitted.

Positions in the organs of Public Administration are to be filled by career personnel.
Exceptions are those elected by popular vote, those whose holders may be appointed
and removed freely, those contracted for, laborers in the service of Public Administration
and any others determined by law.

Engagement of public officials to fill career positions shall be by public competition, based on principles of honesty, capability and efficiency. Promotion shall be governed by scientific methods based on the merit system, and transfer, suspension and removal shall depend on performance.

except in the cases expressly determined by law.
