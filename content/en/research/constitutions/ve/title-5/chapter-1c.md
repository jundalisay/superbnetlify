Article 202

The law is an act enacted by the National Assembly in legislative session. 

Laws that contain a systematic set of norms regulating a particular field may also be referred to as codes.

Article 203 

Organic Laws are those designated as such by this Constitution, those enacted to organize public powers or developing constitutional rights, and those which serve as a normative framework for other laws.

Any bill for the enactment of an organic law, except in the case of those defined as such in the Constitution itself, must first be accepted by the National Assembly, by a 2/3 vote of the members present, before the beginning of debate on the bill. This qualifying vote shall also apply to the process of amending organic acts.

Laws defined by the National Assembly as organic acts shall be sent, prior to promulgation, to the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice for a ruling on the constitutionality of their organic status. 

The Constitutional Division shall reach a decision within ten days of receipt of the communication. If the Constitutional
Division rules that the law is not organic, such the law shall lose the organic status.

Enabling laws are those enacted by a 3/5 vote of the members of the National Assembly to establish the guidelines, purposes and framework for matters that are being delegated to the President of the Republic, with the rank and force of a law.

Enabling law is to set the period for the exercising thereof.

Once the bill has been reported out of committee, the second debate on the bill shall begin, being conducted article by article. If the bill is approved without amendment, it shall be enacted into law. 

However, if amended it shall be returned to the Committee concerned for inclusion of the amendments by such Committee within no more than 15
consecutive days; once read the new version of the bill at a plenary session of the National Assembly, it shall decide as appropriate by majority vote on any articles as to which a discrepancy exists, and on any other articles relating thereto.
