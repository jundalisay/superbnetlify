53. Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation
Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a
proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its
containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand
or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.
The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or
moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may
not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the
House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without
modifications.
Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in
respect of all proposed laws.

54. Appropriation Bills
The proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government
shall deal only with such appropriation.

Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with one subject of
taxation only; but laws imposing duties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only, and laws imposing
duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only.
56. Recommendation of money votes
A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the
purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General
to the House in which the proposal originated.
57. Disagreement between the Houses
If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it
with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months
the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law with or without
any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails
to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor-
General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such dissolution shall
not take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of
time.
If after such dissolution the House of Representatives again passes the proposed law, with or without any
amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails
to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor-
General may convene a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.
The members present at the joint sitting may deliberate and shall vote together upon the proposed law as last
proposed by the House of Representatives, and upon amendments, if any, which have been made therein
by one House and not agreed to by the other, and any such amendments which are affirmed by an absolute
majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives shall be taken to
have been carried, and if the proposed law, with the amendments, if any, so carried is affirmed by an absolute majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, it shall be taken to have been duly passed by both Houses of the Parliament, and shall be presented to the Governor-General for the Queen’s assent.

58. Royal assent to Bills
When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the
Queen’s assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen’s name, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen’s pleasure.

Recommendations by Governor-General

The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him,
and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the
recommendation.

59. Disallowance by the Queen

The Queen may disallow any law within one year from the Governor-General’s assent, and such disallowance on being made known by the Governor-General by speech or message to each of the Houses of the Parliament, or by Proclamation, shall annul the law from the day when the disallowance is so made known.

60. Signification of Queen’s pleasure on Bills reserved

A proposed law reserved for the Queen’s pleasure shall not have any force unless and until within two years from the day on which it was presented to the Governor-General for the Queen’s assent the Governor-General makes known, by speech or message to each of the Houses of the Parliament, or by Proclamation, that it has received the Queen’s assent.
