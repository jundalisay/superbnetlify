It shall then be submitted to the people for ratification. This requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast at a special referendum or at such election as the Diet shall specify. 

Amendments when so ratified shall immediately be promulgated by the Emperor in the name of the people, as an integral part of this Constitution. 


## CHAPTER 10: SUPREME LAW

Article 98. This Constitution shall be the supreme law of the nation and no law, ordinance, imperial rescript or other act of government, or part thereof, contrary to the provisions hereof, shall have legal force or validity. The treaties concluded by Japan and established laws of nations shall be faithfully observed. 

Article 99. The Emperor or the Regent as well as Ministers of State, members of the Diet, judges, and all other public officials have the obligation to respect and uphold this Constitution.
