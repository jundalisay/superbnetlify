## CHAPTER 1: COMMON PROVISIONS

Article I-33

The legal acts of the Union
1. To exercise the Union's competences the institutions shall use as legal instruments, in accordance with Part 3, European laws, European framework laws, European regulations, European decisions, recommendations and opinions.

A European law shall be a legislative act of general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

A European framework law shall be a legislative act binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.

A European regulation shall be a non-legislative act of general application for the implementation of legislative acts and of certain provisions of the Constitution. It may either be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States, or be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form
and methods.

A European decision shall be a non-legislative act, binding in its entirety. A decision which specifies
those to whom it is addressed shall be binding only on them.
Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force.

2. When considering draft legislative acts, the European Parliament and the Council shall refrain
from adopting acts not provided for by the relevant legislative procedure in the area in question.

Article I-34
Legislative acts

1. European laws and framework laws shall be adopted, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, jointly by the European Parliament and the Council under the ordinary legislative procedure as set out in Article 3-396. If the two institutions cannot reach agreement on an act, it shall not be adopted.

2. In the specific cases provided for in the Constitution, European laws and framework laws shall be adopted by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament, in accordance with special legislative procedures.

Non-legislative acts
1. The European Council shall adopt European decisions in the cases provided for in the
Constitution.

The Commission, and the European Central Bank in the specific cases provided for in the
Constitution, shall adopt recommendations.

Article I-36

Delegated European regulations
1. European laws and framework laws may delegate to the Commission the power to adopt
delegated European regulations to supplement or amend certain non‑essential elements of the law or
framework law.
The objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power shall be explicitly defined in
the European laws and framework laws. The essential elements of an area shall be reserved for the
European law or framework law and accordingly shall not be the subject of a delegation of power.
2. European laws and framework laws shall explicitly lay down the conditions to which the
delegation is subject; these conditions may be as follows:
(a) the European Parliament or the Council may decide to revoke the delegation;
(b) the delegated European regulation may enter into force only if no objection has been expressed
by the European Parliament or the Council within a period set by the European law or framework
law.
For the purposes of (a) and (b), the European Parliament shall act by a majority of its component
members, and the Council by a qualified majority.

Article I-37
Implementing acts

1. Member States shall adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding
Union acts.
2. Where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, those acts
shall confer implementing powers on the Commission, or, in duly justified specific cases and in the
cases provided for in Article I-40, on the Council.
3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, European laws shall lay down in advance the rules and general
principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of
implementing powers.
4. Union implementing acts shall take the form of European implementing regulations or European
implementing decisions.

Article I-38

Principles common to the Union's legal acts
1. Where the Constitution does not specify the type of act to be adopted, the institutions shall select
it on a case-by-case basis, in compliance with the applicable procedures and with the principle of
proportionality referred to in Article I‑11.
2. Legal acts shall state the reasons on which they are based and shall refer to any proposals,
initiatives, recommendations, requests or opinions required by the Constitution.

Article I-40
Specific provisions relating to the common foreign and security policy

Article I-41

Specific provisions relating to the common security and defence policy

prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United
Nations Charter. The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using capabilities provided by
the Member States.

2. The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common
Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting
unanimously, so decides. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a
decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.

The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of
the security and defence policy of certain Member States, it shall respect the obligations of certain
Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,
under the North Atlantic Treaty, and be compatible with the common security and defence policy
established within that framework.
3. Member States shall make civilian and military capabilities available to the Union for the
implementation of the common security and defence policy, to contribute to the objectives defined
by the Council. Those Member States which together establish multinational forces may also make
them available to the common security and defence policy.
Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities. An Agency in the
field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments (European Defence
Agency) shall be established to identify operational requirements, to promote measures to satisfy
those requirements, to contribute to identifying and, where appropriate, implementing any measure
needed to strengthen the industrial and technological base of the defence sector, to participate in
defining a European capabilities and armaments policy, and to assist the Council in evaluating the
improvement of military capabilities.
4. European decisions relating to the common security and defence policy, including those
initiating a mission as referred to in this Article, shall be adopted by the Council acting unanimously

instruments, together with the Commission where appropriate.

binding commitments to one another in this area with a view to the most demanding missions shall
establish permanent structured cooperation within the Union framework. Such cooperation shall be
governed by Article 3-312. It shall not affect the provisions of Article 3-309.
7. If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall
have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security
and defence policy of certain Member States.
Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the
foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.

the common security and defence policy. It shall be kept informed of how it evolves.
