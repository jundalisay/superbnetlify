TITLE 3: UNION COMPETENCES

Article I-11
Fundamental principles
1. The limits of Union competences are governed by the principle of conferral. The use of Union
competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
2. Under the principle of conferral, the Union shall act within the limits of the competences
conferred upon it by the Member States in the Constitution to attain the objectives set out in the
Constitution. Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Constitution remain with the
Member States.
3. Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence,
the Union shall act only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by
reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.
The institutions of the Union shall apply the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in the Protocol on
the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. National Parliaments shall ensure
compliance with that principle in accordance with the procedure set out in that Protocol.
4. Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed
what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Constitution.

The institutions of the Union shall apply the principle of proportionality as laid down in the Protocol
on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.

Article I-12

Categories of competence
1. When the Constitution confers on the Union exclusive competence in a specific area, only the
Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves
only if so empowered by the Union or for the implementation of Union acts.
2. When the Constitution confers on the Union a competence shared with the Member States in a
specific area, the Union and the Member States may legislate and adopt legally binding acts in that
area. The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not
exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence.
3. The Member States shall coordinate their economic and employment policies within
arrangements as determined by Part III, which the Union shall have competence to provide.
4. The Union shall have competence to define and implement a common foreign and security
policy, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy.
5. In certain areas and under the conditions laid down in the Constitution, the Union shall have
competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the
Member States, without thereby superseding their competence in these areas.
Legally binding acts of the Union adopted on the basis of the provisions in Part III relating to these
areas shall not entail harmonisation of Member States' laws or regulations.
6. The scope of and arrangements for exercising the Union's competences shall be determined by
the provisions relating to each area in Part III.
