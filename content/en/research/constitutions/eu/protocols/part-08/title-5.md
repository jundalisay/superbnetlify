SECTION 2
Provisions on agriculture
Article 47
Where there are serious difficulties resulting from accession which remain after full utilisation of
Article 48 and of the other measures resulting from the rules existing in the Union, the Commission
may adopt a European decision authorising Finland to grant national aids to producers so as to
facilitate their full integration into the common agricultural policy.
Article 48
1. The Commission shall adopt European decisions authorising Finland and Sweden to grant
long‑term national aids with a view to ensuring that agricultural activity is maintained in specific
regions. These regions should cover the agricultural areas situated to the north of the 62nd Parallel
and some adjacent areas south of that parallel affected by comparable climatic conditions rendering
agricultural activity particularly difficult.
2. The regions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by the Commission, taking into
consideration in particular:
(a) the low population density;
(b) the portion of agricultural land in the overall surface area;
(c) the portion of agricultural land devoted to arable crops intended for human consumption, in the
agricultural surface area used.
3. The national aids provided for in paragraph 1 may be related to physical factors of production,
such as hectares of agricultural land or heads of animal taking account of the relevant limits laid
down in the common organisations of the market, as well as the historical production patterns of
each farm, but must not:
(a) be linked to future production;
(b) or lead to an increase in production or in the level of overall support recorded during a reference
period preceding 1 January 1995, to be determined by the Commission.
These aids may be differentiated by region.
These aids must be granted in particular in order to:
(a) maintain traditional primary production and processing naturally suited to the climatic
conditions of the regions concerned;
(b) improve the structures for the production, marketing and processing of agricultural products;954393_TRAITE_EN_251_300

(c) facilitate the disposal of the said products;
(d) ensure that the environment is protected and the countryside preserved.
Article 49
1. The aids provided for in Articles 47 and 48 and any other national aid subject to Commission
authorisation under this Title shall be notified to the Commission. They may not be applied until
such authorisation has been given.
2. As regards the aids provided for in Article 48, the Commission shall submit to the Council every
five years as from 1 January 1996 a report on:
(a) the authorisations granted;
(b) the results of the aid granted under such authorisations.
In preparation for drawing up such reports, Member States in receipt of such authorisations shall
supply the Commission in good time with information on the effects of the aids granted, illustrating
the development noted in the agricultural economy of the regions in question.
Article 50
In the field of the aids provided for in Articles III‑167 and III‑168 of the Constitution:
(a) among the aids applied in Austria, Finland and Sweden prior to 1 January 1995, only those
notified to the Commission by 30 April 1995 will be deemed to be existing aids within the
meaning of Article 3‑168(1) of the Constitution;
(b) existing aids and plans intended to grant or alter aids which were notified to the Commission
prior to 1 January 1995 shall be deemed to have been notified on that date.
Article 51
1. Unless otherwise stipulated in specific cases, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission,
shall adopt the necessary European regulations or decisions to implement this Section.
2. A European law of the Council may make the adaptations to the provisions appearing in this
Section which may prove necessary as a result of a modification in Union law. The Council shall act
unanimously after consulting the European Parliament.
Article 52
1. If transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the existing regime in
Austria, Finland and Sweden to that resulting from application of the common organisation of the
markets under the conditions set out in the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the
Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, such measures shall be
adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC or,
as appropriate, in the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation954393_TRAITE_EN_251_300

operation of this Section.
Article 72
1. This Article shall apply to the carriage of goods by road on journeys carried out within the
territory of the Community.
2. For journeys which involve transit of goods by road through Austria, the regime established for

Article.

(b) The reductions in total NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles shall be administered

5. Before 1 January 2001, the Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment
Agency, shall make a scientific study of the degree to which the objective concerning reduction of
pollution set out in paragraph 3(a) has been achieved. If the Commission concludes that this objective
has been achieved on a sustainable basis, the provisions of paragraph 3 shall cease to apply on
