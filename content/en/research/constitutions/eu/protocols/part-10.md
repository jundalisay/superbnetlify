## 11. PROTOCOL ON THE CONVERGENCE CRITERIA

<!-- THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
DESIRING to lay down the details of the convergence criteria which shall guide the Union in taking decisions referred to
in Article 3-198 of the Constitution to end the derogations of those Member States with a derogation,
HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe: -->

Article 1

The criterion on price stability referred to in Article 3-198(1)(a) of the Constitution shall mean that
the Member State concerned has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of
inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more
than 1,5 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of
price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the consumer price index on a comparable
basis, taking into account differences in national definitions.
Article 2
The criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in Article 3-198(1)(b) of the
Constitution shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State concerned is not the
subject of a European decision of the Council under Article 3-184(6) of the Constitution that an
excessive deficit exists.
Article 3
The criterion on participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
referred to in Article 3-198(1)(c) of the Constitution shall mean that the Member State concerned
has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the
examination. In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency's bilateral central
rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period.
Article 4
The criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in Article 3-198(1)(d) of the
Constitution shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, the Member
State concerned has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more
than 2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price
stability. Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable
securities, taking into account differences in national definitions.

Article 5
The statistical data to be used for the application of this Protocol shall be provided by the
Commission.

Article 6

The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, the European Central Bank, and the Economic and Financial Committee referred to in Article 3-192 of the Constitution, adopt appropriate provisions to lay down the details
of the convergence criteria referred to in Article 3-198 of the Constitution, which shall then replace
this Protocol.

DESIRING to promote conditions for stronger economic growth in the European Union and, to that end, to develop

HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which are annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: -->

The Ministers of the Member States whose currency is the euro shall meet informally. Such meetings
shall take place, when necessary, to discuss questions related to the specific responsibilities they share

European Central Bank shall be invited to take part in such meetings, which shall be prepared by the
representatives of the Ministers with responsibility for finance of the Member States whose currency
is the euro and of the Commission.
