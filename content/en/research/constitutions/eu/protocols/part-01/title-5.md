Article 57

The Union rules and arrangements on transit of persons by land between the region of Kaliningrad
and other parts of the Russian Federation, and in particular the Council Regulation (EC) No 693/
2003 of 14 April 2003 establishing a specific Facilitated Transit Document (FTD), a Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) and amending the Common Consular Instructions and the Common
Manual ( 1 ), shall not in themselves delay or prevent the full participation of Lithuania in the
Schengen acquis, including the removal of internal border controls.

Article 58

The Union shall assist Lithuania in implementing the rules and arrangements for the transit of
persons between the region of Kaliningrad and the other parts of the Russian Federation with a view
to Lithuania's full participation in the Schengen area as soon as possible.
The Union shall assist Lithuania in managing the transit of persons between the region of Kaliningrad
and the other parts of the Russian Federation and shall, notably, bear any additional costs incurred by
implementing the specific provisions of the acquis provided for such transit.
Article 59
Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of Lithuania, any further act concerning the transit of
persons between the region of Kaliningrad and other parts of the Russian Federation shall be adopted
by the Council on a proposal from the Commission. The Council shall act unanimously.
Article 60
This Title shall apply in the light of the Declaration on the transit of persons by land between the
region of Kaliningrad and other parts of the Russian Federation, which incorporates, without altering
its legal affect, the wording of the preamble to Protocol 5 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003.

TITLE 6

PROVISIONS ON THE ACQUISITION OF SECONDARY RESIDENCES IN MALTA

Article 61
Bearing in mind the very limited number of residences in Malta and the very limited land available for
construction purposes, which can only cover the basic needs created by the demographic
development of the present residents, Malta may on a non‑discriminatory basis maintain in force the
rules on the acquisition and holding of immovable property for secondary residence purposes by
nationals of the Member States who have not legally resided in Malta for at least five years laid down
in the Immovable Property (Acquisition by Non‑Residents) Act (Chapter 246).
( 1 )

Malta shall apply authorisation procedures for the acquisition of immovable property for secondary
residence purposes in Malta, which shall be based on published, objective, stable and transparent
criteria. These criteria shall be applied in a non‑discriminatory manner and shall not differentiate
between nationals of Malta and of other Member States. Malta shall ensure that in no instance shall a
national of a Member State be treated in a more restrictive way than a national of a third country.
In the event that the value of one such property bought by a national of a Member State exceeds the
thresholds provided for in Malta's legislation, namely 30 000 Maltese lira for apartments and 50 000
Maltese lira for any type of property other than apartments and property of historical importance,
authorisation shall be granted. Malta may revise the thresholds established by such legislation to
reflect changes in prices in the property market in Malta.

TITLE VII

PROVISIONS ON ABORTION IN MALTA

Article 62
Nothing in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe or in the Treaties and Acts modifying or
supplementing it shall affect the application in the territory of Malta of national legislation relating to
abortion.
