Transitional provisions for the capital of the European Central Bank
In accordance with Article 29, each national central bank shall be assigned a weighting in the key for
subscription of the European Central Bank's capital. By way of derogation from Article 28(3), central
banks of Member States with a derogation shall not pay up their subscribed capital unless the General
Council, acting by a majority representing at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the
European Central Bank and at least half of the shareholders, decides that a minimal percentage has to
be paid up as a contribution to the operational costs of the European Central Bank.
Article 48
Deferred payment of capital, reserves and provisions of the European Central Bank
1. The central bank of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated shall pay up its
subscribed share of the capital of the European Central Bank to the same extent as the central banks
of other Member States whose currency is the euro, and shall transfer to the European Central Bank
foreign reserve assets in accordance with Article 30(1). The sum to be transferred shall be determined
by multiplying the euro value at current exchange rates of the foreign reserve assets which have
already been transferred to the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 30(1), by the ratio
between the number of shares subscribed by the national central bank concerned and the number of
shares already paid up by the other national central banks.
2. In addition to the payment to be made in accordance with paragraph 1, the national central bank
concerned shall contribute to the reserves of the European Central Bank, to those provisions
equivalent to reserves, and to the amount still to be appropriated to the reserves and provisions
corresponding to the balance of the profit and loss account as at 31 December of the year prior to
the abrogation of the derogation. The sum to be contributed shall be determined by multiplying the
amount of the reserves, as defined above and as stated in the approved balance sheet of the European
Central Bank, by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the central bank concerned
and the number of shares already paid up by the other central banks.
3. Upon one or more countries becoming Member States and their respective national central
banks becoming part of the European System of Central Banks, the subscribed capital of the
European Central Bank and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred
to the European Central Bank shall be automatically increased. The increase shall be determined by
multiplying the respective amounts then prevailing by the ratio, within the expanded capital key between the weighting of the entering national central banks concerned and the weighting of the national central banks already members of the European System of Central Banks. Each national
central bank's weighting in the capital key shall be calculated by analogy with Article 29(1) and in
compliance with Article 29(2). The reference periods to be used for the statistical data shall be
identical to those applied for the latest quinquennial adjustment of the weightings under Article 29
(3).
Article 49
Derogation from Article 32
1. If, after the start of the third stage, the Governing Council decides that the application of
Article 32 results in significant changes in national central banks' relative income positions, the

which shall not exceed 60 % in the first financial year after the start of the third stage and which shall
decrease by at least 12 percentage points in each subsequent financial year.
2. Paragraph 1 shall be applicable for not more than five financial years after the start of the third
