diplomatic missions.
Official correspondence and other official communications of the institutions of the Union shall not
be subject to censorship.
Article 6
Laissez-passer in a form to be prescribed by a European regulation of the Council acting by a simple
majority, which shall be recognised as valid travel documents by the authorities of the Member States,

institutions. These laissez-passer shall be issued to officials and other servants under conditions laid

legal proceedings.
Immunity shall likewise apply to members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting

not prevent the European Parliament from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its
members.
