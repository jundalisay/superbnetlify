TITLE 3: PROCEDURE BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE
Article 19
The Member States and the institutions of the Union shall be represented before the Court of Justice
by an agent appointed for each case. The agent may be assisted by an adviser or by a lawyer.
The States, other than the Member States, which are parties to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area and also the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority referred
to in that Agreement shall be represented in same manner.
Other parties must be represented by a lawyer.
Only a lawyer authorised to practise before a court of a Member State or of another State which is a
party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area may represent or assist a party before the
Court of Justice.
Such agents, advisers and lawyers shall, when they appear before the Court of Justice, enjoy the rights
and immunities necessary to the independent exercise of their duties, under conditions laid down in
the Rules of Procedure.
As regards such advisers and lawyers who appear before it, the Court of Justice shall have the powers
normally accorded to courts of law, under conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure.
University teachers being nationals of a Member State whose law accords them a right of audience
shall have the same rights before the Court of Justice as are accorded by this Article to lawyers.
Article 20
The procedure before the Court of Justice shall consist of two parts: written and oral.
The written procedure shall consist of the communication to the parties and to the institutions,
bodies, offices or agencies of the Union whose acts are in dispute, of applications, statements of case,
defences and observations, and of replies, if any, as well as of all papers and documents in support or
of certified copies of them.
Communications shall be made by the Registrar in the order and within the time laid down in the
Rules of Procedure.
The oral procedure shall consist of the reading of the report presented by a Judge acting as
Rapporteur, the hearing by the Court of Justice of agents, advisers and lawyers and of the submissions
of the Advocate General, as well as the hearing, if any, of witnesses and experts.954393_TRAITE_EN_201_250

Part IV
Where it considers that the case raises no new point of law, the Court of Justice may decide, after
hearing the Advocate-General, that the case shall be determined without a submission from the
Advocate General.
Article 21
A case shall be brought before the Court of Justice by a written application addressed to the Registrar.
The application shall contain the applicant's name and permanent address and the description of the
signatory, the name of the party or names of the parties against whom the application is made, the
subject matter of the dispute, the form of order sought and a brief statement of the pleas in law on
which the application is based.
The application shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by the measure the annulment of which is
sought or, in the circumstances referred to in Article 3-367 of the Constitution, by documentary
evidence of the date on which an institution was, in accordance with that Article, requested to act. If
the documents are not submitted with the application, the Registrar shall ask the party concerned to
produce them within a reasonable period, but in that event the rights of the party shall not lapse even
if such documents are produced after the time limit for bringing proceedings.
Article 22
A case governed by Article 18 of the EAEC Treaty shall be brought before the Court of Justice by an
appeal addressed to the Registrar. The appeal shall contain the name and permanent address of the
applicant and the description of the signatory, a reference to the decision against which the appeal is
brought, the names of the respondents, the subject matter of the dispute, the submissions and a brief
statement of the grounds on which the appeal is based.
The appeal shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the decision of the Arbitration Committee
which is contested.
If the Court rejects the appeal, the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall become final.
If the Court annuls the decision of the Arbitration Committee, the matter may be reopened, where
appropriate, on the initiative of one of the parties in the case, before the Arbitration Committee. The
latter shall conform to any decisions on points of law given by the Court.
Article 23
In the cases governed by Article 3-369 of the Constitution, the decision of the court or tribunal of a
Member State which suspends its proceedings and refers a case to the Court of Justice shall be
notified to the Court of Justice by the court or tribunal concerned. The decision shall then be notified
by the Registrar of the Court of Justice to the parties, to the Member States and to the Commission,
and to the institution, body, office or agency which adopted the act the validity or interpretation of
which is in dispute.
Within two months of this notification, the parties, the Member States, the Commission and, where
appropriate, the institution, body, office or agency which adopted the act the validity or
interpretation of which is in dispute, shall be entitled to submit statements of case or written
observations to the Court of Justice.954393_TRAITE_EN_201_250

Court of Justice to the States, other than the Member States, which are parties to the Agreement on

a preliminary ruling on a question falling within the scope of the agreement, the decision of the

countries concerned. Within two months from such notification, those countries may lodge at the
Court of Justice statements of case or written observations.

The President of the Court of Justice may, by way of summary procedure, which may, insofar as

379(1) of the Constitution and Article 157 of the EAEC Treaty, or to prescribe interim measures in
pursuance of Article 3-379(2) of the Constitution, or to suspend enforcement in accordance with

the EAEC Treaty.
Should the President be prevented from attending, his place shall be taken by another Judge under

prejudice the decision of the Court of Justice on the substance of the case.
