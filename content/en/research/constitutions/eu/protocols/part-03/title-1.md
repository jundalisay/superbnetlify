PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 

<!-- THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES
DESIRING to lay down the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union provided for in Article 3-381 of the
Constitution,
HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community: -->

Article 1
The Court of Justice of the European Union shall be constituted and shall function in accordance with
the Constitution, with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC Treaty) and with this Statute.

TITLE 1: JUDGES AND ADVOCATES-GENERAL

Article 2
Before taking up his duties each Judge shall, before the Court of Justice sitting in open court, take an
oath to perform his duties impartially and conscientiously and to preserve the secrecy of the
deliberations of the Court.

Article 3

The Judges shall be immune from legal proceedings. After they have ceased to hold office, they shall
continue to enjoy immunity in respect of acts performed by them in their official capacity, including
words spoken or written.
The Court of Justice, sitting as a full Court, may waive the immunity. If the decision concerns a
member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the
court concerned.
Where immunity has been waived and criminal proceedings are instituted against a Judge, he shall be
tried, in any of the Member States, only by the court competent to judge the members of the highest
national judiciary.
Articles 11 to 14 and Article 17 of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the Union shall
apply to the Judges, Advocates-General, Registrars and Assistant Rapporteurs of the Court of Justice
of the European Union, without prejudice to the provisions relating to immunity from legal
proceedings of Judges which are set out in the first, second and third paragraphs of this Article.

Article 4

The Judges may not hold any political or administrative office.
They may not engage in any occupation, whether gainful or not, unless exemption is exceptionally
granted by a European decision of the Council, acting by a simple majority.
When taking up their duties, they shall give a solemn undertaking that, both during and after their
term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom, in particular the duty to behave
with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of
certain appointments or benefits.
Any doubt on this point shall be settled by decision of the Court of Justice. If the decision concerns a
member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the
court concerned.

Article 5

Apart from normal replacement, or death, the duties of a Judge shall end when he resigns.
Where a Judge resigns, his letter of resignation shall be addressed to the President of the Court of
Justice for transmission to the President of the Council. Upon this notification a vacancy shall arise
on the bench.
Save where Article 6 applies, a Judge shall continue to hold office until his successor takes up his
duties.

Article 6

A Judge may be deprived of his office or of his right to a pension or other benefits in its stead only if,
in the unanimous opinion of the Judges and Advocates-General of the Court of Justice, he no longer
fulfils the requisite conditions or meets the obligations arising from his office. The Judge concerned
shall not take part in any such deliberations. If the person concerned is a member of the General
Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the court concerned.
The Registrar of the Court of Justice shall communicate the decision of the Court of Justice to the
President of the European Parliament and to the President of the Commission and shall notify it to
the President of the Council.
In the case of a decision depriving a Judge of his office, a vacancy shall arise on the bench upon this
latter notification.
Article 7
A Judge who is to replace a member of the Court of Justice whose term of office has not expired shall
be appointed for the remainder of his predecessor's term.
Article 8
The provisions of Articles 2 to 7 shall apply to the Advocates-General.
