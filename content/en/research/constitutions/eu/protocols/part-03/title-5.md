TITLE 5: FINAL PROVISIONS

Article 63

The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and of the General Court shall contain any provisions
necessary for applying and, where required, supplementing this Statute.

Article 64

The rules governing the language arrangements applicable at the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be laid down by a European regulation of the Council acting unanimously. This regulation shall be adopted either at the request of the Court of Justice and after consultation of the Commission and the European Parliament, or on a proposal from the Commission and after consultation of the Court of Justice and of the European Parliament.

Until those rules have been adopted, the provisions of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice
and of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court governing language arrangements shall apply. By
way of derogation from Articles III-355 and III-356 of the Constitution, those provisions may only
be amended or repealed with the unanimous consent of the Council.

Article 65
1. By way of derogation from Article IV-437 of the Constitution, any amendment to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty establishing the European Community and to the EAEC Treaty, which is adopted between the signing and the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, shall remain in force.
2. In order to incorporate them into the enacting terms of this Statute, the amendments referred to
in paragraph 1 shall be subject to official codification by a European law of the Council, adopted at
the request of the Court of Justice. When such codifying European law enters into force, this Article
shall be repealed.
