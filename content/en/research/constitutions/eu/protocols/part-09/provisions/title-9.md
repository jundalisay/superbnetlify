Article 64

Slovakia has undertaken to close Unit 1 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant by 31 December
2006 at the latest and Unit 2 of this plant by 31 December 2008 at the latest and subsequently
decommission these units.

Article 65

1. During the period 2004‑2006, the Union shall provide Slovakia with financial assistance in
support of its efforts to decommission, and to address the consequences of the closure and
decommissioning of, Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant (hereinafter referred
to as ‘the Assistance’).
2. The Assistance shall be decided and implemented in accordance with the provisions laid down in
Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of
Central and Eastern Europe ( 1 ).
3. For the period 2004‑2006 the Assistance shall amount to 90 million euro in commitment
appropriations, to be committed in equal annual tranches.

Article 66

The Union acknowledges that the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 Nuclear Power plant must
continue beyond the Financial Perspective as defined in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May
1999, and that this effort represents for Slovakia a significant financial burden. Decisions on the
continuation of Union assistance in this field after 2006 will take the situation into account.

Article 67

The provisions of this Title shall apply in the light of the Declaration on Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the
Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant in Slovakia which incorporates, without altering its legal effect, the
wording of the preamble to Protocol 9 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003.
