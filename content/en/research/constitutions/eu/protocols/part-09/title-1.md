Act of Accession of 16 April 2003, as well as any further such acts adopted before 1 May 2004, shall
be binding on and applicable in the new Member States from 1 May 2004.
2. Those provisions of the Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the Union and the
acts building upon it or otherwise related to it not referred to in paragraph 1, while binding on the
new Member States from 1 May 2004, shall apply in a new Member State only pursuant to a
European decision of the Council to that effect after verification in accordance with the applicable
Schengen evaluation procedures that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the
acquis concerned have been met in that new Member State.
The Council shall take its decision, after consulting the European Parliament, acting with the
unanimity of its members representing the Governments of the Member States in respect of which
the provisions referred to in the present paragraph have already been put into effect and of the
representative of the Government of the Member State in respect of which those provisions are to be put into effect. The members of the Council representing the Governments of Ireland and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall take part in such a decision insofar as it
relates to the provisions of the Schengen acquis and the acts building upon it or otherwise related to it
in which these Member States participate.

Treaty:
(a) to accede to those which, by 1 May 2004, have been opened for signature by the present Member
States, and to those which have been drawn up by the Council in accordance with Title VI of the
EU Treaty and recommended to the Member States for adoption;
(b) to introduce administrative and other arrangements, such as those adopted by 1 May 2004 by the

decisions and agreements adopted by the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States,
meeting within the Council, shall be required to accede to all other agreements concluded by the
present Member States relating to the functioning of the Union or connected with the activities
thereof.

Treaty, insofar as they are still in force, and also to the protocols on the interpretation of those
conventions by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, signed by the present Member
States, and to this end they shall be required to enter into negotiations with the present Member
States in order to make the necessary adjustments thereto.

Article 6

1. The new Member States shall be required to accede, under the conditions laid down in this
Protocol, to the agreements or conventions concluded or provisionally applied by the present
Member States and the Union or the European Atomic Energy Community, acting jointly, and to the
agreements concluded by those States which are related to those agreements or conventions. The accession of the new Member States to the agreements or conventions mentioned in paragraph 4, as well as the agreements with Belarus, China, Chile, Mercosur and Switzerland which have been 
concluded or signed by the Community and its present Member States jointly shall be agreed by the
conclusion of a protocol to such agreements or conventions between the Council, acting
unanimously on behalf of the Member States, and the third country or countries or international
organisation concerned. This procedure is without prejudice to the Union's and the European Atomic
Energy Community's own competences and does not affect the allocation of powers between the
Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and the Member States as regards the
conclusion of such agreements in the future or any other amendments not related to accession. The
Commission shall negotiate these protocols on behalf of the Member States on the basis of
negotiating directives approved by the Council, acting by unanimity, and in consultation with a
committee comprised of the representatives of the Member States. It shall submit a draft of the
protocols for conclusion to the Council.
2. Upon acceding to the agreements and conventions referred to in paragraph 1 the new Member
States shall acquire the same rights and obligations under those agreements and conventions as the
present Member States.
3. The new Member States shall be required to accede, under the conditions laid down in this
Protocol, to the Agreement on the European Economic Area ( 1 ), in accordance with Article 128 of
that Agreement.
4. As from 1 May 2004, and, where appropriate, pending the conclusion of the necessary protocols
referred to in paragraph 1, the new Member States shall apply the provisions of the Agreements
concluded by the present Member States and, jointly, the Community, with Algeria, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Egypt, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Israel,
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, Romania, the Russian
Federation, San Marino, South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and
Uzbekistan as well as the provisions of other agreements concluded jointly by the present Member
States and the Community before 1 May 2004.
Any adjustments to these Agreements shall be the subject of protocols concluded with the
co‑contracting countries in conformity with the provisions of the second subparagraph of paragraph
1. Should the protocols not have been concluded by 1 May 2004, the Union, the European Atomic
Energy Community and the Member States shall take, in the framework of their respective
competences, the necessary measures to deal with that situation.
5. As from 1 May 2004, the new Member States shall apply the bilateral textile agreements and
arrangements concluded by the Community with third countries.
The quantitative restrictions applied by the Union on imports of textile and clothing products shall
be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States.
Should the amendments to the bilateral textile agreements and arrangements not have entered into
force by 1 May 2004, the Union shall make the necessary adjustments to its rules for the import of
textile and clothing products from third countries to take into account the accession of the new
Member States.
6. The quantitative restrictions applied by the Union on imports of steel and steel products shall be
adjusted on the basis of imports by new Member States during the years immediately preceding the
signing of the Accession Treaty of steel products originating in the supplier countries concerned.
7. Fisheries agreements concluded before 1 May 2004 by the new Member States with third
countries shall be managed by the Union.
The rights and obligations resulting for the new Member States from those agreements shall not be
affected during the period in which the provisions of those agreements are provisionally maintained.
As soon as possible, and in any event before the expiry of the agreements referred to in the first
subparagraph, appropriate European decisions for the continuation of fishing activities resulting from
those agreements shall be adopted in each case by the Council on a proposal from the Commission,
including the possibility of extending certain agreements for periods not exceeding one year.
8. With effect from 1 May 2004, the new Member States shall withdraw from any free trade
agreements with third countries, including the Central European Free Trade Agreement.
To the extent that agreements between one or more of the new Member States on the one hand, and
one or more third countries on the other, are not compatible with the obligations arising from the
Constitution and in particular from this Protocol, the new Member States shall take all appropriate
steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. If a new Member State encounters difficulties in
adjusting an agreement concluded with one or more third countries before accession, it shall,
according to the terms of the agreement, withdraw from that agreement.
9. The new Member States shall take appropriate measures, where necessary, to adjust their
position in relation to international organisations, and in relation to those international agreements
to which the Union or the European Atomic Energy Community or other Member States are also
parties, to the rights and obligations arising from their accession to the Union.
They shall in particular withdraw at 1 May 2004 or the earliest possible date thereafter from
international fisheries agreements and organisations to which the Union is also a party, unless their
membership relates to matters other than fisheries.

agencies of the Community or of the European Union established by the Treaty on European Union
shall remain in force subject to the application of the second paragraph.

These provisions shall have the same status in law as the acts which they repeal or amend and shall be
subject to the same rules as those acts.

Article 9

The texts of the acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Community or of the
European Union established by the Treaty on European Union and the texts of acts of the European
Central Bank which were adopted before 1 May 2004 and which were drawn up in the Czech,
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Maltese, Polish, Slovenian and Slovak languages shall be
authentic from that date, under the same conditions as the texts drawn up and authentic in the other
languages.
