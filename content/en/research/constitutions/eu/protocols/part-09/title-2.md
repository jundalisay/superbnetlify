Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the
framework of the pre‑accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 ( 1 ).
If these decisions to waive ex ante control have not been adopted before 1 May 2004, any contracts
signed between 1 May 2004 and the date on which the Commission decisions are taken shall not be
eligible for pre‑accession assistance.
However, exceptionally, if the Commission decisions to waive ex‑ante control are delayed beyond
1 May 2004 for reasons not attributable to the authorities of a new Member State, the Commission
may accept, in duly justified cases, eligibility for pre‑accession assistance of contracts signed between
1 May 2004 and the date of these decisions, and the continued implementation of pre‑accession
assistance for a limited period, subject to ex ante control by the Commission over tendering and
contracting.
2. Global budget commitments made before 1 May 2004 under the pre‑accession financial
instruments referred to in paragraph 1, including the conclusion and registration of subsequent
individual legal commitments and payments made after 1 May 2004, shall continue to be governed
by the rules and regulations of the pre‑accession financing instruments and be charged to the
corresponding budget chapters until closure of the programmes and projects concerned.
Notwithstanding this, public procurement procedures initiated after 1 May 2004 shall be carried
out in accordance with the relevant Union acts.
3. The last programming exercise for the pre‑accession assistance referred to in paragraph 1 shall
take place in the last full calendar year preceding 1 May 2004. Actions under these programmes will
have to be contracted within the following two years and disbursements made as provided for in the
Financing Memorandum ( 2 ), usually by the end of the third year after the commitment. No
extensions shall be granted for the contracting period. Exceptionally and in duly justified cases,
limited extensions in terms of duration may be granted for disbursement.
4. In order to ensure the necessary phasing out of the pre‑accession financial instruments referred
to in paragraph 1 as well as the ISPA programme, and a smooth transition from the rules applicable
before and after 1 May 2004, the Commission may take all appropriate measures to ensure that the
necessary statutory staff is maintained in the new Member States for a maximum of fifteen months
following that date.
During this period, officials assigned to posts in the new Member States before accession and who are
required to remain in service in those States after 1 May 2004 shall benefit, as an exception, from the
same financial and material conditions as were applied by the Commission before 1 May 2004
in accordance with Annex X to the Staff Regulations of officials and the conditions of employment
of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC)

programme, of the relevant pre‑accession budgets.
5. Where projects approved under Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 can no longer be funded under
that instrument, they may be integrated into rural development programming and financed under the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Should specific transitional measures be
necessary in this regard, these shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedures
laid down in Article 50(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down
general provisions on the Structural Funds ( 2 ).
Article 23

assistance, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Transition Facility’, to the new Member States to develop and
strengthen their administrative capacity to implement and enforce Union and European Atomic
Energy Community law and to foster exchange of best practice among peers.

institution‑building, the procedure for call for proposals through the network of contact points in the
Member States shall continue to apply, as established in the Framework Agreements with the present
Member States for the purpose of pre‑accession assistance.

States shall submit, no later than six months after expiry of the three‑year deadline, a comprehensive
report on the financial execution of the lump‑sum grant payments with a statement justifying the

applicable to decentralised management in the said Financial Regulation or in the European law
replacing it.

Article 26
1. If, until the end of a period of up to three years after 1 May 2004, difficulties arise which are
serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious
deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, a new Member State may apply for
authorisation to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector
concerned to the economy of the internal market.
In the same circumstances, any present Member State may apply for authorisation to take protective
measures with regard to one or more of the new Member States.
2. Upon request by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, adopt the
European regulations or decisions establishing the protective measures which it considers necessary,
specifying the conditions and modalities under which they are to be put into effect.
In the event of serious economic difficulties and at the express request of the Member State
concerned, the Commission shall act within five working days of the receipt of the request
accompanied by the relevant background information. The measures thus decided on shall be
applicable forthwith, shall take account of the interests of all parties concerned and shall not entail
frontier controls.
3. The measures authorised under paragraph 2 may involve derogations from the rules of the
Constitution, and in particular from this Protocol, to such an extent and for such periods as are
strictly necessary in order to attain the objectives referred to in paragraph 1. Priority shall be given to
such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the internal market.
Article 27
If a new Member State has failed to implement commitments undertaken in the context of the
accession negotiations, causing a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market, including
any commitments in all sectoral policies which concern economic activities with cross‑border effect,
or an imminent risk of such breach, the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three
years after 1 May 2004, upon the motivated request of a Member State or on its own initiative, adopt
European regulations or decisions establishing appropriate measures.
Measures shall be proportional and priority shall be given to measures which least disturb the
functioning of the internal market and, where appropriate, to the application of the existing sectoral
safeguard mechanisms. Such safeguard measures shall not be invoked as a means of arbitrary
discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. The measures shall be
maintained no longer than strictly necessary, and, in any case, will be lifted when the relevant
commitment is implemented. They may however be applied beyond the period specified in the first
paragraph as long as the relevant commitments have not been fulfilled. In response to progress made
by the new Member State concerned in fulfilling its commitments, the Commission may adapt the
measures as appropriate. The Commission shall inform the Council in good time before revoking the
European regulations or decisions establishing the safeguard measures, and it shall take duly into
account any observations of the Council in this respect.954393_TRAITE_EN_301_350

If there are serious shortcomings or any imminent risks of such shortcomings in a new Member State
in the transposition, state of implementation or the application of the framework decisions or any
other relevant commitments, instruments of cooperation and decisions relating to mutual
recognition in the area of criminal law under Title VI of the EU Treaty, Directives and Regulations
relating to mutual recognition in civil matters under Title IV of the EC Treaty, and European laws and
framework laws adopted on the basis of Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the
Constitution, the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three years after 1 May 2004,
upon the motivated request of a Member State or on its own initiative and after consulting the
Member States, adopt European regulations or decisions establishing appropriate measures and
specify the conditions and modalities under which these measures are put into effect.
These measures may take the form of temporary suspension of the application of relevant provisions
and decisions in the relations between a new Member State and any other Member State or Member
States, without prejudice to the continuation of close judicial cooperation. The measures shall be
maintained no longer than strictly necessary, and, in any case, will be lifted when the shortcomings
are remedied. They may however be applied beyond the period specified in the first paragraph as long
as these shortcomings persist. In response to progress made by the new Member State concerned in
rectifying the identified shortcomings, the Commission may adapt the adopted measures as
appropriate after consulting the Member States. The Commission shall inform the Council in good
time before revoking safeguard measures, and it shall take duly into account any observations of the
Council in this respect.
Article 29
In order not to hamper the proper functioning of the internal market, the enforcement of the new
Member States' national rules during the transitional periods referred to in Annexes V to XIV to the
Act of Accession of 16 April 2003 shall not lead to border controls between Member States.
Article 30
If transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the existing regime in the new
Member States to that resulting from the application of the common agricultural policy under the
conditions set out in this Protocol, such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance
with the procedure referred to in Article 42(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June
2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector ( 1 ), or as appropriate, in the
corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation of agricultural markets
or of the European laws replacing them or the relevant procedure as determined in the applicable
legislation. The transitional measures referred to in this Article may be adopted during a period of
three years after 1 May 2004 and their application shall be limited to that period. A European law of
the Council may extend this period. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting the European
Parliament.
