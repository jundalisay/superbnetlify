SECTION 3: JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN CIVIL MATTERS

Article 3-269
1. The Union shall develop judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross‑border implications,
based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and decisions in extrajudicial cases. Such
cooperation may include the adoption of measures for the approximation of the laws and regulations
of the Member States.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, European laws or framework laws shall establish measures,
particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market, aimed at ensuring:
(a) the mutual recognition and enforcement between Member States of judgments and decisions in
extrajudicial cases;
(b) the cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents;
(c) the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning conflict of laws and of
jurisdiction;
(d) cooperation in the taking of evidence;
(e) effective access to justice;
(f) the elimination of obstacles to the proper functioning of civil proceedings, if necessary by
promoting the compatibility of the rules on civil procedure applicable in the Member States;
(g) the development of alternative methods of dispute settlement;
(h) support for the training of the judiciary and judicial staff.
3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, a European law or framework law of the Council shall establish
measures concerning family law with cross-border implications. The Council shall act unanimously
after consulting the European Parliament.
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt a European decision determining those
aspects of family law with cross-border implications which may be the subject of acts adopted by the
ordinary legislative procedure. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting the
European Parliament.

SECTION 4: JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS

Article 3-270

1. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union shall be based on the principle of mutual
recognition of judgments and judicial decisions and shall include the approximation of the laws and
regulations of the Member States in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 and in Article 3-271.
European laws or framework laws shall establish measures to:
(a) lay down rules and procedures for ensuring recognition throughout the Union of all forms of
judgments and judicial decisions;
(b) prevent and settle conflicts of jurisdiction between Member States;
(c) support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff;
(d) facilitate cooperation between judicial or equivalent authorities of the Member States in relation
to proceedings in criminal matters and the enforcement of decisions.
2. To the extent necessary to facilitate mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions and
police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters having a cross‑border dimension, European
framework laws may establish minimum rules. Such rules shall take into account the differences
between the legal traditions and systems of the Member States.
They shall concern:
(a) mutual admissibility of evidence between Member States;
(b) the rights of individuals in criminal procedure;
(c) the rights of victims of crime;
(d) any other specific aspects of criminal procedure which the Council has identified in advance by a
European decision; for the adoption of such a decision, the Council shall act unanimously after
obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
Adoption of the minimum rules referred to in this paragraph shall not prevent Member States from
maintaining or introducing a higher level of protection for individuals.
3. Where a member of the Council considers that a draft European framework law as referred to in
paragraph 2 would affect fundamental aspects of its criminal justice system, it may request that the
draft framework law be referred to the European Council. In that case, the procedure referred to in
Article 3-396 shall be suspended. After discussion, the European Council shall, within four months
of this suspension, either:
(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate the suspension of the procedure
referred to in Article 3-396, or
(b) request the Commission or the group of Member States from which the draft originates to
submit a new draft; in that case, the act originally proposed shall be deemed not to have been
adopted.
4. If, by the end of the period referred to in paragraph 3, either no action has been taken by the
European Council or if, within 12 months from the submission of a new draft under paragraph 3(b),
the European framework law has not been adopted, and at least one third of the Member States wish
to establish enhanced cooperation on the basis of the draft framework law concerned, they shall
notify the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission accordingly.
In such a case, the authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation referred to in Articles I-44(2)
and III-419(1) shall be deemed to be granted and the provisions on enhanced cooperation shall apply.
Article 3-271
1. European framework laws may establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal
offences and sanctions in the areas of particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension
resulting from the nature or impact of such offences or from a special need to combat them on a
common basis.
These areas of crime are the following: terrorism, trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation
of women and children, illicit drug trafficking, illicit arms trafficking, money laundering, corruption,
counterfeiting of means of payment, computer crime and organised crime.
On the basis of developments in crime, the Council may adopt a European decision identifying other
areas of crime that meet the criteria specified in this paragraph. It shall act unanimously after
obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
2. If the approximation of criminal laws and regulations of the Member States proves essential to
ensure the effective implementation of a Union policy in an area which has been subject to
harmonisation measures, European framework laws may establish minimum rules with regard to the
definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area concerned. Such framework laws shall be
adopted by the same procedure as was followed for the adoption of the harmonisation measures in
question, without prejudice to Article 3-264.
3. Where a member of the Council considers that a draft European framework law as referred to in
paragraph 1 or 2 would affect fundamental aspects of its criminal justice system, it may request that
the draft framework law be referred to the European Council. In that case, where the procedure
referred to in Article 3-396 is applicable, it shall be suspended. After discussion, the European
Council shall, within four months of this suspension, either:
(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate the suspension of the procedure
referred to in Article 3-396 where it is applicable, or
(b) request the Commission or the group of Member States from which the draft originates to
submit a new draft; in that case, the act originally proposed shall be deemed not to have been
adopted.
4. If, by the end of the period referred to in paragraph 3, either no action has been taken by the
European Council or if, within 12 months from the submission of a new draft under paragraph 3(b),
the European framework law has not been adopted, and at least one third of the Member States wish
to establish enhanced cooperation on the basis of the draft framework law concerned, they shall
notify the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission accordingly.
In such a case, the authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation referred to in Articles I-44(2)
and III-419(1) shall be deemed to be granted and the provisions on enhanced cooperation shall apply.
Article 3-272
European laws or framework laws may establish measures to promote and support the action of
Member States in the field of crime prevention, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and
regulations of the Member States.
Article 3-273
1. Eurojust's mission shall be to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation between
national investigating and prosecuting authorities in relation to serious crime affecting two or more
Member States or requiring a prosecution on common bases, on the basis of operations conducted
and information supplied by the Member States' authorities and by Europol.
In this context, European laws shall determine Eurojust's structure, operation, field of action and
tasks. Those tasks may include:
(a) the initiation of criminal investigations, as well as proposing the initiation of prosecutions,
conducted by competent national authorities, particularly those relating to offences against the
financial interests of the Union;
(b) the coordination of investigations and prosecutions referred to in point (a);
(c) the strengthening of judicial cooperation, including by resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction and
by close cooperation with the European Judicial Network.
European laws shall also determine arrangements for involving the European Parliament and national
Parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities.
2. In the prosecutions referred to in paragraph 1, and without prejudice to Article 3-274, formal
acts of judicial procedure shall be carried out by the competent national officials.
Article 3-274
1. In order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union, a European law of the
Council may establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust. The Council shall act
unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.
2. The European Public Prosecutor's Office shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and
bringing to judgment, where appropriate in liaison with Europol, the perpetrators of, and
accomplices in, offences against the Union's financial interests, as determined by the European law
provided for in paragraph 1. It shall exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of
the Member States in relation to such offences.
3. The European law referred to in paragraph 1 shall determine the general rules applicable to the
European Public Prosecutor's Office, the conditions governing the performance of its functions, the
rules of procedure applicable to its activities, as well as those governing the admissibility of evidence,
and the rules applicable to the judicial review of procedural measures taken by it in the performance
of its functions.
4. The European Council may, at the same time or subsequently, adopt a European decision
amending paragraph 1 in order to extend the powers of the European Public Prosecutor's Office to
include serious crime having a cross-border dimension and amending accordingly paragraph 2 as
regards the perpetrators of, and accomplices in, serious crimes affecting more than one Member
State. The European Council shall act unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European
Parliament and after consulting the Commission.
