SECTION 8: TRANS-EUROPEAN NETWORKS

Article 3-246
1. To help achieve the objectives referred to in Articles III-130 and III-220 and to enable citizens of
the Union, economic operators and regional and local communities to derive full benefit from the
setting-up of an area without internal frontiers, the Union shall contribute to the establishment and
development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy
infrastructures.
2. Within the framework of a system of open and competitive markets, action by the Union shall
aim at promoting the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to
such networks. It shall take account in particular of the need to link island, landlocked and peripheral
regions with the central regions of the Union.

Article 3-247
1. In order to achieve the objectives referred to in Article 3-246, the Union:
(a) shall establish a series of guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures
envisaged in the sphere of trans‑European networks; these guidelines shall identify projects of
common interest;
(b) shall implement any measures that may prove necessary to ensure the interoperability of the
networks, in particular in the field of technical standardisation;
(c) may support projects of common interest supported by Member States, which are identified in
the framework of the guidelines referred to in point (a), particularly through feasibility studies,
loan guarantees or interest-rate subsidies; the Union may also contribute, through the Cohesion
Fund, to the financing of specific projects in Member States in the area of transport
infrastructure.
The Union's activities shall take into account the potential economic viability of the projects.
2. European laws or framework laws shall establish the guidelines and other measures referred to in
paragraph 1. Such laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Committee of the Regions and the
Economic and Social Committee.

Guidelines and projects of common interest which relate to the territory of a Member State shall
require the agreement of that Member State.
3. Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves the policies
pursued at national level which may have a significant impact on the achievement of the objectives
referred to in Article 3-246. The Commission may, in close cooperation with the Member States,
take any useful initiative to promote such coordination.
4. The Union may cooperate with third countries to promote projects of mutual interest and to
ensure the interoperability of networks.

SECTION 9: RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND SPACE

Article 3-248
1. The Union shall aim to strengthen its scientific and technological bases by achieving a European
research area in which researchers, scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely, and
encourage it to become more competitive, including in its industry, while promoting all the research
activities deemed necessary by virtue of other Chapters of the Constitution.
2. For the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 the Union shall, throughout the Union, encourage
undertakings, including small and medium-sized undertakings, research centres and universities in
their research and technological development activities of high quality. It shall support their efforts to
cooperate with one another, aiming, notably, at permitting researchers to cooperate freely across
borders and at enabling undertakings to exploit the internal market potential, in particular through
the opening-up of national public contracts, the definition of common standards and the removal of
legal and fiscal obstacles to that cooperation.
3. All the Union's activities in the area of research and technological development, including
demonstration projects, shall be decided on and implemented in accordance with this Section.
Article 3-249
In pursuing the objectives referred to in Article 3‑248, the Union shall carry out the following
activities, complementing the activities carried out in the Member States:
(a) implementation of research, technological development and demonstration programmes, by
promoting cooperation with and between undertakings, research centres and universities;
(b) promotion of cooperation in the field of the Union's research, technological development and
demonstration with third countries and international organisations
(c) dissemination and optimisation of the results of activities in the Union's research, technological
development and demonstration;
(d) stimulation of the training and mobility of researchers in the Union.

Article 3-250
1. The Union and the Member States shall coordinate their research and technological development
activities so as to ensure that national policies and the Union's policy are mutually consistent.
2. In close cooperation with the Member States, the Commission may take any useful initiative to
promote the coordination referred to in paragraph 1, in particular initiatives aiming at the
establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the
preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European
Parliament shall be kept fully informed.

Article 3-251
1. European laws shall establish a multiannual framework programme, setting out all the activities
financed by the Union. Such laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social
Committee.
The framework programme shall:
(a) establish the scientific and technological objectives to be achieved by the activities provided for in
Article 3-249 and lay down the relevant priorities;
(b) indicate the broad lines of such activities;
(c) lay down the maximum overall amount and the detailed rules for the Union's financial
participation in the framework programme and the respective shares in each of the activities
provided for.
2. The multiannual framework programme shall be adapted or supplemented as the situation
changes.
3. A European law of the Council shall establish specific programmes to implement the
multiannual framework programme within each activity. Each specific programme shall define the
detailed rules for implementing it, fix its duration and provide for the means deemed necessary. The
sum of the amounts deemed necessary, fixed in the specific programmes, shall not exceed the overall
maximum amount fixed for the framework programme and each activity. Such a law shall be adopted
after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.
4. As a complement to the activities planned in the multiannual framework programme, European
laws shall establish the measures necessary for the implementation of the European research area.
Such laws shall be adopted after consulting the Economic and Social Committee.

Article 3-252
1. For the implementation of the multiannual framework programme, European laws or
framework laws shall establish:
(a) the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities;
(b) the rules governing the dissemination of research results.
Such European laws or framework laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and
Social Committee.
2. In implementing the multiannual framework programme, European laws may establish
supplementary programmes involving the participation of certain Member States only, which shall
finance them subject to possible participation by the Union.
Such European laws shall determine the rules applicable to supplementary programmes, particularly
as regards the dissemination of knowledge as well as access by other Member States. They shall be
adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee and with the agreement of the
Member States concerned.
3. In implementing the multiannual framework programme, European laws may make provision,
in agreement with the Member States concerned, for participation in research and development
programmes undertaken by several Member States, including participation in the structures created
for the execution of those programmes.
Such European laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.
4. In implementing the multiannual framework programme the Union may make provision for
cooperation in the Union's research, technological development and demonstration with
