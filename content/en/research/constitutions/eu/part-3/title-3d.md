SECTION 5: RULES ON COMPETITION

Subsection 1
Rules applying to undertakings

Article 3-161
1. The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements
between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may
affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention,
restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:
(a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;
(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;
(c) share markets or sources of supply;
(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing
them at a competitive disadvantage;
(e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary
obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with
the subject of such contracts.
2. Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall be automatically void.
3. Paragraph 1 may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of:
— any agreement or category of agreements between undertakings,
— any decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings,
— any concerted practice or category of concerted practices,
which contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or
economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does
not:
(a) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment
of these objectives;
(b) afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part
of the products in question.

Article 3-162
Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a
substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market insofar as it may
affect trade between Member States.
Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:
(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading
conditions;
(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;
(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby
placing them at a competitive disadvantage;
(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary
obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with
the subject of such contracts.

Article 3-163
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the European regulations to give effect
to the principles set out in Articles III‑161 and III‑162. It shall act after consulting the
European Parliament. 

Such regulations shall be designed in particular:
(a) to ensure compliance with the prohibitions laid down in Article 3-161(1) and in Article 3-162
by making provision for fines and periodic penalty payments;
(b) to lay down detailed rules for the application of Article 3-161(3), taking into account the need to
ensure effective supervision on the one hand, and to simplify administration to the greatest
possible extent on the other;
(c) to define, if need be, in the various branches of the economy, the scope of Articles III-161 and III-
162;
(d) to define the respective functions of the Commission and of the Court of Justice of the European
Union in applying the provisions laid down in this paragraph;
(e) to determine the relationship between Member States' laws and this Subsection as well as the
European regulations adopted pursuant to this Article.

Article 3-164
Until the entry into force of the European regulations adopted pursuant to Article 3-163, the
authorities in Member States shall rule on the admissibility of agreements, decisions and concerted
practices and on abuse of a dominant position in the internal market in accordance with their
national law and Article 3-161, in particular paragraph 3, and Article 3-162.

Article 3-165
1. Without prejudice to Article 3-164, the Commission shall ensure the application of the
principles set out in Articles III-161 and III-162. On application by a Member State or on its own
initiative, and in cooperation with the competent authorities in the Member States, which shall give it
their assistance, the Commission shall investigate cases of suspected infringement of these principles.
If it finds that there has been an infringement, it shall propose appropriate measures to bring it to an
end.
2. If the infringement referred to in paragraph 1 is not brought to an end, the Commission shall
adopt a reasoned European decision recording the infringement of the principles. The Commission
may publish its decision and authorise Member States to take the measures, the conditions and details
of which it shall determine, needed to remedy the situation.
3. The Commission may adopt European regulations relating to the categories of agreement in
respect of which the Council has adopted a European regulation pursuant to Article 3-163, second
paragraph, (b).
Article 3-166
1. In the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or
exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the
Constitution, in particular Article I-4(2) and Articles III-161 to III-169.
2. Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the
character of an income-producing monopoly shall be subject to the provisions of the Constitution, in
particular to the rules on competition, insofar as the application of such provisions does not obstruct
the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them. The development of trade
must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the Union's interests.
3. The Commission shall ensure the application of this Article and shall, where necessary, adopt
appropriate European regulations or decisions.
Subsection 2
Aid granted by Member States
Article 3-167
1. Save as otherwise provided in the Constitution, any aid granted by a Member State or through
State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by
favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade
between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.
2. The following shall be compatible with the internal market: 
(a) aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is granted
without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;
(b) aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;
(c) aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the
division of Germany, insofar as such aid is required in order to compensate for the economic
disadvantages caused by that division. Five years after the entry into force of the Treaty
establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission,
may adopt a European decision repealing this point.
3.
The following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market:
(a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally
low or where there is serious underemployment, and of the regions referred to in Article 3-424,
in view of their structural, economic and social situation;
(b) aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy
a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State;
(c) aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas,
where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common
interest
(d) aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect trading
conditions and competition in the Union to an extent that is contrary to the common interest;
(e) such other categories of aid as may be specified by European regulations or decisions adopted by
the Council on a proposal from the Commission.

Article 3-168
1. The Commission, in cooperation with Member States, shall keep under constant review all
systems of aid existing in those States. It shall propose to the latter any appropriate measures required
by the progressive development or by the functioning of the internal market.
2. If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds
that aid granted by a Member State or through State resources is not compatible with the internal
market having regard to Article 3-167, or that such aid is being misused, it shall adopt a European
decision requiring the Member State concerned to abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to
be determined by the Commission.

If the Member State concerned does not comply with this European decision within the prescribed
time, the Commission or any other interested Member State may, in derogation from Articles III-360
and III-361, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union directly.
On application by a Member State, the Council may adopt unanimously a European decision that aid
which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the internal
market, in derogation from Article 3-167 or from European regulations provided for in Article 3-
169, if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in question, the
Commission has already initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this
paragraph, the fact that the Member State concerned has made its application to the Council shall
have the effect of suspending that procedure until the Council has made its attitude known.
If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within three months of the said application
being made, the Commission shall act.
3. The Commission shall be informed by the Member States, in sufficient time to enable it to
submit its comments, of any plans to grant or alter aid. If it considers that any such plan is not
compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 3-167, it shall without delay initiate the
procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article. The Member State concerned shall not put its
proposed measures into effect until this procedure has resulted in a final decision.
4. The Commission may adopt European regulations relating to the categories of State aid that the
Council has, pursuant to Article 3-169, determined may be exempted from the procedure provided
for by paragraph 3 of this Article.

Article 3-169
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt European regulations for the
application of Articles III-167 and III-168 and for determining in particular the conditions in which
Article 3-168(3) shall apply and the categories of aid exempted from the procedure provided for in
Article 168(3). It shall act after consulting the European Parliament.
