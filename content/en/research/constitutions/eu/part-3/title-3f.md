CHAPTER 2: ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICY

Article 3-177
For the purposes set out in Article I-3, the activities of the Member States and the Union shall
include, as provided in the Constitution, the adoption of an economic policy which is based on the
close coordination of Member States' economic policies, on the internal market and on the definition
of common objectives, and conducted in accordance with the principle of an open market economy
with free competition.
Concurrently with the foregoing, and as provided in the Constitution and in accordance with the
procedures set out therein, these activities shall include a single currency, the euro, and the definition
and conduct of a single monetary policy and exchange-rate policy, the primary objective of both of
which shall be to maintain price stability and, without prejudice to this objective, to support general
economic policies in the Union, in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with
free competition.
These activities of the Member States and the Union shall entail compliance with the following
guiding principles: stable prices, sound public finances and monetary conditions and a stable balance
of payments.

SECTION 1: ECONOMIC POLICY

Article 3-178

Member States shall conduct their economic policies in order to contribute to the achievement of the
Union's objectives, as defined in Article I-3, and in the context of the broad guidelines referred to in
Article 3-179(2). The Member States and the Union shall act in accordance with the principle of an
open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources, and in
compliance with the principles set out in Article 3-177.

Article 3-179
1. Member States shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and shall
coordinate them within the Council, in accordance with Article 3-178.
2. The Council, on a recommendation from the Commission, shall formulate a draft for the broad
guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union, and shall report its
findings to the European Council.
The European Council, on the basis of the report from the Council, shall discuss a conclusion on the
broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union. On the basis of
this conclusion, the Council shall adopt a recommendation setting out these broad guidelines. It shall
inform the European Parliament of its recommendation.
3. In order to ensure closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of the
economic performances of the Member States, the Council, on the basis of reports submitted by the
Commission, shall monitor economic developments in each of the Member States and in the Union,
as well as the consistency of economic policies with the broad guidelines referred to in paragraph 2,
and shall regularly carry out an overall assessment.
For the purpose of this multilateral surveillance, Member States shall forward information to the
Commission on important measures taken by them in the field of their economic policy and such
other information as they deem necessary.
4. Where it is established, under the procedure referred to in paragraph 3, that the economic
policies of a Member State are not consistent with the broad guidelines referred to in paragraph 2
or that they risk jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, the
Commission may address a warning to the Member State concerned. The Council, on a
recommendation from the Commission, may address the necessary recommendations to the
Member State concerned. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide to make its
recommendations public.
Within the scope of this paragraph, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of the
member of the Council representing the Member State concerned.
A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the other members of the Council,
representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the population of the participating
Member States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of these other Council members
representing more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one
member, failing which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.
5. The President of the Council and the Commission shall report to the European Parliament on the
results of multilateral surveillance. The President of the Council may be invited to appear before the
competent committee of the European Parliament if the Council has made its recommendations
public.
6. European laws may lay down detailed rules for the multilateral surveillance procedure referred to
in paragraphs 3 and 4.

Article 3-180
1. Without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in the Constitution, the Council, on a
proposal from the Commission, may adopt a European decision laying down measures appropriate
to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products.
2. Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused
by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from
the Commission, may adopt a European decision granting, under certain conditions, Union financial
assistance to the Member State concerned. The President of the Council shall inform the
European Parliament of the decision adopted.

Article 3-181
1. Overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the European Central Bank or with the
central banks of the Member States (hereinafter referred to as ‘national central banks’) in favour of
Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public
authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States shall be
prohibited, as shall the purchase directly from them by the European Central Bank or national central
banks of debt instruments.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to publicly owned credit institutions which, in the context of the
supply of reserves by central banks, shall be given the same treatment by national central banks and
the European Central Bank as private credit institutions.

Article 3-182
Any measure or provision, not based on prudential considerations, establishing privileged access by
Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public
authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States to
financial institutions shall be prohibited.
Article 3-183
1. The Union shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments, regional,
local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of any
Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific
project. A Member State shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments,
regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public
undertakings of another Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint
execution of a specific project.
2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt European regulations or decisions
specifying definitions for the application of the prohibitions laid down in Articles III-181 and III-182
and in this Article. It shall act after consulting the European Parliament.

Article 3-184
1. Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
2. The Commission shall monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of
government debt in the Member States in order to identify gross errors. In particular it shall examine
compliance with budgetary discipline on the basis of the following two criteria:
(a) whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds
a reference value, unless:
(i) either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes
close to the reference value, or
(ii) alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the
ratio remains close to the reference value;
(b) whether the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless
the ratio is diminishing sufficiently and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.
The reference values are specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.
3. If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both of these criteria, the
Commission shall prepare a report. The Commission's report shall also take into account whether the
government deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and take into account all other
relevant factors, including the medium‑term economic and budgetary position of the Member State.
The Commission may also prepare a report if, notwithstanding the fulfilment of the requirements
under the criteria, it is of the opinion that there is a risk of an excessive deficit in a Member State.
4. The Economic and Financial Committee set up under Article 3-192 shall formulate an opinion
on the Commission's report.
5. If the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it
shall address an opinion to the Member State concerned and shall inform the Council accordingly.
6. The Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, having considered any observations
which the Member State concerned may wish to make and after an overall assessment, decide
whether an excessive deficit exists. In that case it shall adopt, without undue delay, on a
recommendation from the Commission, recommendations addressed to the Member State concerned
with a view to bringing that situation to an end within a given period. Subject to paragraph 8, those
recommendations shall not be made public.
Within the scope of this paragraph, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of the
member of the Council representing the Member State concerned.
A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the other members of the Council,
representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the population of the participating Member
States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of these other Council members
representing more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one
member, failing which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.
7. The Council, on a recommendation from the Commission, shall adopt the European decisions
and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 8 to 11.
It shall act without taking into account the vote of the member of the Council representing the
Member State concerned.
A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the other members of the Council,
representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the population of the participating Member
States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of these other Council members
representing more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one
member, failing which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.
8. Where it adopts a European decision establishing that there has been no effective action in
response to its recommendations within the period laid down, the Council may make its
recommendations public.
9. If a Member State persists in failing to put the Council's recommendations into practice, the
Council may adopt a European decision giving notice to the Member State to take, within a specified
time-limit, measures for the deficit reduction which the Council judges necessary to remedy the
situation.
In such a case, the Council may request the Member State concerned to submit reports in accordance
with a specific timetable in order to examine the adjustment efforts of that Member State.
10. As long as a Member State fails to comply with a European decision adopted in accordance with
paragraph 9, the Council may decide to apply or, as the case may be, intensify one or more of the
following measures:
(a) require the Member State concerned to publish additional information, to be specified by the
Council, before issuing bonds and securities;
(b) invite the European Investment Bank to reconsider its lending policy towards the Member State
concerned;
(c) require the Member State concerned to make a non-interest-bearing deposit of an appropriate
size with the Union until the Council considers that the excessive deficit has been corrected;
(d) impose fines of an appropriate size.
The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the measures adopted.
11. The Council shall repeal some or all of the measures referred to in paragraph 6 and
paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 if it considers the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned to have
been corrected. If the Council has previously made public recommendations, it shall state publicly,
as soon as the European decision referred to in paragraph 8 has been repealed, that there is no longer
an excessive deficit in the Member State concerned.
12. The rights to bring actions provided for in Articles III-360 and III-361 shall not be exercised
within the framework of paragraphs 1 to 6 or paragraphs 8 and 9.
13. Further provisions relating to the implementation of the procedure laid down in this Article are
set out in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.
A European law of the Council shall lay down the appropriate measures to replace the said Protocol.
The Council shall act unanimously after consulting the European Parliament and the European
Central Bank.
Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission,
shall adopt European regulations or decisions laying down detailed rules and definitions for the
application of the said Protocol. It shall act after consulting the European Parliament.
