SECTION 4: CAPITAL AND PAYMENTS

Article 3-156
Within the framework of this Section, restrictions both on the movement of capital and on payments
between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited.
Article 3-157
1. Article 3-156 shall be without prejudice to the application to third countries of any restrictions
which existed on 31 December 1993 under national or Union law adopted in respect of the
movement of capital to or from third countries involving direct investment — including investment
in real estate, establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to
capital markets. With regard to restrictions which exist under national law in Estonia and Hungary,
the date in question shall be 31 December 1999.
2. European laws or framework laws shall enact measures on the movement of capital to or from
third countries involving direct investment — including investment in real estate, establishment, the
provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets.
The European Parliament and the Council shall endeavour to achieve the objective of free movement
of capital between Member States and third countries to the greatest extent possible and without
prejudice to other provisions of the Constitution.
3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, only a European law or framework law of the Council may enact
measures which constitute a step backwards in Union law as regards the liberalisation of the
movement of capital to or from third countries. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting
the European Parliament.
Article 3-158
1. Article 3-156 shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States:
(a) to apply the relevant provisions of their tax law which distinguish between taxpayers who are not
in the same situation with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where
their capital is invested;
(b) to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements of national provisions laid down by law or
regulation, in particular in the field of taxation and the prudential supervision of financial
institutions, or to lay down procedures for the declaration of capital movements for purposes of
administrative or statistical information, or to take measures which are justified on grounds of
public policy or public security.
2. This Section shall be without prejudice to the applicability of restrictions on the right of
establishment which are compatible with the Constitution.
3. The measures and procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not constitute a means of
arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on the free movement of capital and payments as
defined in Article 3-156.
4. In the absence of a European law or framework law provided for in Article 3-157(3), the
Commission or, in the absence of a European decision of the Commission within three months from
the request of the Member State concerned, the Council, may adopt a European decision stating that
restrictive tax measures adopted by a Member State concerning one or more third countries are to be
considered compatible with the Constitution insofar as they are justified by one of the objectives of
the Union and compatible with the proper functioning of the internal market. The Council shall act
unanimously on application by a Member State.
Article 3-159
Where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital to or from third countries cause, or
threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the functioning of economic and monetary union, the
Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt European regulations or decisions
introducing safeguard measures with regard to third countries for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary. It shall act after consulting the European Central Bank.

Article 3-160

Where necessary to achieve the objectives set out in Article 3-257, as regards preventing and
combating terrorism and related activities, European laws shall define a framework for administrative
measures with regard to capital movements and payments, such as the freezing of funds, financial
assets or economic gains belonging to, or owned or held by, natural or legal persons, groups or non-
State entities.
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt European regulations or European
decisions in order to implement the European laws referred to in the first paragraph.
The acts referred to in this Article shall include necessary provisions on legal safeguards.
