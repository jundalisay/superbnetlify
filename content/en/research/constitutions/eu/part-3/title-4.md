European Union.
Article 3-434
The Union shall enjoy in the territories of the Member States such privileges and immunities as are
necessary for the performance of its tasks, under the conditions laid down in the Protocol on the
privileges and immunities of the European Union.
Article 3-435
The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding
States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and
one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the Constitution.
To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Constitution, the Member State or
States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established.
Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate,
adopt a common attitude.
In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account
the fact that the advantages accorded under the Constitution by each Member State form an integral
part of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of institutions on which
powers have been conferred by the Constitution and the granting of identical advantages by all the
other Member States.
Article 3-436

essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms,

competition in the internal market regarding products which are not intended for specifically
military purposes.
2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may unanimously adopt a European decision
making changes to the list of 15 April 1958 of the products to which the provisions of paragraph 1
(b) apply.
