## Article 51

Field of application

1. The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. 

They shall therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers and respecting the limits of the powers of the Union as conferred on it in the Treaties.

2. The Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties.


## Article 52

Scope and interpretation of rights and principles

1. Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be
provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of
proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of
general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.
2.
Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in the Treaties shall be exercised
under the conditions and within the limits defined by those Treaties.
3.
In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and
scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This
provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.
4.
In so far as this Charter recognises fundamental rights as they result from the constitutional
traditions common to the Member States, those rights shall be interpreted in harmony with
those traditions.7.6.2016

5.
The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and
executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of Member
States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers. They shall
be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their legality.
6.
Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter.
7.
The explanations drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of this Charter
shall be given due regard by the courts of the Union and of the Member States.

Article 53: Level of protection

Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their respective fields of application, by Union law and
international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States
are party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, and by the Member States' constitutions.

Article 54: Prohibition of abuse of rights

Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or to
perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised in this Charter
or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for herein.

The above text adapts the wording of the Charter proclaimed on 7 December 2000, and will replace
it as from the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
