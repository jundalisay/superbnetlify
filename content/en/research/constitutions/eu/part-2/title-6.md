impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised,

Article 49

Principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties
1.
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which
did not constitute a criminal offence under national law or international law at the time when it was
committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the
criminal offence was committed. If, subsequent to the commission of a criminal offence, the law
provides for a lighter penalty, that penalty shall be applicable.
2.
This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission
which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles
recognised by the community of nations.
3.
The severity of penalties must not be disproportionate to the criminal offence.C 202/404
