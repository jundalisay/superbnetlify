Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Acts of the appropriate Legislature may regulate the recruitment, and
conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of
the Union or of any State:

Provided that it shall be competent for the President or such person as he may direct in the case of
services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, and for the Governor 2 *** of a State or such
person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the State, to make
rules regulating the recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed, to such services and

article, and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act.

office during the pleasure of the President, and every person who is a member of a civil service of a State
or holds any civil post under a State holds office during the pleasure of the Governor 3 *** of the State.
(2) Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil post under the Union or a State holds office during
the pleasure of the President or, as the case may be, of the Governor 1 *** of the State, any contract under
which a person, not being a member of a defence service or of an all-India service or of a civil service of
the Union or a State, is appointed under this Constitution to hold such a post may, if the President or the
Governor 4 ***, as the case may be, deems it necessary in order to secure the services of a person having
special qualifications, provide for the payment to him of compensation, if before the expiration of an
agreed period that post is abolished or he is, for reasons not connected with any misconduct on his part,
required to vacate that post.

Union or a State.—(1) No person who is a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service

[(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an
inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of
being heard in respect of those charges 6 ***:

penalty may be imposed on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry and it shall not be
necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed:

Parliament to vary or revoke, after his appointment to such post, the conditions of his service to his
disadvantage except in so far as such conditions of service are applicable to him by reason of his being
a person appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the

(a) any dispute arising out of any provision of, or any endorsement on, any covenant, agreement or
