Money supply makes all things dear or cheap. This money is either gotten or lost in foreign trade by the over or under-balancing of foreign trade.

<!-- I now distinguish the plenties of mony from that which is only substantial and able to preform the work.
For there are diverse ways to get money into a nation, which impoverish it through several inconveniences. -->

If we melt down our gold into coin, it would create a lot of money for a time. But we would not be richer. This money will be sent overseas if we= 
- buy too many foreign goods, or
- maintain a war where we supply our armies with foreign goods bought with our money.

If we devalue our own coins to bring in foreign coins, it would bring in money into the country. But we would not be richer because the money will not stay long with us.

If a merchant brings in this foreign money for goods sent out already. This does not help us because the goods carried out will be more valuable and we will lose when we balance our accounts.

The conclusion is that the balance of our foreign trade brings our nation money. Our lands improve only by this plenty of money through foreign trade.

When the Merchant is able to sell his goods overseas, he returns to buy more local goods. This raises the price of our local commodities, and consequently improves the landlords' rents as the leases expire daily.  This money, gained by the nation, enables many men to buy lands and make them the dearer. 

But if our foreign trade declines by the neglect at home or injuries abroad, the merchants will be impoverished. Less of the nation's goods will be sold and such benefits will cease. Our land prices will fall daily.
