Is Treasuring by the Prince necessary?

Some people depend so much on their rulers that they call it baseness for their Prince to keep Treasure. They prefer that their Prince rely on the produce of the land instead of money, as proven in Caesar, Alexander, and others who achieved victories by lavish gifts and liberal expences.

They say that King David's money passed on to Solomon was used mostly for pomp and vain delights, except the ones spent to build the Temple.

Whereupon (say they) if so much treasure gathered by so just a King, effect so little, what shall we hope for by the endeavours of this kind in other Princes?

- Sardanapalus left £10,000,000 to them that slew him. 
- Darius left £20,000,000 to Alexander that took him. 
- Nero being left rich, and extoring much from his best Subjects, gave away over £12,000,000 to his base flatterers and such unworthy persons, which caused Galba after him to revoke those gifts.

Princes who amass treasure usually source it from the spoils of their Enemies than out of their own Coffers. A Prince has a cache of money hates peace, the friendship of his Neighbours and Allies. He enters into necessary and dangerous Wars to his own ruin and overthrow.

Whereas on the contrary, those Princes who have no treasure or savings will eventually come to want and misery.<!--  which do not providently lay up Treasure, or do immoderately consume the same when they have it, will sodainly --> 

<!-- All which, with divers other weak arguments of this kind, (which for brevity I omit) make nothing against the lawful gathering and massing up of Treasure by , if they be rightly understood. -->

<!-- For first, concerning those worthies who have obtained to the highest top of honour and dignity, by their great gifts and expences, who know not that this hath been done rather upon the , which is indeed a Bounty that causeth neither loss nor peril? -->

Excessive treasure soon decays because of the lack of means to use it anyway.  This was King Solomons case. He had infinite Treasure, which made him overburden his Subjects. This made them rebel against his Son Rehoboam who thereby lost a great part of his dominions, being so grossly misled by his young Counsellors.

Therefore, to avoid Contempt, Hate, and Danger, a Prince must have savings and be thrifty. This will prevent him from oppressing his people, and yet maintain his Estate without going into Poverty, The rule is that when more revenue is needed than is what is provided by the ordinary taxes, it should be sourced with equality to avoid the people's hate<!--  of the , who are never pleased except their contributions be granted by general consent -->.

<!-- for further proof whereof I might yet produce some other examples, which here I do omit as needless. -->
The invention of Parliaments is an excellent policy to this end. It keeps a sweet concord between a King and his Subjects, by restraining the Insolency of the Nobility, and redressing the Injuries of the Commons, without making a Prince adhere to either party.

<!-- There could nothing be devised with more judgement for the common quiet of a Kingdom, or with greater care for the safety of a King, who hereby hath also good means to dispatch those things by others, which will move envy, and to execute that himself which will merit thanks.
