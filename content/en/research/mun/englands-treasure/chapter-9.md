The discreet Merchant [trade financer] carefully learns the value of the foreign money that he receives according to their weight and fineness compared to ours. This will help him know his profits or losses.

We sell our valuable goods to diverse places that have nothing useful to sell to us. That's why we require payment in ready money. We then use this money to buy the useful goods of other Countries. It can even be melted down to be minted into our coin. However, this last method will increase our Treasure very little because= 

1. Other countries will do the same with their money to counteract ours

2. The increase in our circulating money would make it lose value relative to foreign coins 

3. If our currency is slightly more valuable than foreign coins, it will not make much of a difference because the merchant will use whatever money is good for importation

<!-- First, the toleration it self doth break the laws of entercourse, and would soon move other Princes to perform the same acts or worse against us, and so frustrate our hopes. 

Secondly, if money be the true measure of all our other means, and forraign Coins tollerated to pass current amongst us, at higher rates than they are worth (being compared our Standard) it followeth that the common wealth shall not be justly distributed, when it passeth by a false measure. 

Thirdly, if the advantage between ours and forraign coins be but small, it will bring in little or no Treasure, because the Merchant will rather bring in wares upon which there is usually a competent gain. -->

On the other hand, if we permit a great advantage to the foreign coins, then our sterling mony would go overseas. Therefore, monetary policy is fruitless. The important thing is the balance of trade through fiscal and trade policy. 

<!--  , and so I leave this business in a Dilemma, and fruitless, as all other course will ever prove which seek for the gain or loss of our treasure out of the ballance of our general forraign trade, as I will endeavour yet further to demonstrate.
