## 33. Mosul (Wussili)

Mosul has many rocky mountains. In autumn, there falls a heavy dew, which, under the action of the sun's rays, hardens into a substance like powdered sugar. 

This is gathered and is a a sweet, pleasant tasting food with purifying and cooling properties. It is real kanlu. 

The mountains of Mosul has a tree which bears chestnuts in the first year called pulu. The next year, moshi grow on it.

Asbestos cloth and coral are native products.
