## 23. Mecca

Mecca can be reached by 80 days land westward travel from Basra (Malopa). 

This is where Mohammad was born. In the house of God, the walls are made of precious stones of every colour. 

During the death anniversary of Mohammad, all the Arabs gather here where they bring presents of gold, silver, jewels and precious stones. Then the House is adorned anew with silk brocade.

Farther there is the tomb of the Buddha. Continually by day and night, the tomb has such a brilliant refulgence that no one can approach it otherwise they go blind. 

Anyone who rubs his breast in the hour of his death with dirt taken from his tomb, they say, will be restored to life again by the power of the Buddha.

## 24. Bandar Abbas (Tsongpa)


Bandar Abbas is on an island of the sea south of Gujarat. It has a great mountain to the West.

The Arabs wrap themselves in blue foreign cotton stuffs  and wear red leather shoes. 

Their daily food consists of meal, baked cakes and mutton.

There are many villages, and a succession of wooded hills and terraced rocks. 

The climate is warm, and there is no cold season.


Their exports are:
- elephants' tusks
- native gold
- ambergris
- yellow sandal-wood

Every year, Gujarat and the Arabs send ships to trade here with:

- white cotton cloth
- porcelain
- copper
- red cotton
