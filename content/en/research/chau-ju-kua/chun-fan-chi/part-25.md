Mu-hiang comes from the country of Ma-lo-mo of the Arabs/ It is also found in Shi-ho and Nu-fa. 

The plant resembles the Chinese ssi-kua (Luffa cylindrica, Koem.). 

The root is gathered during the winter months. These are chopped into pieces of 1-2 inches in length and sun-dried.

Pieces like a chicken bone are of the best quality.

<!-- Note.
Ma-lo-mo is Merbat, SM-lio is Shehr, and Nu-fa is Ziifar, the modern Dhofar, all on the
ID Hadramaut coast of Arabia. See supra, p. 116. Our author also states (supra, p. 128) that mu-hiang
came from the Somali coast (Pi-p'a-lo); but the best quality of the drug came, he says (supra, p. 98)
from Nan-ni-hua-lo, which we think must be identified with Sindh, or a section of that region. Our
author is wrong in stating that this product was found in Hadramaut and on the Somali coast. It
is a native of Kashmere and was an important export from the ports of Sindh, when the author
15 of the Periplus wrote, and probably ages before his time, as it was well known to the Hebrews who
called it Icetgiofh (niV'Sp cassia), which, we presume, is derived from its Sanskrit name, IcusMlia, which
the original of the Greek xoffTo?, and the Latin eostus. In Malay it is called pueho, which may
be the origin of our putchuk, or our term may be derived ivomputchok, by which name this root is
known in Calcutta. Putchuck is the root oftheAucklandia eostus, Royle. Hamilton, New Account

## 26. CARDAMOMS 

Pai-tou-kou come from Cambodia, Java, <!--  Chon-la, Sho-p'o --> and other foreign countries.

Cambodia produces them in the largest quantity. 

The plant resembles the ssi-kua and the seed of a grape. It is a creeping plant fond of deep valleys. It blossoms in the spring and ripens in the summer. The people are allowed to gather it freely.

Amomum cardamomum, is a native plant of Cambodia, Thailand, and Java.

## 27. PEPPER

Hu-tsiau comes from the following places in Java:
- Sukitan
- Ta-pan
- Pai-hua-yiian
- Ma-tung
- Jung-ya-lu

But the pepper coming from Sunda Indonesia<!-- Sinto --> is the best. The Ta-pan variety takes the second place.

Pepper grows in the uncultivated wilds, and the villages in the countryside. 
<!-- the Chinese grape. -->


The natives grow it on frames made of bamboo. The flower opens, and in the fourth moon the fruit forms. 

The flower resembles a fong-wei or a phoemx-tail and is blue and red in colour. 

The grains are gathered in the fifth moon, dried in the sun, and stored in godowns, whence they are withdrawn in the following year, carts drawn by oxen being used to transport them to the market. 

The grain cannot stand the sun, but stands rain. Therefore, crops are but poor after dry weather, whereas heavy rainfalls may double the ordinary yield of the harvest.

Nan-p'i which appears in his work (supra, pp. 88, 90, n. 8) under the name of Ma-li-mo (in Amoy

presumably because nearly, if not all, the pepper trade of China in his days was with the Indian
Archipelago.
noteworthy that Ch6u K'u-fei is the first Chinese author to mention pepper as a
product of the Indian Archipelago; the Arab traders of the ninth and tenth centuries speak
45 only of the pepper of India. Ibn Khordadbeh knew that pepper was produced in Ceylon, but his
information went no farther; the one source of supply was, for him, Malabar. As showing the great

shipload of pepper that goes to Alexandria or elsewhere, destined for Christendom, there come a
hundred such, aye and more too, to this haven of Zaytun». Duarte Barbosa, op. cit, 206,
mentions also the great quantity of pepper used in China. See on the pepper trade in the Middle
Ages, Heyd, Hist, du Commerce, -->
