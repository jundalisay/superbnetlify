Oman (Yung-man) resembles Wupa in terms of its people and soil. 

Their chief wears a turban and wraps himself in light silk but wears no garments and goes barefoot. 

His servants wear no headdress and go barefoot. They wrap themselves in sarongs <!-- so that the body is covered -->.

They live on meal cakes, mutton, sheep's milk, fish and vegetables. 

The soil produces dates in large quantities. 

Along the coast, pearls are found. In the mountains, horse raising is done on a large scale.

The other countries purchase horses, pearls and dates for cloves, cardamom seeds and camphor.

water tanks had been constructed, and on the neighbouring sea-banks was the famous pearl
