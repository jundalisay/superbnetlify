<!-- comes to Western India
the Southern Yin-tu is  distant -->

This country had not from olden times carried on trade with China. Its distance to Canton by water is around 411,400 li. 

To get here, you must change ships at Kulin, or travel by Pukan.  

Chola has a city with a 7-fold wall, 7-feet high and 12 li north-south and 7 li east-west.

When anyone commits an offense, one of the
Court Ministers punishes him. If the offense is light, the culprit is tied to a wooden frame and given fifty, seventy, or up to an hundred blows with a stick.

Heinous crimes are punished with decapitation or by being
trampled to death by an elephant.

Chola is at war with the Chakulayas. The government owns 60,000 war elephants, each one 7-8 feet high. When fighting, these elephants carry on their backs houses full of soldiers who shoot arrows at long range and fight with spears at close quarters.

When victorious, the elephants are granted honorary names to signahze their merits. The people are hot-tempered and reckless of life. In the presence of the king, they will fight man to man with swords and die without regret.

The common people are combative and devoted solely to robbery. They use pieces of white conch shells ground into shape as money.

information concerning this mission from one and the same written source. Ma and the Sung-shl

The Sung-shi says that the principal envoy from Chu-lien was called So-li San-won. 

After leaving Chola India, they sailed for 77 days, passing the islands of Na-wu-tan and So-li Si-lan and came to the country of Chan-pin. From there, they went 61 days passing the island of Imaloli and came to the country of Kulo.

Proceeding again 71 days, passing the island of Kiapa, Chan-pulau or Ku-pulau to Sumatra. 18 days more they headed to the Man-shan river and the Tienchu islands, arriving in Pintoulang headland

the Chu-lien vassalage to San-fo-ts'i was given by the Burmese envoys as a reason for asking
greater privileges at the Chinese court than they had received. See supra, p. 23.
