### Andaman (Yentoman)

When sailing from Lan-wu-li to silan, ships might be driven to Andaman if the wind is not fair.

It is made up of 2 islands= one large which is 70 li around, one small and uninhabited. 

Its people are black skinned and eat men alive. This is why sailors do not anchor here. 

Its people use shells with ground edges instead of knives. They have a relic of a corpse on a bed of rolling gold. This body has not decayed and there is always a huge snake guarding it. 
whose body hair has grown to the length of two near it.

K'un-lun-ts'ong-k'i or 'The Zanj (or Blacks) from K'un-lun'. Considering the position
assigned this island, near the island of the rue (Madagascar), the use of the name Ts'ong for its
1)
inhabitants which we have previously' seen (supra, p. 126, 130) was given to the blacks from the
20 Somali coast to the Mozanbique channel, considering further the similarity of sound between the
name used by the Arabs of the time to designate the big island of Pemba, Kanbalu, we have little
doubt that the Chinese name means the cZanj of Kanbalu». Ch6u K'ii-fei (for all of the first and
second paragraphs, and half of the third are taken from his work, 3,6*) used probably the characters
K'un-lun to transcribe the name Kanbalu, because he saw some connexion between these blacks
25 in the West, with the negritos inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and the islands of the Archipelago,
who were known to the Chinese of his time as 'K'un-lun slaves'. See supra, p. 31, n. 2.
The bird pong is the rukh, or rue of mediaeval writers; the story may have had its origin
in the Indian legend of the garuda. The localization of the rue in Madagascar was probably due
to the presence there of the fossil eggs of the gigantic fossil Aepyornis. The rue's quills are,
30 according to Sir John Kirk and Sir Henry Yule, the fronds of the rofia or raphia palm. See The
Academy, March 22, 1884. According to Gabriel Ferrand (Journal Asiatique, 10* serie, X, 551)
they are the Malgash lavgana. The langana is a big bamboo, about 15 centimetres in diameter and
2 meters long, in which the knots have been perforated with the exception of the one at the
end, so as to turn it into a water-vessel. The langana is used by a large number of tribes, and
35 particularly by the coast tribes (of Madagascar).
Marco Polo (II, 405) also says of the rue that

### Shahuakung

The Sha-hua-kung are pirates and plunderers of the high seas. They sell their prisoners to Java. 

Southeast from this country are islands inhabited by savage robbers called Malonu. 

When traders are driven to this country, these savages assemble in large crowds. They catch the shipwrecked, roast them over a fire with large bamboo pinchers and eat them.

The chiefs of these robbers bore their teeth and plate them with yellow gold. They use human skulls as vessels for drinking and eating. 

The more one penetrates these islands, the worse the robbers are.

The name Ma-lo-nu is very like Malayu, our Malay, but we are not aware that that

brass studs in the front teeth and of covering them with gold plates is still adhered to among
certain tribes in Borneo and Sumatra. See W. H. Furness, Home life of Borneo head-hunters,

4. Country of Women in Southeast Asia

Still farther to the southeast is a country of women. Here, the water constantly flows east, and once
overflows, or flows out.

This country has lotus seeds over 1 foot long and peach stones two feet long. The people who get them present them to the queen.

In the olden days, whenever a ship was wrecked by a typhoon there, the women would take the men home with them. But they were all dead within a few days. A cunning fellow stole a boat at night and fled and told the story. 

The women of this country conceive by exposing themselves naked to the full force of the south wind and give birth to female children. 


4b. Country of Women in the Indian Ocean

In the Western Sea, there is also a country of women governed by a queen where only 3 females go to every 5 males. 

All civil offices are in the hands of women. Men handle all the military duties. 

Noble women have several male servants. But the men may not have female attendants. 

Children get their name from the mother. The climate is usually cold. Hunting with bow and arrows is their main occupation. 

They barter with the Iraqis and  with Ta-ts*in and T'ien-chu and make several hundred percent in profits.

they bring it up; and if any man visit their island, whenever they are able to kill him, they do so».1
