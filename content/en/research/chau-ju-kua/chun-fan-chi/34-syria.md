Lumei, also called Meiluku, is 300 stages west by land from Aden (Malopa). 

The city wall is crooked, seven-fold, and built of large smooth flat black stones. Each wall is 1,000 paces from the adjoining one.  There are over 300 minarets. One of which is 800 feet tall which allows 4 horses abreast to pass through.

It has 360 rooms in made of coloured woollen stuffs

30 is nothing in the Chinese name or in the description of the place to help us to elucidate the
question. One is inclined to look for it in Kuniyah (Iconinm, Konieh) which was the capital of
the Seljuk Sultanate of Eum from 1077 to 1257, when it was captured by the Mongols. See
