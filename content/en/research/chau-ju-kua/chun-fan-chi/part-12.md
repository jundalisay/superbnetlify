## 12. SANDALWOOD

Tan-hiang comes from Takang and Tiwu, as well as Palembang, Sumatra. 

The tree, even its leaves, resembles the Chinese lichee. 

The natives fell the tree and dry it in the shade. Its aroma is pure and strong and apt to evaporate; in burning

Schlegel has suggested (see supra, p. 86) that Ta-kang is

In the first part of his work
our author has told us that sandal-wood was also a product of
T'i6n-chu (western coast of India),
10 and of the Malay Peninsula, and that Ts'ong-pa (Zanguebar) produced yellow
sandal-wood.

latter point, see supra, p. 127, n. 4.

519, says, regarding sandal-wood, that «from Java
and Madura eastward it is scattered in small quantities throughout the different islands, improving
in quality and quantity as we move to the east, until we reach Timur, where the best and
largest
supply occurs. In the language of Timur sandal-wood is called Aikameml, and in that of
20 Amboyna Ayasru. In the western countries, where it either does not exist at all, or exists in
small quantities and of bad quality, it is universally known by the Sanskrit name Chandana.n In
another passage (III, 421) he says «the sandal-wood of the Indian Islands is considered inferior
to that of
Malabar. -->


13. CLOVES

Ting-hiang or nail-incense comes from Arabia and Java. These resemble the shape of the Chinese character ting, a nail. 

It can remove bad smells from the mouth. High officials at court put it in their mouths when they have to say things to the Emperor. 

The large ones are called ting-hiang-mu. This is the same as ki-sho-hiang, though some say that ki-sho-hiang is the stone of the Persian date.

dependencies, the same region which produced sandal-wood, in
other words the Moluccas. He refers also to the trade in cloves in Ceylon and in Malabar, whither
they were brought by foreign traders (Fan-sJiang). Our author was, therefore, better informed
on this subject than Marco Polo who, though stating in one passage (II, 254) that they were a
of Java, adds in another (II, 289) that they grew also on the island of Necuveran (Nico-
bar Islands). Ibn Batuta, Voyages, IV, 243, confounded the cinnamon and the nutmeg-tree
