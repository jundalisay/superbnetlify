## 19. Coconuts

The ye-tsi, as regards the trunk and leaves, closely resembles the coir-palm and areca-palm. 

The fruit grows in the leaves in bunches of several nuts of the size of a 5-pint vessel. It is the biggest of fruits, with the sole exception of the jack-fruit.

When cut, the outer skin is at first green and tender. But after some time, it turns yellow. When kept a long time, the skin shrivels and dries up.

The nut shell contained in the outer skin can be made into vessels. The pulp inside the shell is of a jade-like white, and of an agreeable taste, resembling that of cow's milk.

The juice inside the pulp is very clear and fragrant when fresh, but when stale it turns muddy and no longer drinkable. In the states of Nanpi, they make wine out of the juice of its flower mixed with syrup.

The explanation of this wood being designated by the same term in old Chinese works
and by the Persians must be that, either the Chinese received their first supplies of it through
Persian traders, or the word is indigenous to one of the Indo-Chinese districts where the
tree grows, and that it had travelled to the east and west with the article. This last
