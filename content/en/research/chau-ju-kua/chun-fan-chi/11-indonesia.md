The kingdom of Sunda (Sinto) has a harbor with a depth of 60 feet. 

The people are given to agriculture. They live along the shores wit houses made of poles stuck in the ground, roofed over with the bark of the coir-palm. The partitions are made with wooden boards tied with rattan. 

Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton. They cut their hair, leaving it only half an inch long.

The country produces:
- pepper
- pumpkins
- sugar-cane
- bottle-gourds
- beans and egg-plants

Its pepper are small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of Tapan (Eastern Java). 

It has no regular government. This causes people to be criminals. This is why foreign traders rarely go there.

and there seems
no doubt that the western portion of the island of Java is meant; it would even appear that
Sin-t'o must have extended well to the E. of Java, for our author has told us previously that
San-fo-ts'i extended as far E. as Jung-ya-lu in the present district of Surabaya, although it is
10 difficult to reconcile this with our author's remark that Sukitan
was con-

speaks of the «pepe molto eccellenti» of Sunda.
The people of Sunda resisted for a long time the power of the Javanese, and were only
reduced by Kaden Panka, who ascended the throne in 1156 and transferred his capital to
20 Pajajaran in the west of the island for the purpose of subduing and keeping under control the
people of Sunda. This prince is reported to have introduced rice culture into Sunda. See Lassen,

Indische Alterthumsk. IV, 476. It seems likely that the absence of any regular government, to
which our author refers, may have been a result of the war going on at the time to which this
notice of Sunda relates, some fifty years earlier than the time at which C h a u wrote. It also explains
25 the absence of any mention of rice among the native products of this part of Java. Crawfurd,
however (op. cit. I, 358). considers rice «an indigenous product in the Archipelago and its culture
and that one improved tribe taught and disseminated that art».

## 12. Lamuri Eastern Sumatra

Lamuri (Kienpi) is at the the mouth of the road and is resorted to by trading ships as an anchorage. It can be reached from Palembang in half a month's sailing. 

It was a dependency of Palembang before. But after a fight, it set up its own king. 

It exports:
- tin
- elephants' tusks
- pearls

The people are fond of archery and boast of the number of people that they have killed.

5 days journey from there is Sri Lanka.
