The people are warlike and often use poisoned arrows.

With a north wind one comes within 20 days of Ceylon which under the Chalukya (Nanpi).

Sailing from Ceylon, one arrives at Silan by seeing a continual flashing of lightning.

The King of Ceylon is black. His hair is unkempt and head uncovered. 
- He only wears a cotton cloth of different colours wrapped around him
- He wears sandals of red leather, tied with golden strings.
- He rides an elephant or is carried in a litter

All day, he chews a paste of betel nut and pearl ashes.

His palace is ornamented with cat's-eyes, blue and red precious stones, cornelians, and other jewels. 

The very floor
he walks upon
is

There is an eastern and western palace
- Each has a golden tree, the trunk and branches are made of gold. 
- The flowers, fruit, and leaves are cat's-eyes, blue and red precious stones and such like jewels.
- At the foot of these trees are golden thrones with opaque glass screens.


When the king holds court, his court uses the eastern palace in the forenoon and the western in the afternoon. 

When (the king) is seated, the jewels flashing in the sunshine, the glass (screens) and the jewel-tree shining on each other, make it like the glory of the rising sun.

Two attendants are always present holding a golden dish to receive the remains of the betel nut (paste) chewed by the king. 

The king's attendants pay a monthly fee of 20 taels of gold into the government treasury for the privilege of getting the betel nut (paste)
remains, for it contains plum flower, camphor, and other precious substances. 

The king holds in his hand a jewel of five inches in diameter, which cannot be burnt by fire. 
- It shines at night like a torch
- The king rubs his face with it daily
- He still retains his youthful looks even if he is past 90 years old


The people are very dark-skinned.
- They wrap a sarong around their bodies.
- They go bare-headed and barefooted. 
- They use their hands in eating food.
- Their household utensils are of copper.

Ceylon has a mountain called Siluntie. On the top, there is a huge imprint of a man's foot, over 7 feet long, and a like imprint is visible in the water (of the sea) within over 300 li from the mountain. All the forest trees on the mountain, bend towards it (as if reverencing it).

- cat's-eyes
- red transparent glass

- gold
- silver
- porcelain- ware

So far as
is
known,
Ch6u
K'O-fei was the
first
Chinese writer to mention this section of
30 Sumatra, which he calls (3,2j Lan-li (^S J^)i ""i* concerning which he only says that it took
a merchant junk from Canton forty days to reach it. Ch6u's transcription reproduces very closely
the name used by the Arab travellers of the ninth and subsequent centuries to designate Sumatra
Al-Ramni. As used, however, by Ch6u K'u-fei, our author and by Marco Polo (who writes the
name Lamori), it designates the northern portion of the W. coast of Sumatra, commencing from
35 the neighbourhood of A chin Head. Yule, Marco Polo, 11,281, 283. See also Cordier, Friar

K'u-feii appears to have been the first Chinese writer to speak of Ceylon as Si-lan,
would seem, he must have heard of from a Singhalese who probably shortened the sound
Sihalam (the Pali form for Singhala) into Silam. See Yule, Marco Polo, II, 296, n. 1. The Yuan-
shi, 97, uses the form Ki-Ian

Malabars invasion of Ceylon began in A. D. 515 and ended in 1153, when Prakrama Bahu, having
driven them out of Ceylon, was crowned «soIe king of Lanka». He carried the war into the Dekkan,
and reduced Pandya and Chola, making their sovereigns his tributaries. He carried his arms into
Kamboja and Arramana in the Malay Peninsula (probably between Arracan and Siam). He died 25
in 1155, after the most glorious reign in the annals of Ceylon. aWithin thirty years itom the
decease of Prakrama Bahu, the kingdom was reduced to such an extremity of weakness by con-
tentions amongst the royal family, and by the excesses of their partisans, that the vigilant Malabars

«The lightnings of Ceylon are so remarkable, that in the middle ages they were as
well known to the Arabian seamen, who coasted the island on their way to China, as in later
times the storms that infested the Cape of Good Hope were familiar to early navigators of
Portugal. In the Mohit of Sidi Ali Chelebi, translated by von Hammer, it is stated that to 40
seamen, sailing from Diu to Malacca, «the sign of Ceylon being near is continual lightning, be it
accompanied by rain or without rain; so that 'the lightning of Ceylon' is proverbial for a liar»
