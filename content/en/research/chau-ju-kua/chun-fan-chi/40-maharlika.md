### Manila 麻逸

The country of Maharlika* (Ma-i) is north of Borneo. Its capital has over 1,000 families settled together along both banks of a creek [Pasig River]. 

> *Superphysics note: Ma-i is a shortcut for May-nila which means "having blue". Nila is Sanskrit for blue. The color blue represents the caste of free citizens called Maharlika based on the precolonial caste system. It is improper to call the people of the Philippines as "Manilans" just as we do not call all the French as "Paris-ians". Instead, we call it France as a reference to the Frankish people. We extend this to the Philippines to call the country as Maharlikans as a reference to the majority caste. This is supported by the Chinese characters for Ma-i 麻逸 where 逸 signifies moving freely. 


<!-- </p><p>We apply the Maharlikan caste system as progressive taxation where the datus (ruling class and high net worth people) are taxed more and the maharlika (free citizens). The aliping namamahay (servants and low-class workers) and aliping sagigilid (criminals, vagrants) are not taxed. The description by Chau-ju-kua also explains why federalism is the natural system for Maharlika and also for Indonesia. The unitary system can work with the Arab nations since Islam and the Persian system already has been in force for a long time.</p><p>The caste system manifests in modern countries as the rich caste versus the poor caste. We explain the current caste system in the Philippines at the bottom</p> -->



The Maharlikans cover themselves with a sheet of cotton cloth or hide the lower part of the body with a sarong. There are bronze images of gods of unknown origin, scattered about in the grassy wilderness.

Pirates seldom come to this country.

When trading ships enter the bay, they stop in front of the officials' place which is the place for bartering.  After a ship has been boarded, the natives mix freely with the ship's crew. 

The chiefs are fond of white umbrellas. This is why the traders offer them as gifts.

The Maharlikan traders assemble in crowds and carry the goods away with them in baskets. Even if the foreign merchants do not know the Maharlikan traders and cannot distinguish them, there will be no loss.   <!--  if one initially does not know them, and can but slowly distinguish the men who
there will yet be no loss. --> 
- The native traders will bring those goods to other islands for barter. It will take 8-9 months for them to return.
- They then repay the foreign merchants with what they had obtained for the goods.
- Some, however, do not return within the proper time*. This delay is why vessels trading with Maharlika are the last to return home.

> *Superphysics note: Here, Filipino time is consistent with Maharlikan time. This is why "truth" (katotohanan) is the first constitutional virtue suggested


The following places belong to Maharlika:

- Visayas
- Babuyan (Paipuyen) 
- Mindanao (Pulilu)
- Luzon
- Butuan (Likintung)
- Bulacan (Lihan)


#### Maharlikan Exports

![Beeswax](https://www.buzzaboutbees.net/images/sticks-of-natural-beeswax.jpg)

Their exports are:

- yellow wax
- cotton
- pearls
- tortoise-shell
- medicinal betel-nuts*
- yuta cloth

> *Superphysics note: This is clear proof of the influence of the babaylans which were the feminine priest caste that also concocted herbal medicine. It shows that the Babaylan caste had export potential which contributed to Maharlika's GDP. This is why Maharlikanism advocates the advancement of Maharlikan herbal medicines to catch up with Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine



#### Maharlikan Imports

Foreign merchants barter for these with:

- porcelain
- trade-gold
- iron censers
- lead
- coloured glass beads
- iron needles*

> *Superphysics note: This is consistent with the observation of Pigafetta and Jagor that Maharlikan manufacturing was very weak. This is why Talino is also an important constitutional virtue


<!-- Notes.

1) According to Blumentritt, Versuch einer Ethnographie der Philippinen, 65. Mait,
meaning othe country of the Blacks», was tte name of the island of Mindoro. See B. Laufcr,
252. Considering that our author says
Relations of the Chinese to the Philippine Islands, 251
that the Babuyan islands off the N. coast of Luzon, and Polillo island off the E. coast are a part
of Ma-i, it seems fair to assume that the latter name is used by him as applying to Mindoro and 25
Luzon at all events, if not to the whole Philippine group.
The name of Ma-i was first heard of in China in A. D. 982 when some traders from that
country brought valuable merchandise to Canton. Hervey St. Denis, Ethnographie, II, 502.

The Visayas* (Sansu or Three Islands) belong to Maharlika:

- Panay-Cebu (Kiamayen) 
- Palawan 
- Leyte-Samar (Pakinung)

> *Superphysics Note: This proves that Visayas and Sri Vijaya do not mean 'victory'. Instead, vija means 3 or tiga. In this way, Visayas means 3 islands just as Sri Vijaya (Sanfotsi) means 3 nations as Sumatran, Malay, and Southern Thai

Their local customs are about the same as those of Maharlika. Each tribe has around 1,000 families. The lands have many lofty ridges and ranges of cliffs rise as steep as the walls of a house.

The Visayans build wattled huts perched in lofty and dangerous spots. Since the hills have no springs, the women carry on their heads two or three jars one above the other to fetch water from the streams. They climb the hills with such burdens as if they were walking on level ground.

In the remotest valleys, there lives another tribe called Aetas (Hai-tan) who are small, with round brown eyes and curly hair. They nest in tree tops. Sometimes, parties of three or five lurk in the jungle, and  shoot arrows on passers-by without being seen. Many have fallen victims to them. If thrown a porcelain bowl, they will stoop and pick and go away leaping and shouting for joy.

![Aeta archer](https://aetaarchery.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/aeta-archer-2.jpg)



#### Visayan Exports

Foreign traders arrive by announcing their presence by beating drums then moor their ships midstream. The Visayans race to the ship in small boats, carrying the following for barter:

- cotton
- yellow wax
- native cloth
- coconut-heart mats

If the prices of goods cannot be agreed upon, the chief of the local traders must go in person, in order to come to an understanding. 

The natives are then offered gifts of:
- silk umbrellas
- porcelain
- rattan baskets

The foreign merchants hold one or two natives as hostages on board while they go on shore to trade. They return those hostages after trading is finished.

A ship will only anchor for 3-4 days and then move to another place. The Visayan settlements are along the coast are not connected by common jurisdiction. They are are all independent. 

The coast faces south-west. During the south-west monsoon, ships are unable to anchor there. This is why the traders to the Visayas do the return trip in May or June. 

#### Visayan Imports

The following are exchanged in barter:

- porcelain
- black damask
- various other silks
- beads of all colors
- leaden sinkers for nets
- tin 


### Mindanao

Mindanao (Pulilu) is connected with the Visayas, but its settlements are more populous. Most of the people are of a cruel disposition and given to robbery*. 

> *Superphysics Note= This manifests as the 'rido' clan-war culture and piracy in Sulu. A suggestion to soften such a culture is to overwhelm them with effeminate KPop


The sea thereabout is full of bare ribs of rock with jagged teeth like blasted trees, their points and edges sharper than swords and lances. When ships pass, they tack out in time in order to steer clear of them.

From here come coral-trees, the tsinglangkan, and the shanhu varieties. But they are very difficult to get. 

Their local customs and commercial usages are the same as the Visayas.


<!-- Notes.
Kia-ma-yen is probably CalamiAn, the largest pf the Calamianes group of islands, N. E.
of Palawan; Pa-lau-yu may be Palawan, and Pa-ki-nung, it would seem, should be Busuanga Island.
Laufer, op. sup. cit., 252, note 1, identifies Pa-lau-yu with Penon de Cor6n, near the E. end of
Busuanga, and famous as one of the places where edible bird's nests are gathered.
