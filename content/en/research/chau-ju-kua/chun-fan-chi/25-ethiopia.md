Yemen is on the sea-coast and a land road leads to the Arabs. 

The king has a dark brown complexion and wears a turban and a jacket. He is a Muslim and follows the Arab life.

## 27. Somali (Chungli)

The Somalis go bareheaded and barefooted. They wrap themselves in cotton stuffs. 

Only the ministers and king's courtiers wear jackets. 

The king lives in a brick house covered with glazed tiles. The people live in huts made of palm leaves and covered with grass-thatched roofs. 

Their eat baked flour cakes, sheep's and
camel's milk. They have many cattle, sheep and camels. 

This is the only Arab country that makes frankincense.

There have many sorcerers who change themselves into birds, beasts, or aquatic animals to terrorize the ignorant people. 

If some of them in trading with some foreign ship have a quarrel, the sorcerers pronounce a charm over the ship, so that it can neither go forward nor backward, and they only release the ship when it has settled the dispute. 

The government has formally forbidden this
practice.

Every year, countless numbers of birds of passage alight in the desert parts of this country.

When the sun rises, they suddenly disappear. The people catch them with nets and eat them. They are remarkably savoury. 

They are in season till the end of spring,
summer comes, they

When a Somali diesdies, and they are about to bury him in his coffin, his kinsfolk from near and far to condole. Each person has a sword in his hand, goes in and asks the mourners the cause of the person's death. If he was killed by the hand of man, each one says, we revenge him on the murderer with these swords. 

Should the mourners reply that he was not killed by any one, but that he came to his end by the
