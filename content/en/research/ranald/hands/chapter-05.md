MOUNT JUPITER
The mount of Jupiter, underneath the first finger, indicates pride
and ambition, the desire to dominate others. When mount Jupiter is
well developed and the finger of Jupiter is dominant, you will find
pride swollen into vanity and bluster.38
ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
The Jupiterian one in whom the finger of Jupiter is dominant
and the mount highly developed is frequently religious and derives
great comfort from the pageantry and show of church worship. You
will often find
high dignitaries of the church among the children of
Jupiter.
Of course, the qualities of leadership which go with a strong finger
of Jupiter can also find their expression in other fields. For example,

THE THREE MOUNTS OF MARS
The mount of Mars is the most difficult of all to study, for it is
made up of three sections: Mars positive under Jupiter, above the
mount of Venus; Mars negative under Mercury, above the mount
of Luna; and the plain of Mars in the center of the palm (see plate
25). Each of these divisions has its own significance, though the
characteristics of Mars as a whole are courage and aggressiveness.
Mars positive, near the thumb, is the most pugnacious, spirited
and adventurer,
