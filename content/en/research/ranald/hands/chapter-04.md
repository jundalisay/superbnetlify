THE palm itself, its shape and consistency, aside from the markings upon it, tells much about the person whose hand you are studying.
Development of the hand, which is the instrument of the brain, is dependent on all the biological and chemical factors which also de-
termine the personality. Studies of the ductless glands have given us some understanding of the complicated chemistry governing human
energy, sex, and nervous reactions, from the simplest reflex to involved inhibitions and neuroses.

This same machinery of nerve communication and glandular secretions, which decides the weight, height and nervous and muscular responses of the individual, also determines the development of the

the hand as a whole.
The right hand is the one to study in a right-handed person. That
hand gives us a picture of the human being as he is. The left hand
tells us what he might have been
whether for better or worse. What
the left hand pictures is a person's inheritance, the weaknesses, the
strength, the talents and the lacks with which he was born. From
the left hand we are able to judge a person's potentialities. From the
right what he has created out of his potentialities. In a left-handed
person, the significance of the two hands is of course reversed.
This sort of knowledge is a weapon, and with knowledge of our
weaknesses we may be able to overcome them. Here is one very great
value in the message of the left hand. By pointing out the pitfalls
into which we are likely to fall, it helps us to avoid them.
In the right hand we see how far we have developed or dissipated
our inherent endowments. Frequently you will find the two hands
very different from each other. Sometimes, especially in hands with
weak thumbs, you

just as often true. Failure to make use of natural gifts, wasted energy,

line of destiny.
In any case, the message of the operative hand is never a static
one. Comparison of the two hands tells us where we have gone astray
from the path which would have been best for us, and it is thus pos-
sible to correct
our mistake.
Of
course, in a lefthanded person, the readings have to be reversed.
Just what the cause of lefthandedness or ambidexterity is we do not
know. It is, however, a recognized fact that the tendency to use one
hand rather than the other
is
closely associated with the balance of
the central nervous system. Changing the balance by forcing a nat-
urally lefthanded person to use his right is likely to have disastrous
results.
Many
speech defects are laid to interference with the natural
dominance of one hand or the other.
In children especially, nervous maladjustment, extreme shyness
and slow perception result from trying to make them use the right
hand when the left is the naturally operative. Formerly schools and
parents tried to make left-handed youngsters learn penmanship and
other manual arts with the right hand. Nowadays advanced educa-MOUNTS OF THE HAND

have learned that difficult behavior problems, secretiveness, lying,
even stealing, result from such interference with nature's intentions.
Parents and teachers should be especially careful about trying to
