THE STAR
The

with only two exceptions, one of the
most fortunate signs to have. One negative implication is connected
with a star on the line of head, particularly at its end (see plate 56,

THE TRIPOD
A
fork with two short even branches, like the base of a photog-
rapher's tripod seen sectionally (see plate 55) shows dramatic talent.
I have found a formation of this shape on the lines of head, on the
destiny line, on the Apollo line, or even on the line of heart of some
of those who have made their mark behind the world's footlights or
under the Kleigs. This
is
called a tripod.SPECIAL MARKINGS IN THE PALM

THE SQUARE
A square (see plate 55) is always a sign of healing. When it binds
a broken line together, it shows the overcoming of whatever originally
caused the break. The square must be considered in relation to the
position in which it appears. On a mount, it means protection from
the negative connotations of that mount. On a line, it means preserva-
tion from ill health, from excesses, from poor choice in the selection
of your career, protection
from bad judgment
in a love affair, or in
business.
