in the course of true love. In its
path across the hand, the line of
heart may give off many small branches or splits. Splits rising from
the heart line towards any one of the mounts show the attraction of
the mount's characteristics over the affections of the subject. For ex-
ample, a person with many little hairlines rising from the line of
heart toward the mount of Apollo will be much attracted by someone
whom the artistic sensibility and gaiety of the Apollonian pre-
dominate. Lines falling from the line of heart towards the line of

naturally affectionate person may, because of uncongenial surround-

flower out into sympathetic warmth on receiving understanding.

A
termination of the line of heart directed upwards towards any
mounts shows unusually strong influence and attraction from
persons having the attributes of those mounts. A downward bend at
the end of the line of heart gives the affections dominion over rea-

(see plate 43), you may look for serious mental disturbance as a

result of emotional instability.
Sometimes you find only one line in a hand instead of two sep-
arate lines, one governing the head and one the heart. Even when this
line is placed high in the hand, in the normal position for the line of
