When Professor G. Elliot Smith identified the few fragments of all that remains of the Peking Man as definitely those
bone which are human being, and not of an ape, he based his classification on the hand, especially the thumb. More than any other member, the thumb marks man as different from the beasts. 

If you want of a very early what distinguishes the leader, the creator, the successful
man from his fellows, likely as not, you will find that
secret in his thumb.

Notice how short and rigid are the thumbs on plate 17, showing handprints made by an anthropoid ape. In the hand of man, the
thumb is opposable, that is, it can swing in an arc and touch every one of the other fingers. An ape's thumb cannot. Our manual dexterity, the secret of

usually tell what use we put our gifts to. A large thumb strengthens
the qualities of weak fingers, deficient in energy and practicality. It
also emphasizes those qualities in a hand already having energy and
will, perhaps to an extent which may be brutalizing. A large thumb

Conic or pointed fingertips with a small thumb show artistic feel-
ing but no creative power. Add a large thumb to such fingers, and you
are likely to have a poet or artist. Large thumbs increase the power
and energy of spatulate tips and give direction and purpose to square
hands. Small thumbs always detract from the positive qualities of a
hand, not so

hand, should reach to about the middle of the index finger's base
phalanx (see plate 18), and its second and third phalanx should be
of equal size.

plate 19), it is able to move in a wide, sweeping arc, indicating a
generous, liberty-loving, independent and sympathetic person. When
the thumb is high-set (see plate 20), especially if it is held close to

can expect meanness and suspicion; but if the other aspects of the
hand are good, the close setting may indicate only lack of self-
confidence, shyness and oversensitiveness. This is particularly so in
persons who normally hide their thumbs in the half-closed palm. A

square tip gives us a very unimaginative, stubborn
person, a fanatic in his own narrow way.
When the will-phalanx is too short in proportion to the rest of the
thumb, we can expect weak will, a person easily influenced by others
and falling for every temptation. A pointed or tapering end on a
short will-phalanx indicates almost hopeless weakness.

tip on a short will-phalanx diminishes the weakness.
THE PHALANX OF REASON
The second thumb phalanx
(see plate 14,
TH-B)
governs per-
ception, judgment and reasoning powers. If long, it gives the ability
to plan to make decisions, to use sound judgment. When a long sec-
ond phalanx is combined with a short will-phalanx, you find a person
who can make intricate plans but falls short in their execution. On
the other hand, a deficient phalanx of reason with strong will, leads
to action which may often be foolish or misapplied. Waisted forma-THUMB

well-balanced control, an affectionate disposition, and a sense of fair-

lence, the club-shaped thumb has been called the "murderer's thumb,"
though of course it does not actually indicate a murderer. In fact,
the violent characteristics linked to it may be completely submerged
and never given
expression.
