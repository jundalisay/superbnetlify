IN THE LINES OF THE PALM 

the superstitious, fortune-telling uses of palmistry, the lines of
hand are regarded as a sort of key to the future, the various di-
rections and signs being given somewhat arbitrary significance. This
the
point of view I have entirely discarded. I have found no basis at all
in my studies of thousands of hands for the declaration that given
signs definitely foretell events in the lives of men and women.
What
I have found is that the human hand, connected to the brain
thousands
of sensory and motor nerves, registers on its surface a
by
kind of summary of all the messages which pass through the brain.
Thus, the hand gives us an index to the personality.

directed towards a particular mount, it means that the subject is in-

line often throws an interesting light on the main tendencies, telling
about anything from a moment's diversion to a serious change in
variability. Fine lines are often seen branching out

ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
TIME AND AGE IN THE HAND
Using the main lines of the hand as guidemarks, we are able to
compute time and age on the hand. Thus the approximate date asso-
ciated with breaks, periods of restlessness and dissatisfaction, shiftsLINE OF LIFE

can all be calculated from the hand. The only date
which does not show is that which gives the subject's age.
in occupation,
The method
of approximating dates in the hand is simple. Divide
length possible for the line of life, the headline, the
heartline and the line of destiny each into periods of seven as shown
in plate 29. This is a very natural division since important physical
changes in human beings are supposed to occur within cycles of
the
maximum
seven years. Other markings on the hand can be related to this
scheme by drawing radial lines from mount Venus through the seven
divisions on the line of life and extending those imaginary radial
lines to

course, markings which are fixed in their place will have their

riage lines are figured within the confines of the space which they
occupy, not in accordance with the plan of the whole hand, but this

themselves.
