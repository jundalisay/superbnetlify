Only recently has the western world has adopted fingerprinting to aid:
- its police work and
- in keeping track of records embracing large numbers of persons. 

The master criminal identification file which the Federal government has built up in Washington contains what is probably the largest collection of fingerprints in the world, each classified according to type, and no two
exactly alike.

This is the basis of the fingerprint identification system that there are no two sets of fingerprints in the world which are exactly
alike and further that each record is a permanent one. 

Though the hands change in the shape even of their bony structure, though the strong, muscular hand of a youth will become flabby and corded with

Other objections can also be raised, not to the use of fingerprints

The benefits to be derived from fingerprint records of everyone are
immense. Hospitals have been known to mix babies at their birth.
The instances of such confusion are rare, but think of the anguish
of even one pair of parents who will never be certain if the child
they have is really their own. Law cases, claims on inheritances,
various impostures have resulted. Handprinting at birth would com-
pletely eliminate such unsolvable riddles of identity, for with the
print record of a new-born child could be taken an impression from the
mother's hand.

Many institutions have come to
realize the value of finger
and
handprints. Maternity hospitals, finding that the tiny ridges on a
baby's fingertips are too minute to make clear impressions, take
prints of the foot. Footprints, however, do change more or less dur-
ing the course of a lifetime. Because of this, Dr. Gilbert Palmer Pond
has evolved a means which provides identification for life, using
prints of an infant's palm. The ridging on the eminences of the palm
usually coarser than that on baby's fingertips, and such hospital
impressions supply a means of identification which can be used for

could be used to restore them again to their families?
I recall one instance, which recently came to my attention, of
an elderly woman who was led out of a large New York department
store at closing time. She appeared to be a person of culture and
refinement, accustomed to care and thoughtfulness from others. A
victim of amnesia, she had forgotten what brought her to the store,
who she was or where she came from. Institutions gave her their
comfortless hospitality while her frantic family in another city

and even to hired private detectives. They spent terrifying hours
examining unidentified bodies in morgues and studying photographs
of other old women, picked up without name or associations. Only

her family together again. Think of the suffering which might have

and hospitals all over the country.

And
these amazing figures apply to a city where everyone
is re-
quired to register and carry papers of identification. In this country,
the numbers are even more astounding. The New York City Missing
Persons Bureau is now burdened with over thirty thousand identifi-
cation cases each year. Eight thousand dead are buried every year in

tutions.
