THOUGH the line of Apollo (see plate 27, number 5) is accounted
one of the major lines of the hand, it is not present in every hand,
nor even in the majority. Yet, without it, the hand is a poor thing,
promising hardship and struggle without assurance of success. The

These are the unfortunate signs on the line of Apollo. The more
desirable ones are a square, a trident (see plate 48) and, above all,
a star. With a star at the termination of the Apollo line, you have
strong assurance of brilliant success. I have found this sign in the
financiers, writers, artists and statesmen, and in every case,

clusions.
A forked ending is not altogether favorable. It shows a diversity
of talents which may, if concentration and determination are lack-
ing, lead to dissipation of your endowments. But when the fork
assumes the shape of a well-marked trident, this is almost as for-
tunate as a star because it indicates wealth and celebrity achieved
through mental efforts. The star is less specific in its promise, but

branches from the line can be regarded much in the same light.
When they take a rising direction, they are favorable, and their
specific application can be deduced from the direction in which they
point. Falling branches and hairlines show the need for greater con-
centration and effort to enjoy the full benefit of a good Apollo line.
