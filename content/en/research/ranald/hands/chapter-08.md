When
there are dots or islands at the termination of a break, the
injury is the more serious. If the break is repaired by a square, or
bridged by a sister line running parallel to the main line and close
by it, the ill effects of whatever is responsible for the break may be
largely discounted. Refer

to plate 28 for
examples of these
variations in a line.
The course
of the line of head is often altered by small rises or
downwards. For example, it may arch upwards under the
middle finger. In that case, the qualities associated with the mount
of Saturn and the Saturn finger

terns. If the rise in the headline occurs
towards the finger of Apollo,
sensibilities, lightness and gaiety of Apollo must be
connected with the line's change in direction. As a rule, small dips
in the line of head are considered signs of depression, rising arches,
signs of good spirits or of an uplifting influence.
The most usual place of origin for the line of head coincides with
the beginning of the line of life (see plate 33), the two lines being

two lines separate, the sooner will self-reliance be manifested.

base of the first finger (see plate 36), the quality of self-reliance is
turned to recklessness. A person with his headline beginning so close
to the finger of Jupiter is too conceited to listen to the counsel of

gambler, thoughtless of consequences, careless of his actions' effect
on others. When this high headline is short, a jealous temperament

Usually the line of head commences at the edge of the hand.
One
exception to this position is found in the line which leaves a slight
margin at the side and commences under the finger of Jupiter (see
plate 37). Strong ambition will motivate the thinking of a person
with this kind of headline. Usually a headline having this origin is
in quality, and there is every probability of fulfilling the ambi-

The course followed
by the line of head and its termination must
be read in conjunction with the origin. A straight, even path (see
plate 33) denotes good mental balance, excellent control, and a mind
which is neither too taken up with fantasy nor too restricted by
small, practical considerations.

a headline descending onto Luna is one which begins outside the line
of life, but not too high on the side of the hand (see plate 35).
The worst
is a headline commencing inside the line of life (see plate
34), for with so little mental balance and self-confidence, there is
always danger that a strongly imaginative person will take refuge
completely in his land of make-believe, becoming the victim of de-
