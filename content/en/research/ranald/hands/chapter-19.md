the possibility of sexual abnormalities. This may take the form of

explored in connection with this type of skin is overactivity of the

of firm, elastic consistency, shows a personality very close to normal

In diagnosing functional ailments, the physician has found that
psychological aspects must play a larger and larger part in his con-
siderations. Suggestion, auto-suggestion and hysteria are often ac-
companied by physiological symptoms which can scarcely be dis-
tinguished from actual disorders. In some cases, one leads to theAND RIDGES

of the more advanced psychoses.
For every maladjustment, there are previous indications, identify-
ing the type of person and the type of mental unbalance to be ex-
pected of him. The wide swings from one extreme to another
characteristic of manic-depressive insanity find their expression in
the hand, and the duality of the schizophrenic is also shown there.
Where the headline itself is of poor quality, feathered, broken or
chained, too vivid an imagination and tendencies to melancholia are
almost predestined to result in unbalance. Therefore, an inferior
headline with a branch swinging sharply down and penetrating
deeply on to the mount of Luna can be taken as corroborating
indication of this type of insanity.
In a hand with a very poor headline, if the mount of Venus is not
and the mount of Saturn is dominant, morbid hallu-

cinations may occur in early life. In such cases, proper therapeutic
measures are able to stabilize the mind, but opposition or attempts
at suppression aggravate the condition.
The various degrees of subnormal mentality are usually coupled
with hands which have no marked abnormalities but rather a gener-
ally subnormal index. The will phalanx of the thumb will be unde-
veloped. Reasoning powers will be lacking. Emotional responses will
be very limited. Aesthetic sensibilities will be of the simplest, though

Intestinal infections show up as irregular breaks in the ridges and
pieces gouged out of their edge, giving the ridges a crenellated out-
line. Non-malignant ulcers are associated with lack of definition in
the ridging of the skin caused by irregular interruptions and a sort of
featheriness in the ridges' outlines.

Perhaps it is in early identification of the dread disease, cancer,
that study of the hand will have its greatest value to medicine.
All authorities are agreed that early diagnosis and treatment in the
first stages are essential. Yet the first symptoms are often so vague
that they are passed over as of no consequence

Authorities find that the hand quite definitely indicates the
predisposition to cancer, and early stages of the disease can readily
be detected. Malignant growth can be identified by the typical
malformation of the palmar ridges. Seen under the microscope, theseTHE DOCTOR LOOKS AT HANDS

In the same way, the hand will show characteristic deviations from
normal surface markings for diabetes, disorders of the genital sys-
tem, kidneys, liver or nerve and circulatory machinery. It is hardly
within the scope of this book to enlarge on these symptoms, nor is
it the place of a layman to theorize too extensively about the nature
and cause
of disease.
