There are a number of minor groovings which your hand may or may not show. Some of these give valuable assistance to the talents and characteristics revealed by the
rest of

your hand. Others are
less
propitious.
THE LINE OF INTUITION
The
line of intuition (see plate 27,
number
8) is a
mixed
blessing.
Its position is along the outer
edge of the palm, running vertically
from the Lunar mount to the mount of Mercury. Its shape is an arc,
approaching the semi-circle, arching out into the palm.
The

line of destiny, instinct will

an aid to the career.
At times this line of
intuition may be very broken up and confused
with a defective line of health. In that case, the exercise of the in-

This line greatly strengthens a weak line of life and adds tremendous
energy to a good one. Its aid is limited to the period during which it
extends, and only when the line of vitality continues for the whole
length of the line of life is its effect felt from birth to death. On the
whole, the line of Mars is an excellent indication, but there is always
the danger that the bounding energy and vitality it gives will lead to

THE RING OF SOLOMON
The ring of Solomon (see plate 27, number 15) is a very unusual
formation, made by an extension of the line of heart which, instead
of rising on the mount of Jupiter, begins as a semicircle curling like
a ring around the base of the Jupiter finger. This sign I have found
associated with a very fastidious, sensitive nature, often possessing

THE BRACELETS
The
bracelets (see plate 27,
number
11) are the rings on the wrist,
denning the lower edge of the palm. They may be absent altogether
or there may be one or two or, at the most, three. These used to be
considered indications of longevity, a term of thirty years being
arbitrarily assigned to each bracelet. In
my
studies of hands, I have
found the bracelets to mean very little, except that the upcurving of
the topmost one into the palm itself is strong indication of sterility.
THE LINES OF TRAVEL
The lines of travel (see plate 27, number 12) are actually not
prophetic marks of future wanderings over the face of the earth, but
rather the indications of a restlessness which may very well find its
expression in voyagings. These lines are found cutting into the palm
from far on the outer edge of the Lunar mount. They run in a
diagonally upward direction.
