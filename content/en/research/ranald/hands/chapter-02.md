Most hands are of the mixed type. Each finger must be considered separately.

In chirology, there are only 4 fingers (see plate 9). The thumb is so important that it is classed by itself. 

The index finger is called the first, or finger of Jupiter.

The middle finger, the second is the finger of Saturn. 

The ring finger, third, is the finger of Apollo.

The little finger, fourth and last, is the finger of Mercury.

These names were adopted in early times. Because palmistry was

For convenience, I am retaining the traditional finger names, though of course I do not connect them any way with the schematic in superstitions of astrology.

## LONG AND SHORT FINGERS

The important things to note are:

1. Whether the fingers as a whole are long (see plate 10) or short (see plate 11) 
2. Which one or two fingers are dominant ones.


Length cannot be judged entirely from the relative size of the fingers and the palm, for a hand may have an unusually long palm with normal fingers, which would make the fingers appear short rather

fingers would be about as long, reaching almost
to the wrist if doubled over. Long ones would reach the wrist or even beyond it, and short ones would end above. This test cannot,
however, actually be made by bending the hand, for the stiffness of the hand and its thickness, almost as much as the fingers' length,

The best method is to judge the distance by eye or actual measurement.

For ideal balance, the thumb should be as long as the fourth and the first as long as the third. Of course, greatness rarely

order. 

Short ones go with impulsiveness, action, speed.

## WIDTH AND CONTOUR OF FINGERS

Thick fingers are the practical, materialistic ones.

When they are very thick, they show love of luxury and a tendency towards self-indulgence. 

Thin fingers may show indulgence of a different kind petulance and worry for thin fingers are exacting and nervous.

As to the contours, smoothness when the joints do not protrude indicates an open, frank, company-loving nature, light-hearted,
talkative and somewhat shallow. Knotty joints go with seriousness,
thought and mental self-sufficiency.

##  FLEXIBILITY

Whether the fingers are flexible or stiff is extremely significant.

Firm fingers show an intense, passionate, violent nature, one which
might accomplish great things individually or as a leader, but which
cannot cooperate with others or work as a subordinate. The draw-
backs of such fingers are intolerance, stubbornness and lack of tact.

The last is especially pronounced when the fingers are short as well
stiff.

With flexibility goes an intensification of the qualities of the
mount and finger. Supple fingers indicate adaptability, tact, wit and
success in social contacts, though not necessarily a love of company.

CROOKED FINGERS

Crooked fingers (see plate 12) show distortion or misuse of the which go with the misshapen finger, but the knotty, bony
structure of the profound hand should not be confused with bent or qualities
crooked shape.

Nor is crookedness the same as a slight bending to one side. 

Fingers bent laterally (see plate 13) always emphasize shrewdness, and this indication should be studied in conjunction
with the particular qualities ascribed to the finger having such a bend.

A finger twisted on its axis exaggerates the moral or physical
defects associated with that finger.

DOMINANT FINGERS

In most persons, the fingers differ greatly in length, smoothness, thickness,etc. from each other.

It is therefore important not only to determine which qualities predominate for the hand as a
whole, but to relate them to the traits which go with each particular

THE PHALANXES

But before considering the fingers individually, I want to discuss
the divisions of the fingers, that is, the three joints or phalanxes.
The nail phalanx is always referred to as the first (see plate 14, the
marked A) the middle division as the second (see plate 14,

the third phalanx leads, I have found the subject greatly absorbed
in the physical side of life.

THE SATURN FINGER
The
second, or Saturn finger as the middle finger is called (see
plate 9), governs thought. When this finger is the dominant one (see

plate 16), towering above its two neighbors, our subject is likely to
be serious and given to solitude. He may have humor, but it is prob-

A very thin middle phalanx in the little finger (see plate 14, 4B)
gives us the gambler, or a very ambitious person who is impatient of
the usual methods of fulfilling his ambitions. A long middle phalanx
indicates a commercial or legal bent. A short middle phalanx shows
loyalty.
