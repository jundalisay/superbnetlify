THE line of destiny or Saturn (see plate 27, number 4), tells:
- the plan of life
- whether that plan will be easily fulfilled or not.

When the destiny line is deep, clear and without interfering cross markings, you may expect a career pursued with determination and leading to success. 

I have found rare hands without this line.
- In such cases, the subject has made his own way in life by his own own ingenuity unassisted by:
  - friends
  - influence or luck

<!-- except as those aids brought into play through the man's . -->
<!-- The strength of a happy augury is much diminished
if
the Saturn -->

A very broad, pale and shallow Saturn line is a bad sign. 
- His talents were wasted and energy applied much too haphazardly to realize the hand's full promise.

A very thin and light line indicates a lack of forcefulness which interferes with success.

Breaks in the line of destiny show some obstacle in the career sufficiently strong to interrupt it. 

If the break is healed over by a square, or carried by a sister line paralleling the broken line of destiny the interruption will be less serious, the obstacle overcome.

Sometimes, the line of destiny takes up an entirely new course after a break, showing that the interference has directed you into new endeavors.

Whether the change is to your benefit is shown by the quality of the line, both before and after the break. 

Should the line be stronger and clearer when it resumes its course, your new career be more promising than the abandoned one.

Frequently, I find the line of destiny cut by either the line of head or the line of heart, sometimes both, with marked breaks occurring at the crossing.

An interference that comes from the line of head, shows that some mistake in judgment has caused his life's work to be interrupted. 

If the line of head actually stops the Saturn line in its ascent (see plate 45), poor judgment has seriously blocked your chances of success. 

Such ill omens are, however, not permanent unless you allow yourself to be discouraged by them.

Fate lines that have thus stopped, begin a new growth as courage returned and the person tried to build another career. 

Sometimes, the new line is of much better quality than the one which ended so ominously.

Interference with the line of Saturn from the line of heart shows emotional unbalance to be the cause of an upset. Here again, as in
the case of hindrance from the line of head, the seriousness of the break must be judged both from the indications of healing which
are present, such as a square or a parallel line, as well as from the
course and strength of the line of Saturn after the break.

The space between the lines of head and heart is frequently the least promising portion of the line of destiny. 

This period is from about 30 to 45 years old, often the most active of one's life. 

The end of the Saturn line here shows whether or not he is able to overcome the vicissitudes and demands of life at that age.

If it becomes stronger after having passed the line of heart, the middle years will enrich your life and make success taste sweeter.

Lines running into the line of Saturn strengthen it, revealing the
source of the strength they bring by their origin and direction.
Though the line of Saturn does not vary much in its termination,
it may begin from a number of places. Its most usual origin is from
the center of the palm near the wrist. This origin is the normal
