does he see just an appendage through which we can express our-
selves, supplementing our powers of speech by gesture.
Underlying the doctor's professional glance at our hands is his
knowledge of their structure and their functioning. First, he sees in
the hand a part of the body whose development he can trace through

became more complicated. Cells of living matter became specialized
in form and function. In the simplest forms, a single cell had limited
and elementary powers of motion and feeling. That single cell com-
bined the functions of eating, reproducing and reacting to outside
stimuli. As the organism grew more complicated, special cells be-
came different from their fellows. Certain ones took on the job of
responding to outside impressions. These were nerve cells. Others
took on the job of producing substances needed by the body. These
were gland cells. Others had the work of contracting, or moving.
These made up the muscle tissue.
The doctor sees all these cells at their work in the hand. Struc-
he sees a skeleton of small bones at the wrist, the carpal

Just as the nerves form a telegraphic coordinating system govern-
ing movement and responses through the body, so do the gland cells
influence the chemistry of the body. The two functions really cannot
be separated, for the health and activity of certain glands, particu-
larly the ductless or endocrine glands, influence the nerve responses.

large amounts of fat. It will cause subnormal body temperature, a
slower pulse, a general slowing of the body's living processes accom-
panied by mental and physical sluggishness. The hand will exhibit
definite symptoms showing this thyroid deficiency. And excess of the
thyroid hormone, which raises the tempo of living, increases the
pulse rate and results in emaciation and nervous irritability, will also
be indicated in the hand.STRUCTURE OF THE HAND

this is so. I have no definite answer to the mystery, except to
suggest that the intimate connection of the hands with the function-
ing of the entire body gives the hands a sort of preview of the things
which make us behave, not only like human beings, but like a par-
ticular human being, Jack Jones, or Jill Smith. Whatever the reason,

have found the hands an unusually accurate guide not only to the
temporary attitude of a person toward life, but also to the more or
less consistent outlook which runs like a main motif through all his
actions. Since, in

diseases, the patient's psychological state is
as important as his physiological, I think a study of the hands will
give extremely valuable aid in their treatment. So long as man's self
is the least understood phenomenon with which he has to deal, he
ought certainly to use every means by which he can know himself
better.
