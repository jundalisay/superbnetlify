SOME time ago, there was an eclipse of the sun which was predicted so many years ago, even before the birth of the scientists who would observe it. 

Was this a case of clairvoyance? Was it a penetration of the future by some gifted seer who was trusted by the scientists?

No. It came from a detailed prediction of the exact path that the moon would take to create the eclipse.

Predictions are also done in other fields of science. 

- Chemists can tell in advance the reaction that will be produced by combining two substances.
- Physicists will explain how soon and where a projectile, shot from a certain place, will hit.
- Engineers will inform you how many revolutions per minute to expect from a wheel as the power applied is increased or decreased.

In less learned circles, everyone is willing to embark on limited predictions about the everyday occurrences of our lives. 
- We take for granted that night will be followed by morning. 
- We assume that when we apply a match to an open gas jet the gas will ignite. 
- We are not surprised when we drop a pencil to see it fall to the ground.

We translate a repeated occurrence into prediction.

The scientist does not go that far. His predictions are based on involved calculations that use of past observations.

He is not so certain as you that the sun will rise tomorrow, for his mathematical formulae express only its probability, not its certainty.

<!-- Theoretically, his statistics give

In practice, however, he is able to figure the exact shift from yesterday's path, both in time and position, by which tomorrow's sunrise will differ from yesterday's.

Thus, the scientist makes predictions daily and has them accepted as valid both by his colleagues and by the general public.

<!-- the betting odds for and against.  -->

As for the psychologist, the study of hands provides him with a
fund of information capable of being dealt with in a thoroughly
scientific manner. Best of all, the hands, in my opinion, are a bridge
by means of which we can join the physician's, biologist's and
physiologist's approach to his subject with that of the psychologist.

To
the anthropologists, the study of hands should be of special
interest. The various races have not only characteristic facial and
cranial variations, but also
marked
differences in their hands.
The
hands of Negroes are long and narrow. The northern white races
have large, broad hands. Mongolians usually have hands medium
to small in size with long, sinewy fingers.
Different nationalities also tend to develop characteristic hands.
The composite which is known as American is developing a hand
rather longer in the fingers than that of the European nations which
migrated here. The American hand has a prominent ridge across the
back.

the Assyrians and Egyptians were devotees of the
Ancient Chinese civilizations thought that hidden meanings and
occult signs could be read in the lines of the hand. Athenian philoso-
phers have left treatises on palmistry, both Plato and Aristotle having
written on the subject. Roman emperors were among its practition-
ers, and from ancient times to this day statesmen, kings, princes and
adventurers have, before important ventures tested their luck by
asking the aid of palmists.
Unfortunately the mystic and occult powers assigned to palmists
almost from the beginning of time prevented study of the hands from
developing into an exact science. That it is capable of being so de-
veloped I am fully convinced. I have tried in this book to approach
the subject from an entirely pragmatic point of view. I have wanted
to strip hand analysis of all its false trappings of mysticism. At best
