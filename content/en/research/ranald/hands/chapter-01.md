One of the few things which modern, scientific hand analysis has retained from ancient palmistry is the classification of human hands by their shapes. 

Various students of the hand have divided their subject into as many as 170 typical divisions. But most authorities agree on 7 basic types, each with its characteristic traits.

THE CONIC HAND
most common types is the conic, or sensitive
name from its cone-like or trian-
gular shape, broad at the base and tapering at the tip. The pure type
is conically shaped both in the palm and in the fingers, each finger
tapering from a wide base to a small tip. The fingertips are rounded,
sometimes slightly pointed.

do not have the energy and force required to create beauty. They
appreciate it. They enjoy it and respond to it intuitively, often with-

without regard for reality, rather than the logic of practicality.
The knotty-handed person delights in the intricacies of higher math-
ematics or metaphysical discussion. Material wellbeing is of no con-
sequence to the owner of this philosophic hand. He is contemptuous
of worldly success and is frequently almost foolhardy in generosity
with his possessions. Yet he can be miserly, though unconsciously

Love of beauty and disgust with ugliness are often guiding prin-

COMBINED TYPES
Of course, there are few persons nowadays whose hands are of one
type alone. Most of us are much more complex than that. There are
various combinations, such as a square hand with exceptionally
long, though still squaretipped fingers (see plate 6). Such a combi-
nation is an excellent one, the long fingers adding an inquiring mind
and keen observation
to
the practical nature which goes with a
purely square hand.

To analyze such a hand, the student must determine what its
dominant forces are. I shall discuss that in the chapter on the
mounts and in the one about the fingers. Aside from what the indi-
vidual fingers tell us, we can consider certain tendencies common to
all
mixed hands.

ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

The mixed hand shows

combined with a
variability of
purpose which often negates the former. People with mixed hands
are facile, resourceful, adaptable. They are restless and inquisitive,
enthusiastic and inventive. But they often fail to develop any one of
their many gifts to its limit and so become jacks of all trades and
masters of none. Of course, the weaknesses in a mixed hand are less-
ened by energy and purpose and magnified if the will is not strong.
In studying a hand, try to classify it according to one of the
seven types. If, as is most often true, you decide that your subject
is of the mixed type, then determine what the dominant traits are.
