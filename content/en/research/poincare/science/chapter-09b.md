Every generalisation supposes in a certain measure a belief in the unity and simplicity of Nature. As far as the unity is concerned, there can be no difficulty. If the different parts of the universe were not as the organs of the same body, they would not react one upon the other; they would mutually ignore each other, and we in particular should only know one part. We need not, therefore, ask if Nature is one, but how she is one.

As for the second point, that is not so clear. It is notcertain that Nature is simple. Can we without danger act as if she were?

There was a time when the simplicity of Mariotte’s law was an argument in favour of its accuracy: when
Fresnel himself, after having said in a conversation with
Laplace that Nature cares naught for analytical difficulties, was compelled to explain his words so as not to
give offence to current opinion. 

Nowadays, ideas have changed considerably; but those who do not believe that natural laws must be simple, are still often obliged to act
as if they did believe it. They cannot entirely dispense with this necessity without making all generalisation, and
therefore all science, impossible. 

Any fact can be generalised in an infinite number of ways, and it is a question of choice. 

The choice can only be guided by considerations of simplicity. Let us take the most
ordinary case, that of interpolation. We draw a con-
tinuous line as regularly as possible between the points
given by observation. Why do we avoid angular points
and inflexions that are too sharp? Why do we not make
our curve describe the most capricious zigzags? It is because we know beforehand, or think we know, that the
law we have to express cannot be so complicated as all that. The mass of Jupiter may be deduced either from
the movements of his satellites, or from the perturbations
of the major planets, or from those of the minor planets.

If we take the mean of the determinations obtained by these three methods, we find three numbers very close
together, but not quite identical. This result might be
interpreted by supposing that the gravitation constant is
not the same in the three cases; the observations would
be certainly much better represented. Why do we reject
this interpretation? Not because it is absurd, but because it is uselessly complicated. We shall only accept it
when we are forced to, and it is not imposed upon us yet.

To sum up, in most cases every law is held to be simple until the contrary is proved.
This custom is imposed upon physicists by the rea-
sons that I have indicated, but how can it be justified
in the presence of discoveries which daily show us fresh
details, richer and more complex? How can we even rec-
oncile it with the unity of nature? For if all things are
interdependent, the relations in which so many different
objects intervene can no longer be simple.
If we study the history of science we see produced twoscience and hypothesis

phenomena which are, so to speak, each the inverse of the
other. Sometimes it is simplicity which is hidden under
what is apparently complex; sometimes, on the contrary,
it is simplicity which is apparent, and which conceals
extremely complex realities. What is there more com-
plicated than the disturbed motions of the planets, and
what more simple than Newton’s law? There, as Fresnel
said, Nature playing with analytical difficulties, only uses
simple means, and creates by their combination I know
not what tangled skein. Here it is the hidden simplicity which must be disentangled. Examples to the con-
trary abound. In the kinetic theory of gases, molecules
of tremendous velocity are discussed, whose paths, deformed by incessant impacts, have the most capricious
shapes, and plough their way through space in every direction. The result observable is Mariotte’s simple law.
Each individual fact was complicated. The law of great numbers has re-established simplicity in the mean. Here
the simplicity is only apparent, and the coarseness of our
senses alone prevents us from seeing the complexity.
Many phenomena obey a law of proportionality. 

But why? Because in these phenomena there is something which is very small. The simple law observed is only the
translation of the general analytical rule by which the infinitely small increment of a function is proportional to
the increment of the variable. As in reality our increments are not infinitely small, but only very small, the
law of proportionality is only approximate, and simplicity is only apparent. What I have just said applies to the
law of the superposition of small movements, which is so
fruitful in its applications and which is the foundation of optics.

And Newton’s law itself? Its simplicity, so long undetected, is perhaps only apparent. Who knows if it be
not due to some complicated mechanism, to the impact of some subtle matter animated by irregular movements,
and if it has not become simple merely through the play of averages and large numbers? In any case, it is difficult
not to suppose that the true law contains complementary terms which may become sensible at small distances. 

If in astronomy they are negligible, and if the law thus regains its simplicity, it is solely on account of the enor-
mous distances of the celestial bodies. No doubt, if our
means of investigation became more and more penetrating, we should discover the simple beneath the complex,
and then the complex from the simple, and then again the simple beneath the complex, and so on, without ever
being able to predict what the last term will be. We mustscience and hypothesis

stop somewhere, and for science to be possible we must
stop where we have found simplicity. That is the only
ground on which we can erect the edifice of our gener-
alisations. But, this simplicity being only apparent, will
the ground be solid enough? That is what we have now
to discover.

For this purpose let us see what part is played in our
generalisations by the belief in simplicity. We have verified a simple law in a considerable number of particular
cases. We refuse to admit that this coincidence, so often repeated, is a result of mere chance, and we conclude
that the law must be true in the general case.

Kepler remarks that the positions of a planet observed by Tycho are all on the same ellipse. Not for one moment
does he think that, by a singular freak of chance, Tycho
had never looked at the heavens except at the very mo-
ment when the path of the planet happened to cut that
ellipse. What does it matter then if the simplicity be
real or if it hide a complex truth? Whether it be due to
the influence of great numbers which reduces individual
differences to a level, or to the greatness or the smallness
of certain quantities which allow of certain terms to be
neglected—in no case is it due to chance. This simplicity,
real or apparent, has always a cause. We shall therefore always be able to reason in the same fashion, and if a
simple law has been observed in several particular cases, we may legitimately suppose that it still will be true in
analogous cases. To refuse to admit this would be to attribute an inadmissible rôle to chance. However, there
is a difference. 

If the simplicity were real and profound it would bear the test of the increasing precision of our
methods of measurement. If, then, we believe Nature to
be profoundly simple, we must conclude that it is an ap-
proximate and not a rigorous simplicity. This is what
was formerly done, but it is what we have no longer the
right to do. 

The simplicity of Kepler’s laws, for instance, is only apparent; but that does not prevent them from
being applied to almost all systems analogous to the solar
system, though that prevents them from being rigorously exact.
