The role of the 2 fundamental principles of thermodynamics becomes daily more important in all branches of natural philosophy. 



The ambitious theories of 40 years ago were encumbered with molecular hypotheses.

We abandon them and we rest the entire edifice of mathematical physics on thermodynamics alone. 

Will the 2 principles of Mayer and of Clausius assure to it foundations solid enough to last for some time? 

We all feel it, but whence does our confidence arise? 

An eminent physicist said to me one day, àpropos of the law of errors:—every one stoutly believes it, because mathematicians imagine that it is an effect of observation, and observers imagine that it is a mathematical theorem.

This was for a long time the case with the principle of the conservation of energy. It is no
longer the same now. There is no one who does not know that it is an experimental fact. 

But then who gives us the right of attributing to the principle itself more generality and more precision than to the experiments which have served to demonstrate it? 

This is asking, if it is legitimate to generalise, as we do every day, empiric data, and I shall not be so foolhardy as to discuss this question,
after so many philosophers have vainly tried to solve it.

One thing alone is certain. If this permission were refused to us, science could not exist; or at least would be
reduced to a kind of inventory, to the ascertaining of isolated facts. 

It would not longer be to us of any value, since it could not satisfy our need of order and harmony, and because it would be at the same time incapable of prediction. 

As the circumstances which have preceded any fact whatever will never again, in all probability, be simultaneously reproduced, we already require a first generalisation to predict whether the fact will be renewed as soon as the least of these circumstances is changed.

But every proposition may be generalised in an infinite number of ways. Among all possible generalisations we must choose, and we cannot but choose the simplest. 

We are therefore led to adopt the same course as if a simple law were, other things being equal, more probable than
a complex law. A century ago it was frankly confessed and proclaimed abroad that Nature loves simplicity; but Nature has proved the contrary since then on more than one occasion. 

We no longer confess this tendency, and we only keep of it what is indispensable, so that science may
not become impossible. 

In formulating a general, simple, and formal law, based on a comparatively small number of not altogether consistent experiments, we have only obeyed a necessity from which the human mind cannot free itself. But there is something more, and that is why I dwell on this topic. 

No one doubts that Mayer’s principle is not called upon to survive all the particular laws
from which it was deduced, in the same way that Newton’s law has survived the laws of Kepler from which it
was derived, and which are no longer anything but approximations, if we take perturbations into account. Now
why does this principle thus occupy a kind of privileged position among physical laws? There are many reasons for that. At the outset we think that we cannot reject it, or even doubt its absolute rigour, without admitting the possibility of perpetual motion; we certainly feel distrust at such a prospect, and we believe ourselves less
rash in affirming it than in denying it. 

That perhaps is not quite accurate. The impossibility of perpetual motion only implies the conservation of energy for reversible phenomena. The imposing simplicity of Mayer’s principle equally contributes to strengthen our faith. 

In a law immediately deduced from experiments, such as Mariotte’s law, this simplicity would rather appear to us a reason for distrust; but here this is no longer the case. 

We take elements which at the first glance are unconnected; these arrange themselves in an unexpected order, and form a harmonious whole. We cannot believe that this unexpected harmony is a mere result of chance. Our conquest appears to be valuable to us in proportion to the efforts it
has cost, and we feel the more certain of having snatched its true secret from Nature in proportion as Nature has
appeared more jealous of our attempts to discover it.

But these are only small reasons. Before we raise Mayer’s law to the dignity of an absolute principle, a deeper discus-
sion is necessary. But if we embark on this discussion we see that this absolute principle is not even easy to enun-
ciate. In every particular case we clearly see what energyscience and hypothesis

is, and we can give it at least a provisory definition; but it is impossible to find a general definition of it. If we
wish to enunciate the principle in all its generality and apply it to the universe, we see it vanish, so to speak,
and nothing is left but this—there is something which remains constant. But has this a meaning? 

In the determinist hypothesis the state of the universe is determined
by an extremely large number n of parameters, which I
shall call x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , , x n . As soon as we know at a
given moment the values of these n parameters, we also
know their derivatives with respect to time, and we can
therefore calculate the values of these same parameters
at an anterior or ulterior moment. In other words, these
n parameters specify n differential equations of the first
order. These equations have n−1 integrals, and therefore
there are n − 1 functions of x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , x n , which re-
main constant. If we say then, there is something which
remains constant, we are only enunciating a tautology.
We would be even embarrassed to decide which among
all our integrals is that which should retain the name of
energy. Besides, it is not in this sense that Mayer’s prin-
ciple is understood when it is applied to a limited system.
We admit, then, that p of our n parameters vary inde-
pendently so that we have only n − p relations, generally linear, between our n parameters and their derivatives.
Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that the sum of the work done by the external forces is zero, as well as that
of all the quantities of heat given off from the interior:
what will then be the meaning of our principle? 

There is a combination of these n − p relations, of which the first member is an exact differential ; and then this differential
vanishing in virtue of our n − p relations, its integral is a constant, and it is this integral which we call energy. But
how can it be that there are several parameters whose variations are independent? That can only take place in
the case of external forces (although we have supposed,
for the sake of simplicity, that the algebraical sum of all
the work done by these forces has vanished). If, in fact,
the system were completely isolated from all external ac-
tion, the values of our n parameters at a given moment
would suffice to determine the state of the system at any
ulterior moment whatever, provided that we still clung to
the determinist hypothesis. We should therefore fall back
on the same difficulty as before. If the future state of the
system is not entirely determined by its present state, it
is because it further depends on the state of bodies ex-
ternal to the system. But then, is it likely that there
exist among the parameters x which define the state ofscience and hypothesis

the system of equations independent of this state of the
external bodies? and if in certain cases we think we can
find them, is it not only because of our ignorance, and
because the influence of these bodies is too weak for our
experiment to be able to detect it? If the system is not
regarded as completely isolated, it is probable that the
rigorously exact expression of its internal energy will de-
pend upon the state of the external bodies. Again, I have
supposed above that the sum of all the external work is
zero, and if we wish to be free from this rather artificial
restriction the enunciation becomes still more difficult.
To formulate Mayer’s principle by giving it an absolute
meaning, we must extend it to the whole universe, and
then we find ourselves face to face with the very diffi-
culty we have endeavoured to avoid. To sum up, and
to use ordinary language, the law of the conservation of
energy can have only one significance, because there is
in it a property common to all possible properties; but
in the determinist hypothesis there is only one possible,
and then the law has no meaning. In the indeterminist
hypothesis, on the other hand, it would have a meaning
even if we wished to regard it in an absolute sense. It
would appear as a limitation imposed on freedom.
But this word warns me that I am wandering from theenergy and thermo-dynamics.

subject, and that I am leaving the domain of mathematics and physics. I check myself, therefore, and I wish to
retain only one impression of the whole of this discussion,
and that is, that Mayer’s law is a form subtle enough for
us to be able to put into it almost anything we like. 

I do not mean by that that it corresponds to no objective
reality, nor that it is reduced to mere tautology; since, in
each particular case, and provided we do not wish to ex-
tend it to the absolute, it has a perfectly clear meaning.
This subtlety is a reason for believing that it will last
long; and as, on the other hand, it will only disappear to
be blended in a higher harmony, we may work with con-
fidence and utilise it, certain beforehand that our work
will not be lost.

Almost everything that I have just said applies to the
principle of Clausius. What distinguishes it is, that it is
expressed by an inequality. It will be said perhaps that it
is the same with all physical laws, since their precision is
always limited by errors of observation. But they at least
claim to be first approximations, and we hope to replace
them little by little by more exact laws. If, on the other
hand, the principle of Clausius reduces to an inequality,
this is not caused by the imperfection of our means of
observation, but by the very nature of the question.science and hypothesis
