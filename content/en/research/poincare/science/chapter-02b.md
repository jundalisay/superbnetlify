##  First Stage

So far it would suffice, in order to account for
facts, to intercalate between A and B a small number of
terms which would remain discrete. 

What happens now if we have recourse to some instrument to make up for
the weakness of our senses? 

If, for example, we use a microscope? 

Such terms as A and B, which before were indistinguishable from one another, appear now to be distinct: but between A and B, which are distinct, is intercalated another new term D, which we can distinguish neither from A nor from B. 

Although we may use the most delicate methods, the rough results of our experiments will always present the characters of the physical continuum with the contradiction which is inherent in it.

We only escape from it by incessantly intercalating new terms between the terms already distinguished, and this operation must be pursued indefinitely. 

We might conceive that it would be possible to stop if we could imagine an instrument powerful enough to decompose the physical continuum into discrete elements, just as the telescope resolves the Milky Way into stars. 

But this we cannot imagine. 

It is always with our senses that we use our instruments; it is with the eye that we observe the image magnified by the microscope, and this image must therefore always retain the characters of visual sensation, and therefore those of the physical continuum.

Nothing distinguishes a length directly observed  from half that length doubled by the microscope. 

The whole is homogeneous to the part; and there is a fresh contradictionâ€”or rather there would be one if the number of the terms were supposed to be finite; it is clear that the part containing less terms than the whole cannot be similar to the whole. 

The contradiction ceases as soon as the number of terms is regarded as infinite. 

There is nothing, for example, to prevent us from regarding the aggregate of integers as similar to the aggregate of even
numbers, which is however only a part of it; in fact, to each integer corresponds another even number which is its double. 

But it is not only to escape this contradiction contained in the empiric data that the mind is led to create the concept of a continuum formed of an indefinite number of terms.

Here everything takes place just as in the series of the integers. We have the faculty of conceiving that a unit
may be added to a collection of units. 

Thanks to experiment, we have had the opportunity of exercising this faculty and are conscious of it; but from this fact we feel
that our power is unlimited, and that we can count indefinitely, although we have never had to count more than a
finite number of objects. 

In the same way, as soon as we have intercalated terms between two consecutive terms of a series, we feel that this operation may be continued without limit, and that, so to speak, there is no intrinsic reason for stopping. 

As an abbreviation, I may give the name of a mathematical continuum of the first order to
every aggregate of terms formed after the same law as
the scale of commensurable numbers. If, then, we intercalate new sets according to the laws of incommensurable
numbers, we obtain what may be called a continuum of
the second order.
