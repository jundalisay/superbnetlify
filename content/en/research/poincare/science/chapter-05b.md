5. But it is not sufficient that the Euclidean (or non-Euclidean) geometry can ever be directly contradicted by
experiment. 

Nor could it happen that it can only agree with experiment by a violation of the principle of sufficient reason, and of that of the relativity of space. 


Consider any material system whatever.

We have to consider on the one hand the “state” of the
various bodies of this system—for example, their temper-
ature, their electric potential, etc.; and on the other hand
their position in space. And among the data which enable
us to define this position we distinguish the mutual dis-
tances of these bodies that define their relative positions,
and the conditions which define the absolute position of
the system and its absolute orientation in space. The law
of the phenomena which will be produced in this system
will depend on the state of these bodies, and on their
mutual distances; but because of the relativity and the
inertia of space, they will not depend on the absolute position and orientation of the system. In other words, the
state of the bodies and their mutual distances at any moment will solely depend on the state of the same bodies
and on their mutual distances at the initial moment, but will in no way depend on the absolute initial position of
the system and of its absolute initial orientation. 

This is what we shall call, for the sake of abbreviation, the law
of relativity.

So far I have spoken as a Euclidean geometer. But I have said that an experiment, whatever it may be, requires an interpretation on the Euclidean hypothesis; it equally requires one on the non-Euclidean hypothesis.
Well, we have made a series of experiments. 

We have interpreted them on the Euclidean hypothesis, and we have recognised that these experiments thus interpreted
do not violate this “law of relativity.” We now interpret them on the non-Euclidean hypothesis. This is always
possible, only the non-Euclidean distances of our different bodies in this new interpretation will not generally
be the same as the Euclidean distances in the primitive interpretation. Will our experiment interpreted in this
new manner be still in agreement with our “law of relativity,” and if this agreement had not taken place, would
we not still have the right to say that experiment has proved the falsity of non-Euclidean geometry? It is easy
to see that this is an idle fear. 

In fact, to apply the law of relativity in all its rigour, it must be applied to the en-
tire universe; for if we were to consider only a part of the
universe, and if the absolute position of this part were
to vary, the distances of the other bodies of the universe
would equally vary; their influence on the part of the
universe considered might therefore increase or dimin-
ish, and this might modify the laws of the phenomena
which take place in it. But if our system is the entireexperiment and geometry.

universe, experiment is powerless to give us any opinion
on its position and its absolute orientation in space. All
that our instruments, however perfect they may be, can
let us know will be the state of the different parts of the
universe, and their mutual distances. 

Hence, our law of relativity may be enunciated as follows:—The readings
that we can make with our instruments at any given mo-
ment will depend only on the readings that we were able
to make on the same instruments at the initial moment.

Now such an enunciation is independent of all interpretation by experiments. If the law is true in the Euclidean
interpretation, it will be also true in the non-Euclidean interpretation. 

Allow me to make a short digression on this point. 

I have spoken above of the data which define the position of the different bodies of the system. I might
also have spoken of those which define their velocities. I
should then have to distinguish the velocity with which
the mutual distances of the different bodies are chang-
ing, and on the other hand the velocities of translation
and rotation of the system; that is to say, the veloci-
ties with which its absolute position and orientation are
changing. For the mind to be fully satisfied, the law of
relativity would have to be enunciated as follows:

The state of bodies and their mutual distances at any given moment, as well as the velocities with which those dis-
tances are changing at that moment, will depend only on the state of those bodies, on their mutual distances
at the initial moment, and on the velocities with which
those distances were changing at the initial moment. But
they will not depend on the absolute initial position of
the system nor on its absolute orientation, nor on the ve-
locities with which that absolute position and orientation
were changing at the initial moment. Unfortunately, the
law thus enunciated does not agree with experiments—at
least, as they are ordinarily interpreted. 

Suppose a man were translated to a planet, the sky of which was con-
stantly covered with a thick curtain of clouds, so that he
could never see the other stars. On that planet he would
live as if it were isolated in space. But he would notice
that it revolves, either by measuring its ellipticity (which
is ordinarily done by means of astronomical observations,
but which could be done by purely geodesic means), or by
repeating the experiment of Foucault’s pendulum. The
absolute rotation of this planet might be clearly shown
in this way. Now, here is a fact which shocks the philoso-
pher, but which the physicist is compelled to accept. We
know that from this fact Newton concluded the existence
of absolute space. I myself cannot accept this way of looking at it. 

I shall explain why in Part 3, but for the moment it is not my intention to discuss this difficulty. I
must therefore resign myself, in the enunciation of the law
of relativity, to including velocities of every kind among
the data which define the state of the bodies. 

However that may be, the difficulty is the same for both Euclid’s geometry and for Lobatschewsky’s. 

I need not therefore trouble about it further, and I have only mentioned it incidentally. 

To sum up, whichever way we look at it, it is impossible to discover in geometric empiricism a rational meaning.
