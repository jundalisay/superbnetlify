Kirchoff has only followed the general tendency of mathematicians towards nominalism. From this, his skill as a physicist has not saved him. 

He wanted a definition of a force. He took the first that came handy. 

But we do not require a definition of force. 

The idea of force is primitive, irreducible, indefinable. We all know what it is. We have a direct intuition of it. 

This direct intuition arises from the idea of effort which is familiar to us from childhood. But still, our direct intuition of force is an insufficient basis for mechanics. It is also quite useless. 

**The important thing is not to know what force is, but how to measure it.** 

Everything which does not teach us how to measure it is as useless to the mechanician as, for instance, the subjective idea of heat and cold to the student of heat.

This subjective idea cannot be translated into numbers,science and hypothesis and is therefore useless; a scientist whose skin is an absolutely bad conductor of heat, and who, therefore, has never felt the sensation of heat or cold, would read a thermometer in just the same way as any one else, and would have enough material to construct the whole of the theory of heat.

Now this immediate notion of effort is of no use to us in the measurement of force. It is clear, for example, that I shall experience more fatigue in lifting a weight of
100 lb. than a man who is accustomed to lifting heavy burdens. 

But there is more than this. This notion of effort does not teach us the nature of force; it is definitively reduced to a recollection of muscular sensations, and no one will maintain that the sun experiences a muscular sensation when it attracts the earth. 

All that we can expect to find from it is a symbol, less precise and less convenient than the arrows (to denote direction) used by geometers, and quite as remote from reality.

Anthropomorphism plays a considerable historic rôle in the genesis of mechanics; perhaps it may yet furnish us with a symbol which some minds may find convenient; but it can be the foundation of nothing of a really scientific or philosophical character.

The Thread School.—M. Andrade, in his Leçons dethe classical mechanics.

Mécanique physique, has modernised anthropomorphic mechanics. To the school of mechanics with which Kirchoff is identified, he opposes a school which is quaintly
called the “Thread School.”

This school tries to reduce everything to the consideration of certain material systems of negligible mass, regarded in a state of tension and capable of transmitting considerable effort to distant bodies—systems of which the ideal type is the fine string, wire, or thread. 

A thread which transmits any force is slightly lengthened in the direction of that force; the direction of the thread tells us the direction of the force, and the magnitude of the force is measured by the lengthening of the thread.

We may imagine such an experiment as the following:

A body `A` is attached to a thread. At the other extremity of the thread acts a force which is made to vary until the length of the thread is increased by α, and the acceleration of the body A is recorded. 

`A` is then detached. A body `B` is attached to the same thread. The same or another force is made to act until the increment of length again is α, and the acceleration of B is noted. 

The experiment is then renewed with both A and B until the increment of length is β.

The 4 accelerations observed should be proportional.science and hypothesis

Here we have an experimental verification of the law of acceleration enunciated above. Again, we may consider a body under the action of several threads in equal tension, and by experiment we determine the direction of those threads when the body is in equilibrium. This is an experimental verification of the law of the composition of forces. 

But, as a matter of fact, what have we done? 

We have defined the force acting on the string by the deformation of the thread, which is reasonable enough; we have then assumed that if a body is attached to this thread, the effort which is transmitted to it by the thread is equal to the action exercised by the body on the thread; in fact, we have used the principle of action and reaction by considering it, not as an experimental truth, but as the very definition of force. 

This definition is quite as conventional as that of Kirchoff, but it is much less general.
All the forces are not transmitted by the thread (and to compare them they would all have to be transmitted by identical threads). 

If we even admitted that the earth is attached to the sun by an invisible thread, at any rate
it will be agreed that we have no means of measuring
the increment of the thread. 

Nine times out of ten, in consequence, our definition will be in default; no sensethe classical mechanics.

of any kind can be attached to it, and we must fall back
on that of Kirchoff. Why then go on in this roundabout
way? 

You admit a certain definition of force which has a meaning only in certain particular cases. In those cases you verify by experiment that it leads to the law of acceleration. 

On the strength of these experiments you then take the law of acceleration as a definition of force in all the other cases.

Would it not be simpler to consider the law of acceleration as a definition in all cases, and to regard the experiments in question, not as verifications of that law, but as verifications of the principle of action and reaction, or as proving the deformations of an elastic body depend only on the forces acting on that body? 

Without taking into account the fact that the conditions in which your definition could be accepted can only be very imperfectly fulfilled, that a thread is never without mass, that it is never isolated from all other forces than the reaction of the bodies attached to its extremities.

The ideas expounded by M. Andrade are none the less very interesting. If they do not satisfy our logical requirements, they give us a better view of the historical genesis of the fundamental ideas of mechanics. 

The reflections they suggest show us how the human mind passed fromscience and hypothesis 
a naïve anthropomorphism to the present conception of science.

We see that we end with an experiment which is very particular, and as a matter of fact very crude, and we start with a perfectly general law, perfectly precise, the truth of which we regard as absolute. We have, so to speak, freely conferred this certainty on it by looking upon it as a convention.

Are the laws of acceleration and of the composition of forces only arbitrary conventions? Conventions, yes; arbitrary, no—they would be so if we lost sight of the experiments which led the founders of the science to adopt them, and which, imperfect as they were, were sufficient
to justify their adoption. 

It is well from time to time to let our attention dwell on the experimental origin of these conventions.
