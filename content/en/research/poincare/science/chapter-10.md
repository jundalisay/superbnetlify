## Significance of Physical Theories

The ephemeral nature of scientific theories takes by surprise the man of the world. 

Their brief period of prosperity ended, he sees them abandoned one after another; he sees ruins piled upon ruins; he predicts that the theories in fashion to-day will in a short time succumb in their turn, and he concludes that they are absolutely in vain. This is what he calls the bankruptcy of science.

His scepticism is superficial; he does not take into account the object of scientific theories and the part they play, or he would understand that the ruins may be still good for something. 

No theory seemed established on firmer ground than Fresnel’s, which attributed light to the movements of the ether. Then if Maxwell’s theory is today preferred, does that mean that Fresnel’s work was in vain? No; for Fresnel’s object was not to know whether there really is an ether, if it is or is not formed of atoms, if these atoms really move in this way or that; his object was to predict optical phenomena.

This Fresnel’s theory enables us to do to-day as well as it did before Maxwell’s time. The differential equa-the theories of modern physics.

tions are always true, they may be always integrated by the same methods, and the results of this integration still preserve their value. It cannot be said that this is reducing physical theories to simple practical recipes; these equations express relations, and if the equations
remain true, it is because the relations preserve their reality. 

They teach us now, as they did then, that there is such and such a relation between this thing and that;
only, the something which we then called motion, we now call electric current. But these are merely names of the
images we substituted for the real objects which Nature will hide for ever from our eyes. 

The true relations between these real objects are the only reality we can attain,
and the sole condition is that the same relations shall exist between these objects as between the images we are
forced to put in their place. If the relations are known to us, what does it matter if we think it convenient to
replace one image by another?

That a given periodic phenomenon (an electric oscillation, for instance) is really due to the vibration of a
given atom, which, behaving like a pendulum, is really
displaced in this manner or that, all this is neither certain
nor essential. But that there is between the electric oscillation, the movement of the pendulum, and all periodic phenomena an intimate relationship which corresponds to a profound reality; that this relationship, this similar-
ity, or rather this parallelism, is continued in the details;
that it is a consequence of more general principles such
as that of the conservation of energy, and that of least
action; this we may affirm; this is the truth which will
ever remain the same in whatever garb we may see fit to clothe it.

Many theories of dispersion have been proposed. 

The first were imperfect, and contained but little truth. 

Then came that of Helmholtz, and this in its turn was modified in different ways; its author himself conceived another
theory, founded on Maxwell’s principles. 

But the remarkable thing is, that all the scientists who followed Helmholtz obtain the same equations, although their
starting-points were to all appearance widely separated.

I venture to say that these theories are all simultaneously true; not merely because they express a true relation—
that between absorption and abnormal dispersion. 

In the premisses of these theories the part that is true is the part common to all: it is the affirmation of this or
that relation between certain things, which some call by one name and some by another.

The kinetic theory of gases has given rise to many objections, to which it would be difficult to find an answer
were it claimed that the theory is absolutely true. But all
these objections do not alter the fact that it has been use-
ful, particularly in revealing to us one true relation which
would otherwise have remained profoundly hidden—the
relation between gaseous and osmotic pressures. 

In this sense, then, it may be said to be true.

When a physicist finds a contradiction between 2 theories which are equally dear to him, he sometimes
says: “Let us not be troubled, but let us hold fast to the two ends of the chain, lest we lose the intermediate links.”

This argument of the embarrassed theologian would be ridiculous if we were to attribute to physical theories the
interpretation given them by the man of the world. 

In case of contradiction one of them at least should be considered false. But this is no longer the case if we only
seek in them what should be sought. It is quite possible that they both express true relations, and that the
contradictions only exist in the images we have formed to ourselves of reality. 

To those who feel that we are going too far in our limitations of the domain accessible to the scientist, I reply: These questions which we forbid
you to investigate, and which you so regret, are not only insoluble, they are illusory and devoid of meaning.

Such a philosopher claims that all physics can be explained by the mutual impact of atoms. If he simply
means that the same relations obtain between physical
phenomena as between the mutual impact of a large number of billiard balls—well and good! this is verifiable,
and perhaps is true. But he means something more, and we think we understand him, because we think we know
what an impact is. Why? Simply because we have often watched a game of billiards. Are we to understand
that God experiences the same sensations in the contemplation of His work that we do in watching a game of
billiards? 

If it is not our intention to give his assertion
this fantastic meaning, and if we do not wish to give it the
more restricted meaning I have already mentioned, which
is the sound meaning, then it has no meaning at all. Hy-
potheses of this kind have therefore only a metaphorical
sense. 

The scientist should no more banish them than a poet banishes metaphor; but he ought to know what
they are worth. They may be useful to give satisfaction
to the mind, and they will do no harm as long as they
are only indifferent hypotheses.

These considerations explain to us why certain theories, that were thought to be abandoned and definitively
condemned by experiment, are suddenly revived from their ashes and begin a new life. It is because they ex-
pressed true relations, and had not ceased to do so when
for some reason or other we felt it necessary to enunciate
the same relations in another language. Their life had
been latent, as it were.

Barely fifteen years ago, was there anything more
ridiculous, more quaintly old-fashioned, than the fluids
of Coulomb? 

And yet, here they are re-appearing under the name of electrons. In what do these permanently
electrified molecules differ from the electric molecules of
Coulomb? It is true that in the electrons the electricity is
supported by a little, a very little matter; in other words,
they have mass. Yet Coulomb did not deny mass to his
fluids, or if he did, it was with reluctance. It would be
rash to affirm that the belief in electrons will not also
undergo an eclipse, but it was none the less curious to
note this unexpected renaissance.

But the most striking example is Carnot’s principle.

Carnot established it, starting from false hypotheses.

When it was found that heat was indestructible, and
may be converted into work, his ideas were completely
abandoned; later, Clausius returned to them, and to him
is due their definitive triumph. In its primitive form,
Carnot’s theory expressed in addition to true relations,

other inexact relations, the débris of old ideas; but the
presence of the latter did not alter the reality of the
others. Clausius had only to separate them, just as one
lops off dead branches.

The result was the second fundamental law of thermodynamics. The relations were always the same, although
they did not hold, at least to all appearance, between the
same objects. 

This was sufficient for the principle to retain its value. Nor have the reasonings of Carnot perished
on this account; they were applied to an imperfect con-
ception of matter, but their form—i.e., the essential part
of them, remained correct. What I have just said throws
some light at the same time on the rôle of general princi-
ples, such as those of the principle of least action or of the
conservation of energy. 

These principles are of very great value. 

They were obtained in the search for what there was in common in the enunciation of numerous physical
laws; they thus represent the quintessence of innumerable observations. However, from their very generality
results a consequence to which I have called attention in  Chapter 8 that they are no longer capable
of verification. As we cannot give a general definition of energy, the principle of the conservation of energy simply
signifies that there is a something which remains constant. 

Whatever fresh notions of the world may be given us by future experiments, we are certain beforehand that
there is something which remains constant, and which may be called energy. Does this mean that the principle has no meaning and vanishes into a tautology? 

Not at all. 

It means that the different things to which we give the name of energy are connected by a true relation-
ship; it affirms between them a real relation. But then,
if this principle has a meaning, it may be false; it may
be that we have no right to extend indefinitely its appli-
cations, and yet it is certain beforehand to be verified in
the strict sense of the word. How, then, shall we know
when it has been extended as far as is legitimate? Simply
when it ceases to be useful to us—i.e., when we can no
longer use it to predict correctly new phenomena. We
shall be certain in such a case that the relation affirmed
is no longer real, for otherwise it would be fruitful; ex-
periment without directly contradicting a new extension
of the principle will nevertheless have condemned it.
