Every generalisation is a hypothesis. Hypothesis therefore plays a necessary rôle, which no one has ever contested. Only, it should al-
ways be as soon as possible submitted to verification.

It goes without saying that, if it cannot stand this test, it must be abandoned without any hesitation. This is,
indeed, what is generally done; but sometimes with a certain impatience. Ah well! this impatience is not justified. The physicist who has just given up one of his hypotheses should, on the contrary, rejoice, for he found
an unexpected opportunity of discovery. 

His hypothesis had not been lightly adopted, It took into account all the known factors which seem capable of intervention in the phenomenon. If it is not verified, it is because there is something unexpected and extraordinary about it, because we are on the point of finding
something unknown and new. 

Has the hypothesis thus rejected been sterile? Far from it. It may be even said that it has rendered more service than a true hypothesis.

Not only has it been the occasion of a decisive experiment, but if this experiment had been made by chance, without the hypothesis, no conclusion could have been drawn; nothing extraordinary would have been seen; 

Only one fact the more would have been catalogued, without deducing from it the remotest consequence.


Now, under what conditions is the use of hypothesis without danger? The proposal to submit all to experiment is not sufficient. Some hypotheses are dangerous,—first and foremost those which are tacit and unconscious.
And since we make them without knowing them, we can-
not get rid of them. Here again, there is a service that
mathematical physics may render us. By the precisionhypotheses in physics.

which is its characteristic, we are compelled to formulate
all the hypotheses that we would unhesitatingly make
without its aid. Let us also notice that it is important not
to multiply hypotheses indefinitely. If we construct a the-
ory based upon multiple hypotheses, and if experiment
condemns it, which of the premisses must be changed? It
is impossible to tell. Conversely, if the experiment suc-
ceeds, must we suppose that it has verified all these hy-
potheses at once? Can several unknowns be determined
from a single equation?

We must also take care to distinguish between the
different kinds of hypotheses. First of all, there are those
which are quite natural and necessary. It is difficult not
to suppose that the influence of very distant bodies is
quite negligible, that small movements obey a linear law,
and that effect is a continuous function of its cause. I will
say as much for the conditions imposed by symmetry. All
these hypotheses affirm, so to speak, the common basis
of all the theories of mathematical physics. They are the
last that should be abandoned. There is a second cat-
egory of hypotheses which I shall qualify as indifferent.
In most questions the analyst assumes, at the beginning
of his calculations, either that matter is continuous, or
the reverse, that it is formed of atoms. In either case, his results would have been the same. On the atomic
supposition he has a little more difficulty in obtaining them—that is all. If, then, experiment confirms his con-
clusions, will he suppose that he has proved, for example,
the real existence of atoms?

In optical theories two vectors are introduced, one of which we consider as a velocity and the other as a vortex.
This again is an indifferent hypothesis, since we should have arrived at the same conclusions by assuming the
former to be a vortex and the latter to be a velocity.

The success of the experiment cannot prove, therefore, that the first vector is really a velocity. It only proves
one thing—namely, that it is a vector; and that is the only hypothesis that has really been introduced into the
premisses. To give it the concrete appearance that the
fallibility of our minds demands, it was necessary to consider it either as a velocity or as a vortex. In the same
way, it was necessary to represent it by an x or a y, but the result will not prove that we were right or wrong in
regarding it as a velocity; nor will it prove we are right
or wrong in calling it x and not y.
These indifferent hypotheses are never dangerous pro-
vided their characters are not misunderstood. They may
be useful, either as artifices for calculation, or to assisthypotheses in physics.

our understanding by concrete images, to fix the ideas,
as we say. They need not therefore be rejected. The
hypotheses of the third category are real generalisations.
They must be confirmed or invalidated by experiment.
Whether verified or condemned, they will always be fruit-
ful; but, for the reasons I have given, they will only be
so if they are not too numerous.

## Origin of Mathematical Physics

Let us go further and study more closely the conditions which have assisted
the development of mathematical physics. We recognise
at the outset that the efforts of men of science have always
tended to resolve the complex phenomenon given directly
by experiment into a very large number of elementary
phenomena, and that in three different ways.

First, with respect to time. Instead of embracing in its entirety the progressive development of a phenomenon,
we simply try to connect each moment with the one immediately preceding. We admit that the present state of
the world only depends on the immediate past, without being directly influenced, so to speak, by the recollection
of a more distant past. 

Thanks to this postulate, instead
of studying directly the whole succession of phenomena,
we may confine ourselves to writing down its differential
equation; for the laws of Kepler we substitute the law of Newton.
Next, we try to decompose the phenomena in space.

What experiment gives us is a confused aggregate of facts
spread over a scene of considerable extent. We must try
to deduce the elementary phenomenon, which will still
be localised in a very small region of space.
A few examples perhaps will make my meaning
clearer. If we wished to study in all its complexity the
distribution of temperature in a cooling solid, we could
never do so. This is simply because, if we only reflect
that a point in the solid can directly impart some of
its heat to a neighbouring point, it will immediately
impart that heat only to the nearest points, and it is
but gradually that the flow of heat will reach other por-
tions of the solid. The elementary phenomenon is the
interchange of heat between two contiguous points. It is
strictly localised and relatively simple if, as is natural,
we admit that it is not influenced by the temperature of
the molecules whose distance apart is small.

I bend a rod: it takes a very complicated form, the
direct investigation of which would be impossible. But
I can attack the problem, however, if I notice that its
flexure is only the resultant of the deformations of the
very small elements of the rod, and that the deformationhypotheses in physics.

of each of these elements only depends on the forces which
are directly applied to it, and not in the least on those
which may be acting on the other elements.
In all these examples, which may be increased with-
out difficulty, it is admitted that there is no action at a
distance or at great distances. That is an hypothesis. It
is not always true, as the law of gravitation proves. It
must therefore be verified. If it is confirmed, even approx-
imately, it is valuable, for it helps us to use mathematical
physics, at any rate by successive approximations. If it
does not stand the test, we must seek something else that
is analogous, for there are other means of arriving at the
elementary phenomenon. If several bodies act simultane-
ously, it may happen that their actions are independent,
and may be added one to the other, either as vectors
or as scalar quantities. The elementary phenomenon is
then the action of an isolated body. Or suppose, again,
it is a question of small movements, or more generally of
small variations which obey the well-known law of mu-
tual or relative independence. The movement observed
will then be decomposed into simple movements—for ex-
ample, sound into its harmonics, and white light into its
monochromatic components. When we have discovered
in which direction to seek for the elementary phenom-science and hypothesis

ena, by what means may we reach it? First, it will often
happen that in order to predict it, or rather in order
to predict what is useful to us, it will not be necessary
to know its mechanism. The law of great numbers will
suffice. Take for example the propagation of heat. Each
molecule radiates towards its neighbour—we need not in-
quire according to what law; and if we make any suppo-
sition in this respect, it will be an indifferent hypothesis,
and therefore useless and unverifiable. In fact, by the
action of averages and thanks to the symmetry of the
medium, all differences are levelled, and, whatever the
hypothesis may be, the result is always the same.
The same feature is presented in the theory of elastic-
ity, and in that of capillarity. The neighbouring molecules
attract and repel each other, we need not inquire by what
law. It is enough for us that this attraction is sensible
at small distances only, and that the molecules are very
numerous, that the medium is symmetrical, and we have
only to let the law of great numbers come into play.

Here again the simplicity of the elementary phenomenon is hidden beneath the complexity of the observable resultant phenomenon; but in its turn this
simplicity was only apparent and disguised a very complex mechanism. Evidently the best means of reaching the elementary phenomenon would be experiment. It would be necessary by experimental artifices to disso-
ciate the complex system which nature offers for our
investigations and carefully to study the elements as
dissociated as possible; for example, natural white light
would be decomposed into monochromatic lights by the
aid of the prism, and into polarised lights by the aid of
the polariser. Unfortunately, that is neither always pos-
sible nor always sufficient, and sometimes the mind must
run ahead of experiment. I shall only give one example
which has always struck me rather forcibly. If I decom-
pose white light, I shall be able to isolate a portion of the
spectrum, but however small it may be, it will always
be a certain width. In the same way the natural lights
which are called monochromatic give us a very fine ray,
but one which is not, however, infinitely fine. It might be
supposed that in the experimental study of the properties
of these natural lights, by operating with finer and finer
rays, and passing on at last to the limit, so to speak, we
should eventually obtain the properties of a rigorously
monochromatic light. That would not be accurate. I
assume that two rays emanate from the same source,
that they are first polarised in planes at right angles,
that they are then brought back again to the same plane of polarisation, and that we try to obtain interference. If
the light were rigorously monochromatic, there would be
interference; but with our nearly monochromatic lights,
there will be no interference, and that, however narrow
the ray may be. For it to be otherwise, the ray would
have to be several million times finer than the finest
known rays.
Here then we should be led astray by proceeding to
the limit. The mind has to run ahead of the experiment,
and if it has done so with success, it is because it has al-
lowed itself to be guided by the instinct of simplicity. The
knowledge of the elementary fact enables us to state the
problem in the form of an equation. It only remains to
deduce from it by combination the observable and verifi-
able complex fact. That is what we call integration, and it
is the province of the mathematician. It might be asked,
why in physical science generalisation so readily takes
the mathematical form. The reason is now easy to see.
It is not only because we have to express numerical laws;
it is because the observable phenomenon is due to the
superposition of a large number of elementary phenom-
ena which are all similar to each other ; and in this way
differential equations are quite naturally introduced. It
is not enough that each elementary phenomenon shouldhypotheses in physics.

obey simple laws: all those that we have to combine must
obey the same law; then only is the intervention of mathematics of any use. Mathematics teaches us, in fact, to
combine like with like. Its object is to divine the result of
a combination without having to reconstruct that combination element by element. If we have to repeat the
same operation several times, mathematics enables us to
avoid this repetition by telling the result beforehand by
a kind of induction. This I have explained before in the
chapter on mathematical reasoning. 

But for that purpose all these operations must be similar; in the contrary case we must evidently make up our minds to working
them out in full one after the other, and mathematics will be useless. It is therefore, thanks to the approxi-
mate homogeneity of the matter studied by physicists, that mathematical physics came into existence. In the
natural sciences the following conditions are no longer
to be found:—homogeneity, relative independence of re-
mote parts, simplicity of the elementary fact; and that is
why the student of natural science is compelled to have
recourse to other modes of generalisation.
