What has that calculus to do with physical science? 

<!-- The questions I shall raise—without, however, giving them
a solution—are naturally raised by the philosopher who is examining the problems of physics. So far is this the
case, that in the two preceding chapters I have several times used the words “probability” and “chance.”  -->

“Predicted facts can only be probable.”

However solidly founded a prediction may appear to be, we are never absolutely certain that experiment will not prove it false; but the probability is often so great that practically it may be accepted. And a little farther on I added:—“See what a part the belief in simplicity plays in our generalisations. 

We have verified a simple law in a large number of particular cases, and we refuse to admit that this so-often-repeated coincidence is a mere effect
of chance.” 

Thus, in a multitude of circumstances the physicist is often in the same position as the gambler who reckons up his chances. Every time that he reasons by induction, he more or less consciously requires the calculus of probabilities, and that is why I am obliged to
open this chapter parenthetically, and to interrupt our discussion of method in the physical sciences in order to
examine a little closer what this calculus is worth, and what dependence we may place upon it. The very name
of the calculus of probabilities is a paradox. 

Probability as opposed to certainty is what one does not know, and how can we calculate the unknown? 

Yet many eminent scientists have devoted themselves to this calculus, and it cannot be denied that science has drawn therefrom no
small advantage. How can we explain this apparent contradiction? 

Has probability been defined? Can it even be defined?


If it cannot, how can we venture to reason upon it?

The definition, it will be said, is very simple. 

The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favourable to the event to the total number of pos-
sible cases. 

A simple example will show how incomplete this definition is:—I throw two dice. 

What is the probability that one of the two at least turns up a 6? 

Each can turn up in six different ways; the number of possi-
ble cases is 6 × 6 = 36. The number of favourable cases
11
is 11; the probability is . That is the correct solution.
36
But why cannot we just as well proceed as follows?—Thescience and hypothesis
206
6 × 7
points which turn up on the two dice form

different combinations. Among these combinations, six

are favourable; the probability is
. Now why is the
21
first method of calculating the number of possible cases
more legitimate than the second? In any case it is not the
definition that tells us. 

We are therefore bound to complete the definition by saying, “. . . to the total number of
possible cases, provided the cases are equally probable.”

So we are compelled to define the probable by the probable. 

How can we know that two possible cases are equally probable? 

Will it be by a convention? 

If we insert at the beginning of every problem an explicit convention, well and good! We then have nothing to do but to apply the
rules of arithmetic and algebra, and we complete our cal-
culation, when our result cannot be called in question.

But if we wish to make the slightest application of this result, we must prove that our convention is legitimate,
and we shall find ourselves in the presence of the very difficulty we thought we had avoided. It may be said that
common-sense is enough to show us the convention that should be adopted. 

Alas! M. Bertrand has amused himself by discussing the following simple problem:—“What is the probability that a chord of a circle may be greaterthe calculus of probabilities.

207
than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle?” 

The illustrious geometer successively adopted two conventions which seemed to be equally imperative in the eyes of
common-sense, and with one convention he finds 12 , and with the other 13 . 

The conclusion which seems to follow from this is that the calculus of probabilities is a useless
science, that the obscure instinct which we call common-sense, and to which we appeal for the legitimisation of
our conventions, must be distrusted. 

But to this conclusion we can no longer subscribe. We cannot do without that obscure instinct. Without it, science would be im-
possible, and without it we could neither discover nor apply a law. Have we any right, for instance, to enun-
ciate Newton’s law? No doubt numerous observations are in agreement with it, but is not that a simple fact
of chance? and how do we know, besides, that this law
which has been true for so many generations will not be
untrue in the next? To this objection the only answer you
can give is: It is very improbable. But grant the law. By
means of it I can calculate the position of Jupiter in a
year from now. Yet have I any right to say this? Who
can tell if a gigantic mass of enormous velocity is not
going to pass near the solar system and produce unfore-
seen perturbations? Here again the only answer is: It is very improbable. From this point of view all the sciences
would only be unconscious applications of the calculus of probabilities. And if this calculus be condemned, then
the whole of the sciences must also be condemned. 

I shall not dwell at length on scientific problems in which the intervention of the calculus of probabilities is more evident.
In the forefront of these is the problem of interpolation, in which, knowing a certain number of values of a function,
we try to discover the intermediary values. 

I may also mention the celebrated theory of errors of observation,
to which I shall return later; 

The kinetic theory of gases is a well-known hypothesis wherein each gaseous molecule
is supposed to describe an extremely complicated path,
but in which, through the effect of great numbers, the
mean phenomena which are all we observe obey the sim-
ple laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac. 

All these theories are based upon the laws of great numbers, and the calculus of probabilities would evidently involve them in its
ruin. It is true that they have only a particular interest, and that, save as far as interpolation is concerned, they
are sacrifices to which we might readily be resigned. 

But it would not be these partial sacrifices that would be in question; it would be the legitimacy of the whole of science that would be challenged. I quite seethe calculus of probabilities.

that it might be said: We do not know, and yet we must
act. As for action, we have not time to devote ourselves
to an inquiry that will suffice to dispel our ignorance.

Besides, such an inquiry would demand unlimited time.

We must therefore make up our minds without knowing.

This must be often done whatever may happen, and we must follow the rules although we may have but little
confidence in them. What I know is, not that such a thing is true, but that the best course for me is to act as
if it were true. 

The calculus of probabilities, and therefore science itself, would be no longer of any practical value.

Unfortunately the difficulty does not thus disappear.

A gambler wants to try a coup, and he asks my advice.

If I give it him, I use the calculus of probabilities; but I shall not guarantee success. That is what I shall call
subjective probability. In this case we might be content with the explanation of which I have just given a sketch.
But assume that an observer is present at the play, that he knows of the coup, and that play goes on for a long
time, and that he makes a summary of his notes.

He will find that events have taken place in conformity with the laws of the calculus of probabilities. That is what I
shall call objective probability, and it is this phenomenon which has to be explained. There are numerous Insur-
ance Societies which apply the rules of the calculus of probabilities, and they distribute to their shareholders
dividends, the objective reality of which cannot be contested. In order to explain them, we must do more than
invoke our ignorance and the necessity of action. 

Thus, absolute scepticism is not admissible. We may distrust, but we cannot condemn en bloc. Discussion is necessary.
I. Classification of the Problems of Probability.—In order to classify the problems which are presented to us
with reference to probabilities, we must look at them from different points of view, and first of all, from that
of generality. I said above that probability is the ratio of the number of favourable to the number of possible
cases. What for want of a better term I call generality will increase with the number of possible cases. This
number may be finite, as, for instance, if we take a throw of the dice in which the number of possible cases is 36.

That is the first degree of generality. But if we ask, for
instance, what is the probability that a point within a
circle is within the inscribed square, there are as many
possible cases as there are points in the circle—that is to
say, an infinite number. This is the second degree of generality. Generality can be pushed further still. We may ask the probability that a function will satisfy a given
condition. 

There are then as many possible cases as one can imagine different functions. This is the third degree
of generality, which we reach, for instance, when we try
to find the most probable law after a finite number of
observations. 

Yet we may place ourselves at a quite different point of view. If we were not ignorant there would
be no probability, there could only be certainty. But our
ignorance cannot be absolute, for then there would be
no longer any probability at all. 

Thus the problems of probability may be classed according to the greater or
less depth of this ignorance. In mathematics we may set
ourselves problems in probability. What is the probabil-
ity that the fifth decimal of a logarithm taken at random
from a table is a 9. 

There is no hesitation in answering 1. Here we possess all the data
that this probability is 10
of the problem. 

We can calculate our logarithm without having recourse to the table, but we need not give our-
selves the trouble. This is the first degree of ignorance.
In the physical sciences our ignorance is already greater.
The state of a system at a given moment depends on
two things—its initial state, and the law according to
which that state varies. If we know both this law and
this initial state, we have a simple mathematical problem to solve, and we fall back upon our first degree of
ignorance. Then it often happens that we know the law
and do not know the initial state.
