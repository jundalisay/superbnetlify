If the concept of geometrical space is not imposed upon our minds, and if, on the other hand, none of our sensations can furnish us with that concept, how then did it ever come into existence?

None of our sensations, if isolated, could have brought us to the concept of space; we are brought to it solely by studying the laws by which those sensations succeed one another. 

We see at first that our impressions are subject to change; but among the changes that we ascertain, we are very soonscience and hypothesis led to make a distinction. Sometimes we say that the objects, the causes of these impressions, have changed
their state, sometimes that they have changed their position, that they have only been displaced. 

Whether an object changes its state or only its position, this is always translated for us in the same manner, by a modification in an aggregate of impressions. How then have we been
enabled to distinguish them? 

If there were only change of position, we could restore the primitive aggregate of impressions by making movements which would confront us with the movable object in the same relative situation. We thus correct the modification which was produced, and we re-establish the initial state by an inverse modification. 

If, for example, it were a question of the sight, and if an object be displaced before our eyes, we
can “follow it with the eye,” and retain its image on the
same point of the retina by appropriate movements of the
eyeball. These movements we are conscious of because
they are voluntary, and because they are accompanied
by muscular sensations. 

But that does not mean that we represent them to ourselves in geometrical space. So
what characterises change of position, what distinguishes
it from change of state, is that it can always be corrected
by this means. It may therefore happen that we passspace and geometry.

from the aggregate of impressions A to the aggregate B
in two different ways. 

First, involuntarily and without experiencing muscular sensations—which happens when
it is the object that is displaced; secondly, voluntarily,
and with muscular sensation—which happens when the
object is motionless, but when we displace ourselves in
such a way that the object has relative motion with re-
spect to us. 

If this be so, the translation of the aggregate A to the aggregate B is only a change of position. It follows that sight and touch could not have given us the
idea of space without the help of the “muscular sense.”

Not only could this concept not be derived from a single sensation, or even from a series of sensations; but a motionless being could never have acquired it, because, not
being able to correct by his movements the effects of the
change of position of external objects, he would have had
no reason to distinguish them from changes of state. Nor
would he have been able to acquire it if his movements
had not been voluntary, or if they were unaccompanied
by any sensations whatever.


## Conditions of Compensation

How is such a compensation possible in such a way that two changes, otherwise mutually independent, may be reciprocally corrected? 

A mind already familiar with geometry would science and hypothesis reason as follows:—If there is to be compensation, the different parts of the external object on the one hand, and
the different organs of our senses on the other, must be in
the same relative position after the double change. 

And for that to be the case, the different parts of the external
body on the one hand, and the different organs of our
senses on the other, must have the same relative position
to each other after the double change; and so with the
different parts of our body with respect to each other. In
other words, the external object in the first change must
be displaced as an invariable solid would be displaced,
and it must also be so with the whole of our body in the
second change, which is to correct the first. Under these
conditions compensation may be produced. But we who
as yet know nothing of geometry, whose ideas of space are
not yet formed, we cannot reason in this way—we cannot
predict à priori if compensation is possible. But experi-
ment shows us that it sometimes does take place, and we
start from this experimental fact in order to distinguish
changes of state from changes of position.

Solid Bodies and Geometry.—Among surrounding ob-
jects there are some which frequently experience displace-
ments that may be thus corrected by a correlative move-
ment of our own body—namely, solid bodies. The other objects, whose form is variable, only in exceptional cir-
cumstances undergo similar displacement (change of position without change of form). When the displacement
of a body takes place with deformation, we can no longer
by appropriate movements place the organs of our body
in the same relative situation with respect to this body;
we can no longer, therefore, reconstruct the primitive ag-
gregate of impressions.

It is only later, and after a series of new experiments,
that we learn how to decompose a body of variable form
into smaller elements such that each is displaced approx-
imately according to the same laws as solid bodies. We
thus distinguish “deformations” from other changes of
state. In these deformations each element undergoes a
simple change of position which may be corrected; but
the modification of the aggregate is more profound, and
can no longer be corrected by a correlative movement.
Such a concept is very complex even at this stage, and
has been relatively slow in its appearance. It would not
have been conceived at all had not the observation of solid
bodies shown us beforehand how to distinguish changes
of position.
If, then, there were no solid bodies in nature there
would be no geometry.

Suppose a solid body to occupy successively the positions `α` and `β`. In the first position, it will give us an aggregate of
impressions A, and in the second position the aggregate of impressions B. Now let there be a second solid body,
of qualities entirely different from the first—of different
colour, for instance. 

Assume it to pass from the position `α`, where it gives us the aggregate of impressions A 0
to the position β, where it gives the aggregate of impres-
sions B 0. 

In general, the aggregate A will have nothing in
common with the aggregate A 0 , nor will the aggregate B
have anything in common with the aggregate B 0 . 

The transition from the aggregate A to the aggregate B, and
that of the aggregate A 0 to the aggregate B 0 , are therefore
two changes which in themselves have in general nothing
in common. Yet we consider both these changes as dis-
placements; and, further, we consider them the same dis-
placement. How can this be? It is simply because they
may be both corrected by the same correlative movement
of our body. “Correlative movement,” therefore, consti-
tutes the sole connection between two phenomena which
otherwise we should never have dreamed of connecting.
On the other hand, our body, thanks to the number
of its articulations and muscles, may have a multitudespace and geometry.

of different movements, but all are not capable of “cor-
recting” a modification of external objects; those alone
are capable of it in which our whole body, or at least all
those in which the organs of our senses enter into play
are displaced en bloc—i.e., without any variation of their
relative positions, as in the case of a solid body.

To sum up:

1. We distinguish 2 categories of phenomena:
  - involuntary: these are unaccompanied by muscular sensations, and attributed to external objects—they are external changes;
  - voluntary the second, of opposite char-
acter and attributed to the movements of our own body,
are internal changes.

2. We notice that certain changes of each in these categories may be corrected by a correlative change of the other category.

3. We distinguish among external changes those that
have a correlative in the other category—which we call
displacements; and in the same way we distinguish among
the internal changes those which have a correlative in the
first category.
Thus by means of this reciprocity is defined a partic-
ular class of phenomena called displacements. The laws
of these phenomena are the object of geometry.science and hypothesis
