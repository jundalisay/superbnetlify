6. Experiments only teach us the relations of bodies to one another. 

They do not and cannot give us the relations of bodies and space, nor the mutual relations of the different parts of space. 

“Yes!” you reply, “a single experiment is not enough, because it only gives us
one equation with several unknowns; but when I have made enough experiments I shall have enough equations
to calculate all my unknowns.” If I know the height of the main-mast, that is not sufficient to enable me to calculate
the age of the captain. 

When you have measured every fragment of wood in a ship you will have many equations, but you will be no nearer knowing the captain’s age. 

All your measurements bearing on your fragments of wood can tell you only what concerns those fragments;
and similarly, your experiments, however numerous they may be, referring only to the relations of bodies with one
another, will tell you nothing about the mutual relations
of the different parts of space.

7. Will you say that if the experiments have reference to the bodies, they at least have reference to the
geometrical properties of the bodies. 

First, what do you understand by the geometrical properties of bodies? 

I assume that it is a question of the relations of the bodies
to space. 

These properties therefore are not reached by experiments which only have reference to the relations of
bodies to one another, and that is enough to show that
it is not of those properties that there can be a ques-
tion. Let us therefore begin by making ourselves clear
as to the sense of the phrase: geometrical properties of
bodies. When I say that a body is composed of several
parts, I presume that I am thus enunciating a geometri-
cal property, and that will be true even if I agree to give
the improper name of points to the very small parts I am
considering. When I say that this or that part of a cer-
tain body is in contact with this or that part of another
body, I am enunciating a proposition which concerns the
mutual relations of the two bodies, and not their rela-experiment and geometry.

tions with space. I assume that you will agree with me
that these are not geometrical properties. I am sure that
at least you will grant that these properties are indepen-
dent of all knowledge of metrical geometry. Admitting
this, I suppose that we have a solid body formed of eight
thin iron rods, oa, ob, oc, od, oe, of , og, oh, connected
at one of their extremities, o. And let us take a second
solid body—for example, a piece of wood, on which are
marked three little spots of ink which I shall call α β γ.
I now suppose that we find that we can bring into con-
tact αβγ with ago; by that I mean α with a, and at the
same time β with g, and γ with o. Then we can suc-
cessively bring into contact αβγ with bgo, cgo, dgo, ego,
f go, then with aho, bho, cho, dho, eho, f ho; and then
αγ successively with ab, bc, cd, de, ef , f a. Now these are
observations that can be made without having any idea
beforehand as to the form or the metrical properties of
space. They have no reference whatever to the “geometri-
cal properties of bodies.” These observations will not be
possible if the bodies on which we experiment move in a
group having the same structure as the Lobatschewskian
group (I mean according to the same laws as solid bodies
in Lobatschewsky’s geometry). They therefore suffice to
prove that these bodies move according to the Euclideanscience and hypothesis

group; or at least that they do not move according to
the Lobatschewskian group. That they may be compati-
ble with the Euclidean group is easily seen; for we might
make them so if the body αβγ were an invariable solid
of our ordinary geometry in the shape of a right-angled
triangle, and if the points abcdef gh were the vertices of
a polyhedron formed of two regular hexagonal pyramids
of our ordinary geometry having abcdef as their common
base, and having the one g and the other h as their ver-
tices. Suppose now, instead of the previous observations,
we note that we can as before apply αβγ successively
to ago, bgo, cgo, dgo, ego, f go, aho, bho, cho, dho, eho,
f ho, and then that we can apply αβ (and no longer αγ)
successively to ab, bc, cd, de, ef , and f a. These are ob-
servations that could be made if non-Euclidean geometry
were true. If the bodies αβγ, oabcdef gh were invariable
solids, if the former were a right-angled triangle, and
the latter a double regular hexagonal pyramid of suit-
able dimensions. These new verifications are therefore
impossible if the bodies move according to the Euclidean
group; but they become possible if we suppose the bodies
to move according to the Lobatschewskian group. They
would therefore suffice to show, if we carried them out,
that the bodies in question do not move according to theexperiment and geometry.

Euclidean group. And so, without making any hypothe-
sis on the form and the nature of space, on the relations
of the bodies and space, and without attributing to bod-
ies any geometrical property, I have made observations
which have enabled me to show in one case that the bod-
ies experimented upon move according to a group, the
structure of which is Euclidean, and in the other case,
that they move in a group, the structure of which is Lo-
batschewskian. It cannot be said that all the first ob-
servations would constitute an experiment proving that
space is Euclidean, and the second an experiment proving
that space is non-Euclidean; in fact, it might be imagined
(note that I use the word imagined ) that there are bod-
ies moving in such a manner as to render possible the
second series of observations: and the proof is that the
first mechanic who came our way could construct it if he
would only take the trouble. But you must not conclude,
however, that space is non-Euclidean. In the same way,
just as ordinary solid bodies would continue to exist when
the mechanic had constructed the strange bodies I have
just mentioned, he would have to conclude that space
is both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. Suppose, for in-
stance, that we have a large sphere of radius R, and that
its temperature decreases from the centre to the surface of the sphere according to the law of which I spoke when I
was describing the non-Euclidean world. 

We might have bodies whose dilatation is negligible, and which would
behave as ordinary invariable solids; and, on the other
hand, we might have very dilatable bodies, which would
behave as non-Euclidean solids. 

We might have two double pyramids oabcdef gh and o 0 a 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e 0 f 0 g 0 h 0 , and two tri-
angles αβγ and α 0 β 0 γ 0 . The first double pyramid would
be rectilinear, and the second curvilinear. The trian-
gle αβγ would consist of undilatable matter, and the
other of very dilatable matter. We might therefore make
our first observations with the double pyramid o 0 a 0 h 0 and
the triangle α 0 β 0 γ 0 .

And then the experiment would seem to show—first, that Euclidean geometry is true, and then that it is false.
Hence, experiments have reference not to space but to
bodies.

8. To round the matter off, I ought to speak of a very
delicate question, which will require considerable devel-
opment; but I shall confine myself to summing up what I
have written in the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale
and in the Monist. When we say that space has threeexperiment and geometry.


dimensions, what do we mean? We have seen the impor-
tance of these “internal changes” which are revealed to
us by our muscular sensations. They may serve to char-
acterise the different attitudes of our body. Let us take
arbitrarily as our origin one of these attitudes, A. When
we pass from this initial attitude to another attitude B
we experience a series of muscular sensations, and this
series S of muscular sensations will define B. Observe,
however, that we shall often look upon two series S and S 0
as defining the same attitude B (since the initial and fi-
nal attitudes A and B remaining the same, the intermedi-
ary attitudes of the corresponding sensations may differ).
How then can we recognise the equivalence of these two
series? Because they may serve to compensate for the
same external change, or more generally, because, when
it is a question of compensation for an external change,
one of the series may be replaced by the other. Among
these series we have distinguished those which can alone
compensate for an external change, and which we have
called “displacements.” As we cannot distinguish two dis-
placements which are very close together, the aggregate
of these displacements presents the characteristics of a
physical continuum. Experience teaches us that they are
the characteristics of a physical continuum of six dimen-science and hypothesis

sions; but we do not know as yet how many dimensions
space itself possesses, so we must first of all answer an-
other question. What is a point in space? Every one
thinks he knows, but that is an illusion. What we see
when we try to represent to ourselves a point in space is
a black spot on white paper, a spot of chalk on a black-
board, always an object. The question should therefore
be understood as follows:—What do I mean when I say
the object B is at the point which a moment before was
occupied by the object A? Again, what criterion will
enable me to recognise it? I mean that although I have
not moved (my muscular sense tells me this), my finger,
which just now touched the object A, is now touching
the object B. I might have used other criteria—for in-
stance, another finger or the sense of sight—but the first
criterion is sufficient. I know that if it answers in the
affirmative all other criteria will give the same answer. I
know it from experiment. I cannot know it à priori. For
the same reason I say that touch cannot be exercised at
a distance; that is another way of enunciating the same
experimental fact. If I say, on the contrary, that sight is
exercised at a distance, it means that the criterion fur-
nished by sight may give an affirmative answer while the
others reply in the negative.experiment and geometry.

To sum up. For each attitude of my body my finger
determines a point, and it is that and that only which
defines a point in space. To each attitude corresponds
in this way a point. But it often happens that the same
point corresponds to several different attitudes (in this
case we say that our finger has not moved, but the rest of
our body has). We distinguish, therefore, among changes
of attitude those in which the finger does not move. How
are we led to this? It is because we often remark that in
these changes the object which is in touch with the finger
remains in contact with it. Let us arrange then in the
same class all the attitudes which are deduced one from
the other by one of the changes that we have thus dis-
tinguished. To all these attitudes of the same class will
correspond the same point in space. Then to each class
will correspond a point, and to each point a class. Yet it
may be said that what we get from this experiment is not
the point, but the class of changes, or, better still, the
corresponding class of muscular sensations. Thus, when
we say that space has three dimensions, we merely mean
that the aggregate of these classes appears to us with the
characteristics of a physical continuum of three dimen-
sions. Then if, instead of defining the points in space
with the aid of the first finger, I use, for example, another finger, would the results be the same? 

That is by no means à priori evident. But, as we have seen, experi-
ment has shown us that all our criteria are in agreement,
and this enables us to answer in the affirmative. If we
recur to what we have called displacements, the aggre-
gate of which forms, as we have seen, a group, we shall
be brought to distinguish those in which a finger does
not move; and by what has preceded, those are the dis-
placements which characterise a point in space, and their
aggregate will form a sub-group of our group. To each
sub-group of this kind, then, will correspond a point in
space. We might be tempted to conclude that experiment
has taught us the number of dimensions of space; but in
reality our experiments have referred not to space, but
to our body and its relations with neighbouring objects.
What is more, our experiments are exceeding crude. In
our mind the latent idea of a certain number of groups
pre-existed; these are the groups with which Lie’s theory
is concerned. 

Which shall we choose to form a kind of
standard by which to compare natural phenomena? 

When this group is chosen, which of the sub-groups shall
we take to characterise a point in space?

Experiment has guided us by showing us what choice adapts itself best to the properties of our body; but there its rôle ends.
