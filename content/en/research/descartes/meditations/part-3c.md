<!-- With regard to the clear and distinct elements in my ideas of bodies, it appears that I could have borrowed some of these from my idea of myself, namely substance, duration, number and anything else of this kind. --> These external ideas and causes are made of substance. For example, I think that a stone is a substance, or is a thing capable of existing independently. I also think that I am a substance.

I think of:
- myself as a thing that thinks and is not extended
- the stone as a thing that is extended and does not think so that the two conceptions differ enormously

But they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common. 

<!-- Again, I perceive that I now exist, and remember that I have existed for some time; moreover, I have various thoughts that I can count; it is in these ways that I acquire the ideas of duration and number that I can then transfer to other things. 

As for all the other elements that make up the ideas of bodies – extension, shape, position and movement – these are not straightforwardly contained in me, since I am nothing but a thinking thing; but since they are merely modes of a substance, and I am a substance, it seems possible that they are contained in me in some higher form. 

That is, I am not myself extended, shaped etc., but because I am a substance I am (so to speak) metaphysically one up on these mere modes, which implies that I can contain within me whatever it takes to cause the ideas of them. -->

External objects come from external ideas, of which the only remaining idea is the <!-- So there remains only --> the idea of God. <!--  is there anything in that which couldn’t have originated in myself?  -->

‘God’ means a substance that is infinite, eternal, unchangeable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, which created myself and anything else that may exist. 

<!-- The more carefully I concentrate on these attributes, the less possible it seems that any of them could have originated from me alone. So this whole discussion implies that God necessarily exists. -->

I am also a substance having the idea of substance. But it does not explain my having the idea of an infinite substance since I am finite. That must come from some substance that is infinite.

One might say that this is wrong because my idea of the infinite comes from me negating the finite. <!-- , just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are arrived at by negating movement and light.  -->

<!-- That would be a mistake, however. I clearly understand that  -->

I answer that there is more reality in an infinite substance than in a finite one. Hence, my perception of the infinite, i.e. God, is prior to my perception of the finite, i.e. myself. 

<!-- Whenever I know that I doubt something or want something, I understand that I lack something and am therefore not wholly perfect. How could I grasp this unless I had an idea of a perfect being, which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison? Nor can it be said that this idea of God could be ‘materially false’, and thus have come from nothing, as may be the case (I noted this a few moments ago) with the ideas of heat and cold. -->

On the contrary, it:
- is utterly clear and distinct
- contains in itself more representative reality than any other idea
  - that is, it stands for something that is grander, more powerful, more real, than any other idea stands for
  - it is less open to the suspicion of falsehood than any other idea. 

This idea of God <!-- a supremely perfect and infinite being is, I say, --> is true in the highest degree. One might imagine that God does not exist. But the idea of God cannot possibly <!--  can’t be supposed that the idea of such a being --> represent and unreal something <!-- in the way that the idea of cold perhaps does -->. 

The idea is utterly clear and distinct. 

It does not matter that I do not totally grasp the infinite, or that there are countless additional attributes of God that I cannot grasp in my thought. This is because the infinite has a nature that cannot be grasped by a finite being like myself. 

It is enough that I understand what is the infinite. <!-- , and that I judge that all the attributes that I clearly perceive and know to imply some perfection – and perhaps countless others of which I am ignorant – are present in God either straightforwardly or in some higher form. -->  This is enough to make my idea of God the truest, clearest and most distinct of all my ideas.

Here is a possible objection to that line of thought. 

Perhaps I am greater than I understand, and will be as perfect as God eventually. <!-- .  perhaps all the perfections that I attribute to God are ones that I do have in some potential form, and they merely haven’t yet shown themselves in actuality. My knowledge is gradually increasing, and I see no obstacle to its going on increasing to infinity. I might then be able to use this increased and eventually infinite knowledge to acquire all the other perfections of God. In that case, I already have the potentiality for these perfections – why shouldn’t this potentiality be enough to enable me to have caused the idea of them that is, to have caused my idea of God·? But all this is impossible for three reasons. -->


But this is wrong for the following reasons:

1. My knowledge and potentialities are increasing. But these are all irrelevant to the idea of God. 

The idea of God contains absolutely nothing that is potential. <!-- Indeed, this gradual increase in knowledge is itself the surest sign of imperfection, because if I am learning more, that shows that there are things I don’t know, and that is an imperfection in me. What is more, -->

2. Even if my knowledge increases forever, it will never actually be infinite since it will never reach the absolute point where it can no longer increase. 

God, on the other hand, is actually infinite. Nothing can be added to his perfection. 

3. Potential being is nothing; what it takes to cause the representative being of an idea is actual being.

<!-- If one concentrates carefully, all this is quite evident by the natural light. But when I relax my concentration, and my mental vision is blurred by the images of things I perceive by the senses, I lose sight of the reasons why my idea of more perfect being has to come from a being that really is more perfect. So I want to push on with my enquiry, now asking a new question:  -->

If the God didn’t exist, could I exist? 

The answer to this will give a new proof of God's existence. <!--  of a perfect being – a proof that it will be easier for me to keep in mind even when I relax my concentration. -->

If God did not exist, from what would I derive my existence? 

It would have to come from:
- myself
- my parents
- some other beings less perfect than God<!--  (a being more perfect than God, or even one as perfect, is unthinkable). -->


### My Existence from Myself

If I had derived my existence from myself, then I would not doubt<!--  or want or lack --> anything at all since I <!-- ; for I would have given myself all the perfections of which I have any idea. So I --> would be God.

<!-- Here is a thought that might seem to undercut that argument.  -->

Perhaps I have always existed and I would not need a cause. <!-- In that case, wouldn’t it follow that there need be no cause for my existence? No, it does not follow. -->

A life-span can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others. My existence at one time doesn’t follow that I exist at later times, unless some cause keeps me in existence. That cause creates me afresh at each moment.

The nature of time is different in the time for <!--  will understand that what it takes to --> bringing something into existence, and the time needed to keep a thing existing. <!--  is also needed to keep it in existence at each moment of its duration.  -->

Thus, there is no real distinction between preservation and creation – only a conceptual one. This is exposed by the natural light.

Do I have the power to exist forever? 

I do not. My continued existence depends on some being other than myself.

<!-- So I have to ask myself whether I have the power to bring it about that I, who now exist, will still exist a minute from now.  -->

<!-- For since I am nothing but a thinking thing – or anyway that is the only part of me that I am now concerned with – if I had such a power I would undoubtedly be aware of it. 

But I experience no such power, and this shows me quite clearly that  -->



<!-- Perhaps this being is not God, though. Perhaps I was produced by causes less perfect than God, such as my parents. 

No; for as I have said before, it is quite clear that there must be at least as much reality or perfection in the cause as in the effect. 

Therefore, given that I am a thinking thing and have within me some idea of God, the cause of me – whatever it is – must itself be a thinking thing and must have the idea of all the perfections that I attribute to God. What is the cause of this cause of me?

If it is the cause of its own existence, then it is God; for if it has the power of existing through its own strength, then undoubtedly it also has the power of actually possessing all the perfections of which it has an idea – that is, all the perfections that I conceive to be in God.

If on the other hand it gets its existence from another cause, then the question arises all over again regarding this further cause= Does it get its existence from itself or from another cause? Eventually we must reach the ultimate cause, and this will be God.

It is clear enough that this sequence of causes of causes can’t run back to infinity, especially since I am dealing with the cause that not only produced me in the past but also preserves me at the present moment.

One might think this= Several partial causes contributed to my creation; I received the idea of one of the perfections that I attribute to God from one cause, and the idea of another from another.

Each perfection is to be found somewhere in the universe, but no one thing has them all.

That can’t be right, because God’s simplicity – that is, the unity or inseparability of all his attributes – is one of the most important of the perfections that I understand him to have. 

The idea of his perfections as united in a single substance couldn’t have been placed in me by any cause that didn’t also provide me with the ideas of the perfections themselves; for no cause could have made me understand that the perfections are united without at the same time showing me what they are. -->


### My Existence from My Parents

<!-- Lastly, as regards my parents, even if everything I have ever believed about them is true, it is certainly not they who -->

My parents do not keep me in existence. They did not even form my mind. <!-- Insofar as I am a thinking thing, indeed, they did not even make me; --> They merely brought about an arrangement of matter that contains me. <!-- (that is, containing my mind, for that is all I now take myself to be). So my parents can’t be the cause-of-me that I am enquiring about. -->

<!-- Given the failure of every other candidacy for the role of cause of me and of my idea of a most perfect being, I infer that the only successful candidacy is God’s.  -->

Thus, I conclude that the mere fact that I exist and have within me an idea of God proves that God exists.

How did I receive this idea from God? 

I did not get it from the senses*. It has never come to me unexpectedly, as do most of the ideas that occur when I seem to see and touch and hear things. 


> *Superphysics note: It comes from the intuitional sense called the feelings


I did not invent the idea of God either. I cannot take anything away from it or to add anything to it. 

When an idea is sheerly invented, the inventor is free to fiddle with it. My idea of God is a natural unit that does not invite or even permit such interference. 

The only remaining alternative is that my idea of God is innate in me, just as the idea of myself is innate in me.

This is likely because God created and placed this idea in me to serve as a craftsman's mark stamped on his work<!--  (not that he needed any mark other than the work itself) --> <!-- But the mere fact that God created me is a good reason for thinking that I am somehow made in his image and likeness, and that I perceive that likeness in the same way that I perceive myself.  -->

<!-- When I turn my mind’s eye upon myself, I understand that --> I am a thing that is incomplete and dependent on something else. That something aspires without limit to ever greater and better things. 

<!-- ; but I also understand at the same time that he on whom I depend has within him all those greater things, and hence that he is God. The core of the argument is this= --> 

I could never exist with an innate idea of God if <!-- the nature that I have – that is, containing within me the idea of God – if --> God did not really exist. ‘God’ means the idea of:
- the very being who is within me
- the one who has no defects and has all those perfections<!--  that I can’t grasp but can somehow touch with my thought. -->

It shows that he cannot possibly be a deceiver, since the natural light makes it clear that all fraud and deception depend on some defect.

<!-- But before examining this point more carefully and investigating other truths that may be derived from it, I want to pause here and spend some time contemplating God; to reflect on his attributes and to gaze with wonder and adoration on the beauty of this immense light, so far as the eye of my darkened intellect can bear it.

For just as we believe through faith that the supreme happiness of the next life consists in contemplating the divine majesty, so experience tells us that this same contemplation, though much less perfect, provides the greatest joy we can have in this life.
