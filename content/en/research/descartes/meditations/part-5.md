What are God’s attributes?

What is the nature of my mind?

<!--  I may take these up at some time; but right now I have a more pressing task. Now that I have seen how to reach the truth – what to do and what to avoid – I must try to escape from the doubts that beset me a few days ago, and see whether anything can be known for certain about material objects. -->

<!-- Before enquiring into whether there are any such things, I should consider the ideas of them in my thought, in order to see which of those ideas are distinct and which confused.

I distinctly imagine quantity – that is, the length, breadth and depth of the quantity, or rather of the thing that is quantified. I also enumerate the thing’s parts, to which I attribute various sizes, shapes, positions and movements; and to the movements I attribute various durations, that is, I say how long each movement lasts.

Size, shape, position and so on are well known and transparent to me as general kinds of phenomenon, but there are also countless particular facts involving them that I perceive when I attend to them. The truths about all these matters are so open to me, and so much in harmony with my nature, that when I first discover any of them it feels less like learning something new than like remembering something I had known before, or noticing for the first time something that was already in my mind without my having turned my mental gaze onto it. -->

<!-- The most important point is that --> I find in myself countless ideas of things that are not nothing, even if they do not exist outside me. 

Such ideas have <!-- For although I am free to think of these ideas or not, as I choose, I didn’t invent them= they have --> their own true and immutable natures, which are not under my control. 

Even if there are not and never were any triangles outside my thought, still, when I imagine a triangle I am constrained in how I do this, because there is a determinate nature or essence or form of triangle that is eternal, unchanging, and independent of my mind.


The triangle has properties not invented by me, such as:
- its three angles equal 180 degrees
- its longest side is opposite its greatest angle
- etc
<!-- . , even if I didn’t give them a thought when the triangle first came into my mind. So they can’t have been . -->

<!-- It does not help to point out that I have sometimes seen triangular bodies, so that the idea of the triangle might have come to me from them through my sense organs. I can prove truths about the properties not only of triangles but of countless other shapes that I know I have never encountered through the senses.  -->

<!-- These properties must be something, not pure nothing= whatever is true is something; and these properties are true because I am clearly aware of them. (I have already proved that everything of which I am clearly aware is true; and even if I hadn’t proved it, my mind is so constituted that I have to assent to these geometrical propositions as long as I perceive them.) 

I remember, too, that even back in the times when the objects of the senses held my attention, I regarded the clearly apprehended propositions of pure mathematics – including arithmetic and geometry – as the most certain of all. -->

These lead to this conclusion: The fact that I have an idea of x which has a property that I perceive means that x <!-- , and clearly and distinctly perceive x to have a certain property, it follows that x --> really does have that property. 

I can use this <!-- not turn this to account in a second argument --> to prove God's existence.

I have an idea of God. <!--  (that is, of a supremely perfect being) is certainly one that I find within me,--> just as I have ideas of shapes and numbers. <!-- and I understand from this idea that it belongs to God’s nature that he always exists. This understanding is just as clear and distinct as what is involved in mathematical proofs of the properties of shapes and numbers. -->

<!-- So even if I have sometimes gone wrong in my meditations in these past days, I ought still to regard -->

Thus, the existence of God is as certain as the truths of mathematics are. 

<!-- At first sight, this looks like a trick. Where things other than God are involved, I have been accustomed to distinguish a thing’s existence from its essence. The question ‘What is the essence of triangles (or flames or sparrows)?’ asks what it takes for something to qualify as a triangle (or flame or sparrow). -->

<!-- Answering this still leaves open the existence question, which asks whether there are any triangles (or flames or sparrows). I can easily believe that in the case of God, also, existence can be separated from essence, letting us answer the essence question about God while leaving the existence question open, so that God can be thought of as not existing. 

But on more careful reflection it becomes quite evident that, just as having-internal-angles-equal-to-180? can’t be separated from the idea or essence of a triangle, and as the idea of highlands can’t be separated from the idea of lowlands, so existence can’t be separated from the essence of God.  -->

It is self-contradictory to think of highlands in a world where there are no lowlands. So it is self-contradictory to think of a perfect God as lacking <!--  as not existing – that is, to think of a supremely perfect being as lacking a perfection, namely --> the perfection of existence.

<!-- Here is a possible objection to the preceding two paragraphs=  -->

This is objected by saying that I tie God to existence just as a river is tied to riverbanks. The world has riverbanks and it is possible to have a world without rivers. 

So why must existence have a God?

<!-- I can’t think of God except as existing, just as I can’t think of a river without banks. From the latter fact, though, it certainly doesn’t follow that there are any rivers in the world; so why should it follow from the former fact that God exists?  -->

<!-- How things are in reality is not settled by my thought; and just as  -->

I can imagine a winged horse even if it does not exist in reality. Likewise, I can imagine <!-- though no horse has wings, so I can attach --> God existing in my thought even if no God exists. But this is false reasoning. 

I simply mean that God and existence are inseparable, just as river and riverbanks – whether or not there are any in reality – are inseparable.

<!-- From the fact that I can’t think of a river without banks, it does not follow that a river with banks exists anywhere, but simply that   -->

But I do not mean that existence led to the idea of God. Rather, it is the idea of God that led to existence. <!-- On the other hand, from the fact that I can’t think of God except as existing it follows that  --> Since God and existence are inseparable, it follows that God really exists. I am unable to think of an existence without a God. <!-- My thought doesn’t make it so. It doesn’t create necessities. The influence runs the opposite way= the necessity of the thing constrains how I can think, depriving me of the freedom to think of God without existence (that is, a supremely perfect being without a supreme perfection), like my freedom to imagine a horse with or without wings. -->

A person can object that since God has all the perfections, and since existence is one of those perfections, then God is not an essential part of existence.<!--   is , but that my original supposition was not necessary; -->

<!-- just as it is not necessary to think that all quadrilateral figures can be inscribed in the circle, since, if I supposed this, I should be constrained to admit that the rhombus, being a figure of four sides, can be therein inscribed, which, however, is manifestly false. --> 

This objection is incompetent. 

<!-- ; for although it may not be necessary that I shall at any time entertain the notion of Deity, yet each time I happen to think of a first and sovereign being, and to draw, so to speak,  -->

Whenever I think of God, <!-- the idea of him from my memory, --> I necessarily attribute to him all kinds of perfections that I can remember.

<!-- This necessity is sufficient, as soon as I discover that  -->

Existence is a perfection. This is enought to cause me to infer the existence of God<!--  this first and sovereign being; --> just as it is not necessary that I should ever imagine any triangle, but whenever I am desirous of considering a rectilinear figure composed of only three angles, it is absolutely necessary to attribute those properties to it from which it is correctly inferred that its three angles are not greater than two right angles, although perhaps I may not then advert to this relation in particular. 

But when I consider what figures are capable of being inscribed in the circle, it is by no means necessary to hold that all quadrilateral figures are of this number; on the contrary, I cannot even imagine such to be the case, so long as I shall be unwilling to accept in thought aught that I do not clearly and distinctly conceive; and consequently there is a vast difference between false suppositions, as is the one in question, and the true ideas that were born with me, the first and chief of which is the idea of God. 

This idea is not just from me. It is an idea which <!--  factitious depending simply on my thought, but that it is the --> representats a true and immutable nature. This is because:

1. I can conceive no other being, except God, to whose essence existence [necessarily] pertains
2. It is impossible to conceive two or more gods of this kind

If a second God exists, then he must have existed from all eternity<!-- , and will exist to all eternity; and finally, because I apprehend many other properties in God, none of which I can either diminish or change -->.

<!-- But, indeed, whatever mode of probation I in the end adopt, it always returns to this, that it is  -->

Only the things I clearly conceive can have the power of completely persuading me. 

Some objects are obvious to everyone. Other objects are only discovered after careful investigation. After they are once discovered, the latter are not esteemed less certain than the former.

For example, it is not immediately obvious that the square of the base of a right-angled triangle is equal to the squares of the other two sides. But after this is realized, we are  firmly persuaded of its truth<!--  of the former as of the latter -->. 

Likewise,  it is not immediately obvious that God exists. This is because of the<!--  espect to God if I were not pre-occupied by prejudices, and my thought beset on all sides by the --> continual presence of<!--  the images of  --> sensible objects. But after I realize that God exists, it is easy for me to see it as the truth. <!--  I should know nothing sooner or more easily then the fact of his being. 

For is there any truth more clear than the existence of a Supreme Being, or of God, seeing it is to his essence alone that [necessary and eternal] existence pertains? -->

<!-- The correct conception of this truth has cost me much close thinking. Nevertheless, at present I feel not only as assured of it as of what I deem most certain, but I remark further that  -->

The certitude of all other truths  absolutely depend on it that without this knowledge it is impossible ever to know anything perfectly.

For although I am of such a nature as to be unable, while I possess a very clear and distinct apprehension of a matter, to resist the conviction of its truth, 

yet because my constitution is also such as to incapacitate me from keeping my mind continually fixed on the same object and as I frequently recollect a past judgment without at the same time being able to recall the grounds of it, it may happen meanwhile that other reasons are presented to me which would readily cause me to change my opinion, if I did not know that God existed. 

I only have vague and vacillating opinions, not true and certain knowledge. 

For example, geometry teaches that a triangle has 3 angles totaling 180 degrees. I might forget this fact when my memory fails and call it as false. 

<!--  and I find it impossible to believe otherwise, while I apply my mind to the demonstration;  -->

<!-- Even if but as soon as I cease from attending to the process of proof, although I still remember that I had a clear comprehension of it, yet I may readily come to doubt of the truth demonstrated, if I do not know that there is a God,

I might think that I am deceived, even in matters which I think I apprehend with the greatest evidence and certitude, especially when I recollect that I frequently considered many things to be true and certain which other reasons afterward constrained me to reckon as wholly false. -->


I have discovered that:
- God exists
- all things depend on him
- he is no deceiver
- what I clearly and distinctly perceive is necessarily true


although I no longer attend to the grounds of a judgment, no opposite reason can be alleged sufficient to lead me to doubt of its truth, provided only I remember that 1 once possessed a clear and distinct comprehension of it. 

My knowledge of it thus becomes true and certain. 

This same knowledge extends likewise to whatever I remember to have formerly demonstrated, as the truths of geometry and the like for what can be alleged against them to lead me to doubt of them ? 

<!-- Will it be that my nature is such that I may be frequently deceived? But I already know that I cannot be deceived in judgments of the grounds of which I possess a clear knowledge. Will it be that I formerly deemed things to be true and certain which I afterward discovered to be false ?  -->

<!-- But I had no clear and distinct knowledge of any of those things, and, being as yet ignorant of the rule by which I am assured of the truth of a judgment, I was led to give my assent to them on grounds which I afterward discovered were less strong than at the time I imagined them to be. -->

<!-- What further objection, then, is there ? Will it be said that perhaps I am dreaming (an objection I lately myself raised), or that all the thoughts of which I am now conscious have no more truth than the reveries of my dreams ? But although, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that all which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true. -->

Thus, the certainty and truth of all knowledge depends strictly on my awareness of the true God. 

<!-- So much so that until I became aware of him I couldn’t perfectly know anything. Now I can achieve full and certain knowledge of countless matters, both concerning God himself and other things whose nature is intellectual, and also concerning the whole of that corporeal nature that is the subject-matter of pure mathematics. -->
