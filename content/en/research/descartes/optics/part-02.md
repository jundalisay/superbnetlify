How can we determine this refraction quantitatively?

<!--  and since the comparison I have just used [between the refraction of light and the penetration of a cloth by a tennis ball] enables this to be understood easily, I believe it is appropriate that I explain it here and now, and so as to make it easier to understand, I shall speak first about
reflection.  -->

Suppose a ball is struck from A towards B. At B it meets the surface of the ground CBE, which prevents it from going further and causes it to be deflected.


Where will it go?

The ground is perfectly flat and hard.

The ball always travels at a constant speed, both when it descends and rebounds upwards.

<!-- , and let us
ignore entirely the question of the power that continues to move it when
it is no longer in contact with the racquet, as well as any effect of its
weight, bulk, or shape. For we are not concerned here to examine it
closely, and none of these things has a bearing on the action of light, which
is what should concern us.  -->

The power which can make the motion of this ball continue is different from that which determines it to move in one direction rather than another. 

This can be seen readily from the fact that the motion of the ball depends on the force with which the racquet has impelled it. This same force could have made it move in any other direction just as easily as toward B. Whereas it is the position of the racquet that determines it to tend towards B, and which could have determined it to tend there in the same way.

even if a different force had moved it. This already shows that it is not impossible for this ball to be deflected by its impact with the ground, and
hence that there could be a change in its determination to tend toward without any change in the force of its movement, since these are two
different things. 

And as a result, we must not imagine, as many of our Philosophers do, that it is necessary for the ball to stop for a moment at
point  before being reflected toward ; for if its motion were to be interrupted by its being stopped momentarily, there is nothing that would
cause it to begin again. Moreover, we should note that not only the determination to move in a particular direction but also the motion itself, and
in general any sort of quantity, can be divided into all the parts of which
we can imagine it to be composed; and we can readily conceive that the
determination of the ball to move from  toward  is composed of two
others, one of which makes it descend from line  to line , and at the
same time the other makes it go from the left, , toward the right, , so
that the two joined together direct it to  along the line . And then it is
easy to understand that its impact with the ground can prevent only one
of these determinations, and not the other in any way. For it must
certainly prevent the one that made the ball descend from  to , for it
occupies all the space below . But why should it prevent the other,
which made the ball move to the right, seeing that it does not offer any
opposition at all to the determination in that direction? In order to discover in exactly what direction the ball must rebound, let us describe a
circle with centre  passing through point , and let us say that in as much
time as the ball will take to move from  to , it inevitably returns from 

to a certain point on the circumference of this circle, inasmuch as all the points which are the same distance away from  as  is can be found on
this circumference, and inasmuch as we assume the movement of this ball to be always of a constant speed. Next, in order to determine precisely the
point on the circumference to which the ball must return, let us draw 3 straight lines, , and  perpendicular to , so that the distance
between  and  is neither greater nor less than that between  and .

Let us say that in the same amount of time as the ball took to move
toward the right side from  – one of the points on the line  – to  – one
of those on the line  – it must also advance from the line  to some
point on ; for any point of this line  is as distant from  in this direction as is any other, as are those on the line ; and the ball has as much
determination to move to that side as it had before. Thus the ball cannot
arrive simultaneously both at some point on the line  and at some point
on the circumference of the circle , unless this point is either  or ,
as these are the only two points where the circumference and the line
intersect; and, accordingly, since the ground prevents the ball from passing toward , we must of necessity conclude that it inevitably passes
toward . And so it is easy for you to see how reflection occurs, namely at
an angle always equal to the one we call the angle of incidence; in the same
way that, if a ray coming from point  descends to point  on the surface
of a flat mirror , it is reflected toward  in such a way that the angle of
reflection  is neither greater nor smaller than the angle of incidence
.
Let us come now to refraction. And first let us suppose that a ball
impelled from  toward  encounters at point , no longer the surface of
the earth, but a cloth , which is so thin and finely woven that this ball
has the force to rupture it and pass through it, losing only some of its
speed: half, for example. Now given this, in order to know what path it
must follow, let us consider that its motion is completely different from
its determination to move in one direction rather than another, from
which it follows that the amounts of these two must be examined
separately. And let us also take into account that, of the two parts of which
we can imagine this determination to be composed, only the one making
the ball tend downwards can be changed in any way as a result of its
collision with the cloth, while that making the ball tend to the right must
always remain the same as it was, because the cloth offers no resistance to
it. Then, having described the circle  with its centre at  [fig. ], and
The World and Other Writings



having drawn at right angles to  the three straight lines , ,  so
that the distance between  and  is twice that between  and , we
shall see that the ball must tend toward point . For since it loses half its
speed in passing through the cloth , it must take twice the time to
descend from  to some point on the circumference of the circle  as it
took to go from  to  above the cloth. And since it loses none of the determination it had to move to the right, in twice as much time as it took to
pass from the line  to  it must cover twice the distance in the same
direction, and consequently it must arrive at a point on the straight line
 at the same instant as it reaches a point on the circumference of the
circle . This would be impossible were it not going toward , as this is
the only point below cloth  where the circle  and the straight line
 intersect.
Now suppose that the ball coming from  toward  does not strike a
cloth at point , but rather a body of water, whose surface slows it by half,
as did the cloth. Everything else being as before, I say that this ball must
pass from  in a straight line, not toward , but toward . For, in the first
place, the surface of the water must certainly deflect it there in the same
way as did the cloth, seeing that it takes the same amount of force from
the ball, and that it offers opposition to the ball in the same direction.
Then as for the rest of the body of water which fills the space between 
and , although it may resist the ball more or less than did the air which
we previously supposed to be there, this does not mean that it must deflect
it more or less. For the water can open up to make way for the ball just as

easily in one direction as in another, at least if we always assume, as we do,
that neither the heaviness or lightness of this ball, nor its bulk, nor its
shape, nor any other such extraneous cause changes its course. And it may
be noted here that the deflection of the ball by the surface of the water or
the cloth is greater, depending on how obliquely it enters, so that if it
meets it at a right angle, as when it is impelled from  toward , it must
go on in a straight line toward  without any deflection. But if it is
impelled along a line such as  [fig. ], which is so sharply inclined
to the surface of the water or cloth  that the line , being drawn
as before, does not cut the circle  at all, the ball should not penetrate
it at all, but rebound from its surface  toward the air , in the same
way as if it had encountered the earth there. Some have occasionally
experienced this with regret when, firing artillery pieces toward the
bottom of a river for their amusement, they have wounded those on the
other shore.
But let us make another assumption here, and consider that the ball,
having first been impelled from  toward , is impelled again at point 
by the racquet , which increases the force of its motion, say by a third,
so that afterwards it can progress as much in two moments as it previously
did in three. This will have the same effect as if the ball were to meet at
point  a body of such a nature that it could pass through its surface 
one-third again more easily than through the air [fig. ]. And it follows
clearly from what has already been demonstrated that if we describe the
circle  as before, and the lines , ,  in such a way that there is a
third less distance between  and  than between  and , then point
, where the straight line  and the circular one  intersect, will indicate
the place toward which this ball, when it is at point , must be deflected.

Now we can also draw the converse of this conclusion and say that since
the ball which comes in a straight line from  to  is deflected at  and
moves from there toward point , this means that the force or facility with
which it penetrates the body  is to that with which it leaves the body
 as the distance between  and  is to that between  and , that
is, as the line  is to .
Finally, inasmuch as the action of light follows in this respect the same
laws as the movement of the ball, it must be stated that when its rays pass
obliquely from one transparent body to another which receives them
more or less easily than the first, they are deflected in such a way that they
are always less inclined to the surface of these bodies on the side of the
one that receives them most easily than on the side of the other; and this
exactly in proportion to the facility with which the one rather than the
other receives them. Only it has to be carefully noted that this inclination
must be measured by the size of the straight lines –  or ,  or , and
the like – in comparison to one another, not by that of angles such as 
or , and still less by that of angles such as , which we call ‘angles of
refraction’. For the ratio or proportion between these angles varies with
all the different inclinations of the rays; whereas that between the lines 
and  or other similar ones, remains the same in all refractions caused by
the same bodies. Thus, for example [fig. ], if a ray passing through the
air from  to  meets the surface of the lens  at point  and is deflected
toward  in this lens, and if another ray coming from  toward  is
deflected toward , and another coming from  is deflected toward , there
must be the same ratio between the lines  and , or  and , as

Discourse  of the Dioptrics

Fig. 
between  and ; but not the same ratio between the angles  and
, or  and , as between  and .
So now you see how refractions have to be measured; and although we
must refer to observation to determine their quantity, in so far as it
depends on the nature of the particular body where they occur, we nevertheless are able to do so with sufficient certainty and facility, since they
are all thereby reduced to a common measure. For it is enough to
examine a single ray among them to discover all the refractions occurring
at a single surface, and we can avoid any error if, in addition, we examine
those of several other rays. Thus, if we wish to determine the amount of
refraction that occurs at the surface  separating the air  from the
lens , we need only determine the refraction of the ray  by examining the proportion between lines  and . Then, if we suspect we have
made a mistake in this observation, we must determine the refraction in
several other rays like  or ; and if we find the same proportion
between and , and between  and , as between  and , we shall
have no further cause to doubt the truth of our observation.
You will, perhaps, be surprised, in carrying out these observations, to
find that light rays are more sharply inclined in air than in water, on the
surfaces where their refraction occurs, and still more so in water than in
glass: which is just the opposite of the ball, which is inclined more sharply
in water than in air, and which cannot pass through glass at all. For
example, if it is a ball that is impelled through the air from  toward 
[fig. ], meeting a surface of water  at point , it will be deflected from
 toward ; yet in the case of a ray, it will, on the contrary, pass from 
toward . However, you shall cease to find this strange when you consider

the nature that I ascribed to light, when I said it is nothing but a certain
movement or an action received in the very subtle matter that fills the
pores of other bodies; and you should bear in mind that, as a ball loses
much more of its agitation in falling against a soft body than against a hard
one and rolls less easily on a carpet than on a completely bare table, so the
action of this subtle matter can be impeded much more by the parts of the
air – which, being as it were soft and badly joined, do not offer it much
resistance – than by those of water, which offer it much more; and still
more by those of water than by those of glass or crystal. Thus, to the
degree that the tiny parts of a transparent body are harder and firmer, the
more easily they allow the light to pass; for the light does not have to drive
any of them from their places, as a ball must expel those of water if it is to
find a passage through them.
Moreover, knowing thus the cause of the refractions that occur in water
and glass, and generally in all the other transparent bodies around us, we
can note that they must be just the same when the rays are leaving the
bodies and when they are entering them. So, if a ray coming from 
toward  is deflected from  toward  in passing from the air into a lens,
the one that returns from  toward  must also be deflected from  toward
. Nevertheless, other bodies can be found, especially in the sky, where
the refractions, proceeding from other causes, are not reciprocal in this
way. And certain cases can also be found in which the rays must be
curved, even though they pass through only one transparent body, in the
same way that the motion of a ball is often curved because it is deflected
in one direction by its weight and in another by the action with which we
have impelled it, or for various other reasons. For in the final analysis, I
dare to say that the three comparisons that I have just used are so fitting

Discourse  of the Dioptrics

Fig. 
that all the particular features that may be observed in them correspond
to particular features which prove to be entirely similar in the case of
light; but I have tried to explain only those that have the greatest bearing
on my subject. And I do not wish to have you consider anything else here,
except that the surfaces of transparent bodies that are curved deflect the
rays passing through each of their points in the same way as would the flat
surfaces that we can imagine touching these bodies at the same points. So,
for example, the refractions of the rays , ,  [fig. ], which come
from the flame  and fall on the curved surface of the crystal ball , must
be regarded in the same way as if  fell on the flat surface ,  on ,
and  on , and likewise for the others. From which you can see that
these rays may be variously collected or dispersed, depending on the
different curvatures of the surfaces on which they fall

<!-- 

Especially since we shall need hereafter to know exactly the quantity of this refraction, and since it can quite conveniently be understood by the comparison which I have just used, I believe it is apropos that I mark here to explain it all at once, and that I speak first of reflection, in order to make it all the easier to understand. Let us therefore think that a ball being pushed from A towards B[6] encounters at point B the surface of the earth CBE, which, preventing it from passing further, causes it to turn away; and let's see which way.

---

But in order not to encumber ourselves with new difficulties, let us suppose that the earth is perfectly flat and hard, and that the ball always goes of equal speed, as much in descending as in ascending, without inquiring in any way about the power which continues to move it, after it is no longer touched by the racket, nor consider any effect of its weight, nor of its size, nor of its shape; 

For there is no question here of looking at it so closely, and there is none of these things which take place in the action of light, to which this must be referred. Only it should be noted that the power, such as it is, which causes the movement of this ball to continue is different from that which determines it to move rather towards one side than towards another, just as it is very easy to to know that it is the force on which it has been pushed by the racket, on which its movement depends, and that this same force could have made it move towards any other side as easily as towards B; whereas it is the situation of this racket which determines it to tend towards B, and which could have determined it there in the same way, even if another force would have moved it; which already shows that it is not impossible for this ball to be deflected by the encounter with the earth, and so that the determination it had to tend towards B is changed, without there being anything for that changed to the force of its motion, since these are two different things, and therefore one must not imagine that it is necessary for it to stop for any moment at the point B before returning to F, as well as do many of our philosophers: for, if its movement were once interrupted by this arrest, there would be found no cause which would make it begin again afterwards. Further, it must be remarked that the determination to move towards some side can as well as the movement, and generally as any other kind of quantity, be divided into all the parts of which it can be imagined to be composed, and that one can easily imagine that that of the ball which moves from A towards B is composed of two others, one of which makes it descend from the line AF towards the line CE, and the other at the same time makes it go from the left AC to the right FE, so that these two joined together lead it to B along the straight line AB, And then it is easy to understand that the meeting of the earth can only prevent one of these two determinations, and not the other in any way: for it must indeed prevent the one which caused the ball to descend from AF towards CE, because it occupies all the space which is below CE; but why should she prevent the other who made her advance towards the right hand, seeing that she is in no way opposed to him in that sense? In order to find therefore precisely towards which side this ball must return, let us describe a circle from the center B, which passes through the point A, and let us say that in as much time as it will have taken to move from A to B, it must infallibly return from B to some point on the circumference of this circle, especially since all the points which are as distant from this one B, as is A, are in this circumference, and that we suppose the movement of this ball always be equally fast. Then, in order to know precisely to which of all the points of this circumference it must return, let us draw three straight lines AC, HB and FE, perpendicular to CE, and in such a way that there is neither more nor less distance between AC and HB, than between HB and FE; and say that in as much time as the ball took to advance towards the right side, from A one of the points of the line AC, to B one of those of the line HB, it must also to advance from the line HB to some point on the line FE: for all the points of this line FE are as far from HB in this direction as each other, and as much as those of the line AC , and she is as determined to move towards that side as she was before. But is it that it cannot arrive at the same time at some point on the line FE and together at some point on the circumference of the circle AFD, if not at the point D or at the point F, especially since there are only these two where they intersect each other, so that the earth preventing it from passing towards D it must be concluded that it must go infallibly towards F. And so you easily see how the reflection takes place, namely according to an angle always equal to that which is called the angle of incidence; as if a ray coming from point A falls at point B on the surface of the flat mirror CBE, it is reflected towards F, so that the angle of the reflection FBE is no longer less than that of the incidence ABC.

---

Let us now come to refraction; and first suppose that a ball pushed from A[7] towards B encounters at point B, no longer the surface of the earth, but a web CBE, which is so weak and loose that this ball has the force to break it and pass through it, losing only part of its speed, namely, for example, half. Now, this having been established, in order to know what path it must follow, let us again consider that its movement differs entirely from its determination to move rather towards one side than towards another, whence it follows that their quantity must be examined separately; and let us also consider that of the two parts of which one can imagine this determination to be composed, it is only that which caused the ball to stretch from top to bottom which can be changed in some way by the meeting of the web, and that for the one that made it tend towards the right hand, it must always remain the same as it was, because this canvas is in no way opposed to it in this sense. Then having described the circle AFD from the center B, and drawn

---

at right angles on CBE the three straight lines AC, HB, FE, such that there is twice as much distance between FE and HB as between HB and AC, we will see that this ball must tend towards point I ; for, since it loses half its speed in crossing the web CBE, it must take twice as much time to pass under it from B to some point on the circumference of the circle AFD which it has made above to come from A to B: and, since it loses none of the determination it had to advance to the right in twice as much time as it took to pass from the line AC up to HB, it must make twice as much distance towards this same side, and consequently arrive at some point on the straight line FE, at the same instant as it also arrives at some point on the circumference of the circle AFD; which would be impossible if it did not go towards I, especially since it is the only point below the canvas CBE where the circle AFD and the straight line FE intersect.

Let us now think that the ball which comes from A towards D encounters at point B, no longer a canvas, but water, the surface of which CBE deprives it of precisely half of its speed as this canvas did; and the rest posed as before, I say that this ball must pass from B in a straight line, not towards D, but towards I: for first it is certain that the surface of the water must divert it towards there in the same way as the canvas, since it deprives him just as much of his strength, and is opposed to him in the same sense. Then for the rest of the body of water which fills all the space which is from B to I, although it resists it more or less than did the air which we previously supposed there, it is not to say for that that he must more or less deflect it: for he can open himself to make it pass just as easily towards one side as towards another; at least if we always suppose as we do that neither the weight or lightness of this ball, nor its size, nor its shape, nor any other such extraneous cause, changes its course;


---

and we can here notice that it is all the more deflected by the surface of the water or the canvas, the more obliquely it meets it; so that if it meets it at right angles, as when it is pushed from H[8] towards B, it must pass in a straight line towards G, without turning away at all; but if it is pushed along a line like AB, which is so steeply inclined on the surface of the water or the canvas CBE, that the line FE being drawn as before does not intersect the circle AD, this ball must in no way to penetrate, but to rebound from its surface B towards the air L, just as if it had encountered earth there. What we have sometimes experienced with regret, when, for pleasure, firing artillery pieces towards the bottom of a river, we have injured those who were on the other side on the shore.


---

But here let us make yet another supposition and suppose that the ball, having been pushed from A[9] towards B, is pushed again, being at point B, by the racket CBE, which increases the force of its movement, for example, d a third, so that it can afterwards make as much distance in two moments as it did in three before, which will have the same effect as if it encountered at point B a body of such nature that it passed through its surface area CBE by one-third more easily than by air. And it obviously follows from what has already been demonstrated that, if we describe the circle AD as in front, and the lines AG, HB, FE, in such a way that there is a third less distance without FE and HB that between HB and AC, the point I, or the straight line FE and the circular AD intersect, will designate the place towards which this ball, being at point B, must be diverted.

Now we can also take the reverse of this conclusion, and say that, since the ball which comes from A in a straight line as far as B turns away being at point B and takes its course from there towards I, this means that the force or the ease with which it enters the body CBEI is with that with which it leaves the body ACBE, as the distance which is between AC and HB with that which is between HB and FI, that is to say as the line CB is with BE .

---

Finally, especially since the action of light follows in this the same laws as the movement of this ball, it must be said that, when its rays pass obliquely from one transparent body into another, which receives them more or less easily than the first, they are diverted there in such a way that they are always less inclined on the surface of these bodies on the side where is that which receives them most easily than on the side where is the other; and it is precisely in proportion to the fact that he receives them more easily than the other does. Only it is necessary to take care that this inclination must be measured by the quantity of the straight lines, like CB or AH, and EB or IG, and similar, compared ones with the others; not by that of the angles, such as ABH or GBI, nor much less by that of the similar to DBI, which are called the angles of refraction; for the ratio or proportion which is between these angles varies at all the different inclinations of the rays, whereas that which is between the lines AH and IG, or similar, remains the same in all the refractions which are caused by the same bodies. As, for example, if a ray passes through the air from A[10] to B,

which, meeting the surface of the CBR glass at point B, turns towards I in this glass, and there comes another from K to B which turns away towards L, and another from P towards R which turns away towards S , there must be the same proportion between the lines KM and LN, as between AH and IG; but not the same between the angles RBM and LBN, as between ABH and IBG.

So that you now see in what way refractions must be measured; and even that, to determine their quantity as it depends on the particular nature of the bodies in which they are made, it is necessary to come to experience, one cannot fail to be able to do it quite certainly and easily from that they are thus all reduced to the same measure; for it suffices to examine them in a single ray to know all those which are made in the same area, and we can avoid all error, if we examine them in addition to that in a few others. As if we want to know the quantity of those which are made in the surface CBR, which separates the air AK from the glass LI, we have only to test it in that of the radius ABI, by seeking the proportion which is between lines AH and IG. Then, if we are afraid of having failed in this experiment, we must still test it in some other rays, like KBL; and, finding the same proportion of KM to LN, as of AH to IG, we shall no longer have any occasion to doubt the truth.


---

But perhaps you will be surprised, in making these experiments, to find that the rays of light bend more in air than in water, on the surfaces where their refraction takes place; and even more in water than in glass, quite the contrary of a ball, which tilts more in water than in air, and can in no way pass through glass: for, for example, if it is a ball which, being pushed in the air from A[11] towards B, meets at point B the surface of the water CBE, it will turn away from B towards V; and if it is a ray, it will go quite the contrary from B towards I. What you will however cease to find strange, if you remember the nature which I attributed to light, when I said that it was nothing else than a certain movement or an action received in a very subtle matter, which fills the pores of other bodies; and that you consider that, as a ball loses more of its agitation by hitting a soft body than against a hard one, and that it rolls less easily on a carpet than on a bare table, so the action of this subtle matter can be hindered much more by the parts of the air, which being soft and badly joined together, do not give it much resistance, than by those of the water, which give it more; and even more by those of water than by those of glass or crystal: so that as much as the small parts of a transparent body are harder and firmer, so much the more do they allow light to pass through. easily, for this light must not drive any out of their places, just as a bullet must drive out those of water to find passage among them.

Moreover, knowing thus the cause of the refractions which take place in water and in glass, and commonly in all the other transparent bodies which are around us, we can remark that they must all be similar when the rays come out. of these bodies and when they enter them: as if the ray which comes from A towards B is diverted from B towards I while passing from the air in the glass, that which will return from I towards B must also be diverted from B towards A However, other bodies may well be found, chiefly in the sky, where the refractions, proceeding from other causes, are not so reciprocal. And there may also be certain cases in which the rays must bend even though they only pass through a single transparent body; as the motion of a ball often bends, because it is deflected to one side by its weight, and to another by the action by which it has been pushed, or for various other reasons; for, finally, I dare to say that the three comparisons which I have just used are so specific that all the particularities which can be observed in them relate to a few others which are all similar in light; but I only tried to explain those which were most relevant to me, and I do not want you to consider anything else here, except that the surfaces of transparent bodies which are curved divert the rays which pass through each of their points, in the same way as would make the flat surfaces which one can imagine touching these bodies at the same points: as, for example, the refraction of the rays AB[12], AC, AD, which, coming from the torch A, fall on the curved surface of the crystal ball BCD, must be considered in the same way as if AB fell on the flat surface EBF, and AC on GCH, and AD on IDK, and so on the others; whence you see that these rays can be assembled or separated differently, according as they fall on surfaces which are curved differently.

And it is time that I begin to describe to you what is the structure of the eye, in order to be able to make you understand how the rays which enter it arrange themselves there to cause the feeling of sight. -->
