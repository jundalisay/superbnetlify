{{< s v="1" >}} We cannot think too highly of the works of God.

<!-- Having now ascertained certain principles of material things, which were sought, not by the prejudices of the senses, but by the light of reason, and which thus possess so great evidence that we cannot doubt of their truth, it remains for us to consider whether from these alone we can deduce the  -->

Can we explain all the phenomena of nature from the principles of material things? 

We will begin with the most general phenomena on which the others depend -- the general structure of this visible world.

But first we must consider 2 things:

1. We should ever bear in mind the infinity of the power and goodness of God

In this way, we avoid the mistake of imagining his works to be too great, beautiful, and perfect. Instead, we must not put limits to those which we have no certain knowledge. This will prevent us from thinking less highly of the power of God.


{{< s v="2">}} We should not think too highly of ourselves. 

2. We think too highly of ourselves if we put certain limits to the world, without being assured of their existence either:
- by natural reasons or
- by divine revelation.
<!-- beware lest, in our presumption, we imagine that the ends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the world are understood by us. -->

<!-- The second is, that we should beware of presum too highly of ourselves, as it seems we should do if we supposed , as if -->

Putting limits on the world will make the power of our thought extend beyond what God has made in reality.

It will lead us to believe that:
- all things were created by God for us only.
- our intellect could comprehend the ends which God proposed to himself in creating the universe.

{{< s v="3" >}} How were all things were created for the sake of man?


Morally, it may be pious to believe that God made all things for us,. It can incite us to be more thankful and loving towards him.

It is even in some sense true, because we can imagine using anything in existence. This will lead us to believe that all things were created for us.

 <!-- there is no created thing of which we cannot make some use, if it be only that of exercising our mind in considering it, and honouring God on account of it, it is yet by no means probable that  in this way that God had no other end in their creation. -->

But this supposition would be plainly ridiculous and inept in physical reasoning because there are many things that exist that we cannot see or know, and were not useful to us.
 <!-- , for we do not doubt but that many things exist, or formerly existed and have now ceased to be, which were never seen or known by man, and were never of use to him. -->
