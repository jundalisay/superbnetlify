{{< s v="57" >}} Some attributes exist in the things to which they are attributed, and others only in our thought. What are duration and time?

Of these attributes or modes, there are some which exist in the things themselves, and others that have only an existence in our thought.

For example, time is the general, which we distinguish from duration taken in its generality, and call the measure of motion,

Time is only a certain mode under which we think duration itself. 

We do not conceive the duration of moving things to be different from the duration of non-moving things.

For example, 2 bodies are in motion for 1 hour. `Body A` is moving quickly. `Body B` is moving slowly.

One body does not have more time than the other, although there may be much more motion in one of the bodies than in the other. 

But the "duration" of all things we put under a common measure and compare with that of the greatest and most regular motions that give rise to years and days, and which we call "time".

Hence, "time" is but a mode of thinking. It is not superadded to duration, taken in its generality.


{{< s v="58" >}} Number and all universals are only modes of thought.

In the same way number, when it is not considered as in created things, but merely in the abstract or in general, is only a mode of thinking; and the same is true of all those general ideas we call universals.


{{< s v="59" >}} How are universals formed? What are the 5 common universals?

1. Genus
2. Species
3. Difference
4. Property
5. Accident

Universals arise merely from our making use of one and the same idea in thinking of all individual objects between which there subsists a certain likeness. 

When we comprehend all the objects represented by this idea under one name, this term likewise becomes universal.

For example, when we see 2 stones, and do not regard their nature farther than to remark that there are two of them, we form the idea of `2`, which we call the binary.

When we afterwards see 2 birds or 2 trees, and merely take notice of them so far as to observe that there are 2 of them, we again take up the same idea as before. This 2 thus becomes universal.

We likewise give to this number the same universal name of "binary". 

In the same way, when we consider a shape of 3 sides, we form an idea which we call the idea of a triangle. We afterwards use it as the universal to represent to our mind all other shapes of 3 sides. 

But when we remark more particularly that of shapes of 3 sides, some have a right angle and others not, we form the universal idea of a right-angled triangle. This is called "species" relative to the universal. 

The right angle is the universal difference by which right-angled triangles are distinguished from all others.

The square of the side which sustains the right angle is equal to the squares of the other two sides. 

This property belongs only to this species of triangles, we may call it the "universal property of the species". 

Finally, if we suppose that of these triangles some are moved and others not, this will be their universal accident; and, accordingly, we commonly reckon five universals, viz., genus, species, difference, property, accident.


{{< s v="60" >}}  Distinctions and first of the real.

But number in things themselves arises from the distinction there is between them. 

Distinction is threefold:

1. Real
2. Modal
3. Of reason

The "real" subsists between two or more substances. It assures us that 2 substances are really mutually distinct, if only we are able clearly and distinctly to conceive the one of them without the other. 

Our knowledge of God makes it certain that he can effect all our distinct ideas.

For example, we have the idea of an extended and corporeal substance. We may not be sure if that substance really exists. 

**Nevertheless, we may be assured that it may exist merely because we have the idea of it.**

If it really exists, that every part which we can determine by thought must be really distinct from the other parts of the same substance.

In the same way, since everyone is conscious that he thinks, and that he in thought can exclude from himself every other substance, whether thinking or extended, it is certain that each of us thus considered is really distinct from every other thinking and corporeal substance. 

God united bodies to souls so closely and intimately as a composite whole. 
<!-- that it was impossible to form a more  union, and thus made ,  -->
- Yet these 2 substances would remain really distinct, despite this union.
<!-- ; for with whatever tie God connected them,  -->
- God was not able to remove his own power of separating them, or of conserving the one apart from the other.
- The things which God can separate or conserve separately are really distinct.


{{< s v="61" >}} The 2 kinds of modal distinction

1. That between the mode properly so-called and the substance of which it is a mode

An example is that we can clearly apprehend substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it. 

On the other hand, we cannot conceive this mode without conceiving the substance itself. There is, for example, a modal distinction between figure or motion and corporeal substance in which both exist; there is a similar distinction between affirmation or recollection and the mind. 

2. That between two modes of the same substance. 

An example is our ability to recognise the one of two modes apart from the other, as shape is different from motion, and motion is different from shape. 

We cannot think of either the one or the other without thinking of the common substance in which they adhere.

If, for example, a stone is moved, and is withal square, we can, indeed, conceive its square figure without its motion, and reciprocally its motion without its square figure; but we can conceive neither this motion nor this figure apart from the substance of the stone.

As for the distinction according to which the mode of one substance is different from another substance, or from the mode of another substance, as the motion of one body is different from another body or from the mind, or as motion is different from doubt, it seems to me that it should be called real rather than modal, because these modes cannot be clearly conceived apart from the really distinct substances of which they are the modes.
