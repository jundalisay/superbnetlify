{{< s v="202" >}} The philosophy of Democritus is not less different from ours than from the common. 

[Footnote: "that of Aristotle or the others."]

But Democritus also supposed certain corpuscles that were of various shapes, sizes, and motions, from the heaping together and mutual concourse of which all sensible bodies arose.

Nevertheless, his mode of philosophizing is commonly rejected by all. 

I reply that the philosophy of Democritus was never rejected by anyone, because he allowed the existence of bodies smaller than those we perceive, and attributed to them diverse sizes, figures, and motions, for no one can doubt that there are in reality such, as we have already shown; 

The philosophy of Democritus was rejected because:

1. He supposed that these corpuscles were indivisible.
   - I also reject this

2. He imagined there was a vacuum about them
   - I show that this is impossible

3. He attributed gravity to these bodies, of which I deny the existence in any body, in so far as a body is considered by itself, because it is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion which several bodies bear to each other

4. He did not explain how all things arose from the concourse of corpuscles alone

<!-- I leave it to others to determine whether the philosophy I profess possesses a valid coherency, [and whether on its principles we can make the requisite number of deductions; and, inasmuch as the consideration of figure, magnitude, and motion has been admitted by Aristotle and by all the others, as well as by Democritus, and since I reject all that the latter has supposed, with this single exception, while I reject generally all that has been supposed by the others, it is plain that this mode of philosophizing has no more affinity with that of Democritus than of any other particular sect]. -->


{{< s v="203" >}} How we may arrive at the knowledge of the figures, [magnitudes], and motions of the insensible particles of bodies.

I assign determinate figures, magnitudes, and motions to the insensible particles of bodies, as if I had seen them.

I admit that they do not fall under the senses. How could I have known them?

I reply that I first considered in general all the clear and distinct notions of material things that are to be found in our understanding, and that, finding no others except those of figures, magnitudes, and motions, and of the rules according to which these three things can be diversified by each other, which rules are the principles of geometry and mechanics, I judged that all the knowledge man can have of nature must of necessity be drawn from this source; because all the other notions we have of sensible things, as confused and obscure, can be of no avail in affording us the knowledge of anything out of ourselves, but must serve rather to impede it]. 

Thereupon, taking as my ground of inference the simplest and best known of the principles that have been implanted in our minds by nature, I considered the chief differences that could possibly subsist between the magnitudes, and figures, and situations of bodies insensible on account of their smallness alone, and what sensible effects could be produced by their various modes of coming into contact.

Afterwards, when I found like effects in the bodies that we perceive by our senses, I judged that they could have been thus produced, especially since no other mode of explaining them could be devised.

In this matter the example of several bodies made by art was of great service to me: for I recognize no difference between these and natural bodies beyond this, that the effects of machines depend for the most part on the agency of certain instruments, which, as they must bear some proportion to the hands of those who make them, are always so large that their figures and motions can be seen; in place of which, the effects of natural bodies almost always depend upon certain organs so minute as to escape our senses. 

All the rules of mechanics belong also to physics, of which it is a part or species, [so that all that is artificial is withal natural]: for it is not less natural for a clock, made of the requisite number of wheels, to mark the hours, than for a tree, which has sprung from this or that seed, to produce the fruit peculiar to it. 

Accordingly, just as those who are familiar with automata, when they are informed of the use of a machine, and see some of its parts, easily infer from these the way in which the others, that are not seen by them, are made; so from considering the sensible effects and parts of natural bodies, I have essayed to determine the character of their causes and insensible parts.


{{< s v="204" >}} Touching the things which our senses do not perceive, it is sufficient to explain how they can be, [and that this is all that Aristotle has essayed].

But here some one will perhaps reply, that although 

I have supposed causes which could produce all natural objects. But we should not conclude that they were produced by these causes.

An artisan can make 2 clocks that are both accurate and have the same outward appearance, even if their internal mechanism is different. 

 <!-- which, though they both equally well indicate the time, and are not different in outward appearance, have nevertheless nothing resembling in the composition of their wheels; so doubtless  -->

Likewise, the Supreme Maker of things has an infinity of diverse means at his disposal to make all the existing things that we see. But it is impossible for the human mind to know which of all these means he chose to employ.

  <!-- by each of which he could have made all the things of this world to appear as we see them, without it being possible for  -->


I most freely concede this. 

I believe that I have done all that was required, if the causes I have assigned are such that their effects accurately correspond to all the phenomena of nature, without determining whether it is by these or by others that they are actually produced.

And it will be sufficient for the use of life to know the causes thus imagined, for medicine, mechanics, and in general all the arts to which the knowledge of physics is of service, have for their end only those effects that are sensible, and that are accordingly to be reckoned among the phenomena of nature. 

[Footnote: "have for their end only to apply certain sensible bodies to each other in such a way that, in the course of natural causes, certain sensible effects may be produced; and we will be able to accomplish this quite as well by considering the series of certain causes thus imagined, although false, as if they were the true, since this series is supposed similar as far as regards sensible effects."-French.]

<!-- And lest it should be supposed that Aristotle did, or professed to do, anything more than this, it ought to be remembered that he himself expressly says, at the commencement of the seventh chapter of the first book of the  -->

In Book 1 Chapter 7 of Meteorologies, Aristotle adduces sufficient reasons and demonstrations of things which are not manifest to the senses. 


 <!-- them, if he only shows that they may be such as he explains them. [Footnote: words in Greek] -->


{{< s v="205" >}} Nevertheless there is a moral certainty that all the things of this world are such as has been here shown they may be.

But nevertheless, that I may not wrong the truth by supposing it less certain than it is, I will here distinguish two kinds of certitude. The first is called moral, that is, a certainty sufficient for the conduct of life, though, if we look to the absolute power of God, what is morally certain may be false. 

[Thus, those who never visited Rome do not doubt that it is a city of Italy, though it might be that all from whom they got their information were deceived].

If anyone, wishing to decipher a letter written in Latin characters that are not placed in regular order, bethinks himself of reading a B wherever an A is found, and a C wherever there is a B, and thus of substituting in place of each letter the one which follows it in the order of the alphabet, and if by this means he finds that there are certain Latin words composed of these, he will not doubt that the true meaning of the writing is contained in these words, although he may discover this only by conjecture, and although it is possible that the writer of it did not arrange the letters on this principle of alphabetical order, but on some other, and thus concealed another meaning in it: for this is so improbable [especially when the cipher contains a number of words] as to seem incredible. But they who observe how many things regarding the magnet, fire, and the fabric of the whole world, are here deduced from a very small number of principles, though they deemed that I had taken them up at random and without grounds, will yet perhaps acknowledge that it could hardly happen that so many things should cohere if these principles were false.


{{< s v="206" >}} We possess even more than a moral certainty of it.

There are some, even among natural, things which we judge to be absolutely certain. [Absolute certainty arises when we judge that it is impossible a thing can be otherwise than as we think it].

This certainty is founded on the metaphysical ground, that, as 

God is supremely good and the source of all truth.
- He gave us the faculty of distinguishing truth from error.
- This faculty cannot be fallacious so long as we:
  - use it correctly
  - distinctly perceive anything by it.

Of this character are:
- the demonstrations of mathematics
- the knowledge that material things exist
- the clear reasonings that are formed regarding them. 

My results in this treatise will perhaps be admitted as part of the class of truths that are absolutely certain.
- This will happen if it they are deduced in a continuous series from the first and most elementary principles of human knowledge
- This is if people understand that we can only perceive external objects if they cause some local motion in our nerves.

Such motion cannot be caused by the fixed stars unless those stars produce a motion in our nerves and in the whole heavens between them and us.

<!-- This is because of their great distance from us,  -->


<!-- for these points being admitted, all the others, at least the more  -->

Remove those stars, then my general doctrines regarding the world or earth [e. g., the fluidity of the heavens, Part 3, Section 46] are the only explanations of the phenomena they present.

<!-- ## 207. I submit all my opinions to the authority of the church.

Nevertheless, lest I should presume too far, I affirm nothing, but submit all these my opinions to the authority of the church and the judgment of the more sage; and I desire no one to believe anything I may have said, unless he is constrained to admit it by the force and evidence of reason. -->
