{{< s v="4.163" >}} Why is steel more suitable for receiving it than lighter iron?

Steel receives this force greater than the lighter iron, because it has more and more perfect passages, suitable for receiving the striated particles. 

And he should plant it more constantly, because the ends of the branches which protrude in those passages are less flexible.


{{< s v="4.164" >}} Why is it communicated to him by a more perfect magnet than by a less perfect one?

The greater is communicated to it by a greater and more perfect magnet: also because the striated particles, rushing with greater force into its passages, bend the extremities of the branches prominent in them more; and also, because many rushing towards it at the same time, many such passages open to themselves. 

For it is to be noted that there are more such passages in steel, which of course consists of only iron rams, than in a magnet, in which there is a great deal of stony material, to which the iron rams are embedded; and therefore, when only a few striated particles enter a weak iron magnet, they do not open all its passages, but only a few, and indeed those which were closed by the extremities of the twigs which were as flexible as possible.


{{< s v="4.165" >}} Why does the earth itself give a magnetic force to iron?

All iron, in which, the ends of these twigs are very flexible, can receive from the Earth itself, a very great magnet, but a very weak one,  in a very short time.

If it is oblong, not yet imbued with any such oil, and one of its extremity is inclined towards the Earth, it will directly acquire from this ground, in that extremity inclined towards the Earth, as the South Pole in these Boreal regions; and in a moment it will lose it, and acquire the very opposite, if the same extremity be raised, and the opposite be depressed.


{{< s v="4.166" >}} Why is the magnetic field weaker in the Earth than in small magnets?

I do not think that it is weaker. Rather it is much stronger in that middle region of the Earth, than it has been said above that the whole is covered with striated particles. 

These striated particles, having come forth from it, are for the most part returned through that inner crust of the upper region of the Earth, from which metals arise, and in which there are also many passages suitable for receiving them. 

Therefore very few have come down to us. For I judge that these passages, both in that interior crust, and also in the magnets and iron rams, which are contained in the veins of this exterior, are entirely different from the passages of the middle region; they flow to Borea, and are returned from Borea to the South through all the upper parts, but [&] especially through its inner crust, and likewise through the magnets and iron of the exterior; and when the greater part of them have consigned themselves, a few remain which through this air of ours, and other surrounding bodies, destitute of suitable paths, seek a way for themselves.

Which, if I guess rightly, the magnet being cut out of the earth, and placed freely in a boat upon the water, that same face which always before, while it clung to the earth, looked upon the North, must still turn towards the North: as Gilbertus, the principal investigator of the magnetic virtue, He is the first to discover it on Earth, and he claims to have experienced it. Nor do I care that others think they have seen the contrary; for perhaps he imposed upon them that since that very part of the earth, from which they had taken care to cut the magnet, was a magnet, the poles of the cut magnet should turn towards it: as was said a little before, a fragment of one magnet is turned to another.


{{< s v="4.167" >}} Why do needles, touched by a magnet, always have the poles of their virtue at their extremities?

This magnetic power is not shared with an oblong iron, except according to its length.

This is why the needle itself, when it is impregnated, must always:
- turn its extremities towards the same parts of the earth, towards which the spherical magnet turns its poles; and always having such needles of their magnetic virtue precisely at these extremities.


{{< s v="4.168" >}} Why the poles of the magnetic force are not always accurately directed towards the poles of the Earth, but are sometimes deflected from them.

Their ends can be more easily distinguished from other parts than the poles of the magnet, it has been noted with their help that the poles of the magnetic virtue do not everywhere accurately reflect the poles of the Earth, but deviate from them in various places. 

The cause of the decline of which, as Gilbertus has already observed, must be referred to the only inequalities which exist on the surface of the earth.

In some parts of this outer earth, much more iron rods and more magnets are found /301/ than in others. and thus they often deviate from their journeys. And since the turning of the poles of a magnet, or of the ends of a needle, depends upon the course of these particles alone, it must follow all their inflections. 

An experiment of this matter may be made in a magnet whose shape is not spherical: for if a small needle be placed above its different parts, it will not always turn in exactly the same way to its poles, but will often deviate somewhat from them. 

Nor is it to be thought that there is a disparate reason in it, that the inequalities which are in the outermost surface of the earth, compared to its whole mass, are very small; for they are not to be compared with it, but with needles and magnets in which there is a deviation, and thus it appears that they are quite large.


{{< s v="4.169" >}} Why even sometimes this declination changes with time.

There are those who say that this decline does not always remain the same in the same parts of the earth, but changes with time. This should not be seen as surprising: not only because iron is daily transferred from one part of the earth to another by men, but also because its lumps, which are in this outer earth, can be corrupted in some places with time, and others can be generated in others, either by the interior of the earth was subdued.
