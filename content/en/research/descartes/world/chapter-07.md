How could Nature untangle the confusion of the chaos after creation? What are the laws of nature that God has imposed on her?

<!-- Know, then, first that by "nature" I do not here mean some deity or other sort of imaginary power. Rather, I use that word to signify matter itself, insofar as I consider it taken together with all the qualities that I have attributed to it, and under the condition that God continues to preserve it in the same way that He created it. 

For from that alone (i.e. that He continues thus to preserve it) it follows of necessity that there may be many changes in its parts that cannot, it seems to me, be properly attributed to the action of God (because that action does not change) and hence are to be attributed to nature.  -->

God created the "laws of nature" which determine how changes take place in the universe. 

<!-- To understand this better, recall that, among the qualities of matter, we have supposed that its parts have had  -->

Matter:
- has naturally diverse motions since the beginning when they were created, 
- touches one another on all sides, without any void in between
- they collide with each other when they move. 

<!-- . Whence it follows of necessity that from then on, in beginning to move, they also began to change and diversify their motions by colliding with one another. Thus, if God preserves them thereafter in the same way that He created them, He does not preserve them in the same state. That is to say, with God always acting in the same way and consequently always producing the same effect in substance, there occur, as by accident, many diversities in that effect. And it is easy to believe that God, who, as everyone must know, is immutable, always acts in the same way. Without, however, involving myself any further in these metaphysical considerations, I will set out here two or three of the principal rules according to which one must think God to cause the nature of this new world to act and which will suffice, I believe, for you to know all the others.[31] -->

## Rule 1: State Continuity

![Rule 1](/covers/rule1.jpg)

Rule 1: A body always continues in the same state unless a collision with others causes it to change that state.

For example:
- if a part has some size, it will never become smaller unless others divide it.
- if it is round or square, it will never change that shape without others forcing it to do so
- if it is stopped in some place, it will never depart from that place unless others chase it away
- if it begins to move, it will always continue with an equal force until others stop or retard it

We all observe this rule <!-- in the old world --> with respect to size, shape, rest, and a thousand other like things. But the philosophers have exempted motion from it. But motion is exactly what I want to add, without intending to contradict them. 

However, the motion of that philosophers speak of <!--  which they speak --> is so very different from that which I am explaining.  <!-- conceive that it can easily happen that what is true of the one is not true of the other. -->

They themselves admit that the nature of their motion is very little understood[32]. They try to explain motion as:

{{< q a="Aristotle" >}}
motus est actus entis in potentia, prout in potentia est [33]
<cite>Aristotle, Physics, III</cite>
{{< /q >}}


These words are so obscure that <!--  I am constrained to leave them here in their language, because --> I cannot interpret them from Latin. 

(The words "motion is the act of a being in potency, insofar as it is in potency," are no clearer in [English].) 

On the contrary, the nature of the motion of which I speak of can be known by geometers <!-- themselves, who among all men studied most to conceive very distinctly the things they were considering, judged it simpler and more intelligible than --> from their surfaces and their lines.
- A point's motion forms a line.
- A line's motion forms a surface.<!--  a  So it appears from the fact that they explained the line by the motion of a point, and the surface by that of a line. -->

The philosophers also suppose several motions that happen without the body changing place, such as:
- "motus ad formam" or motion with respect to form
- "motus ad calorem" or motion with respect to heat
- "motus ad quantitatem" or motion with respect to quantity
- and myriad others

My 'motion', on the other hand, refers to the lines of geometers. It is the [physical, linear] motion taken by bodies passing from one place to another, successively occupying all the spaces in between.

The philosophers:
- say that rest is nothing but the privation of motion
- give so much solidity and reality to even the smallest motion, compared to rest

 <!-- attribute to the least of these motions a being much more solid and real than they do to rest, which they say is .  -->

My 'rest' is also a quality of matter while it remains in one place, just as motion is its quality while it is changing place.[34]

The motion explained by philosophers has a strange nature. 
- Other things have perfection and preservation as their goal.
- But the goal of the motion of philosophers is to achieve rest, contrary to all the laws of nature
  - Motion strives on its own to destroy itself. 

By contrast, my 'motion' follows the same laws of nature as do all the qualities found in matter, as well those which the philosophers call modos et entia rationis cum fundamento in re (modes and beings of thought with foundation in the thing) as qualitates reales (their real qualities). I cannot find reality in this<!--  is   than in the others -->.



## Rule 2: Motion Transfer

![Rule 2](/covers/rule2.jpg)

Rule 2: When Body A pushes Body B, A gives to B the motion that it has lost at the same time. B can only take as much motion from A that B absorbs from A.

The combination of Rule 1 and 2 is seen in body B starting or stopping to move by being pushed or stopped by Body A. 

Why does a stone continue to move after being thrown? Why does it not continue to move always? 

This is because of air resistance. The wind whistles when the stone divides the air. If we move our hand in the air, we feel <!-- in the air a fan or some other very light and very extended body, one will even be able to feel by the weight of one's hand that --> the air impeding its motion. <!-- , far from continuing it -->

Rule 1 might persuade us that the more an opposing body can resist, the more it can stop the motion of others. But with this Rule, a person will have trouble explaining:
- why the stone's motion is weakened more in colliding with a soft body of middling resistance than when it collides with a harder one that resists it more. 
- why, as soon as it has made a little effort against the latter, it spontaneously turns on its heels rather than stopping or interrupting the motion it has. 
<!-- But Rule 2 says that  -->

This is solved by Rule 2. 

It teaches us that Body A's motion is not retarded by a collision with Body B in proportion to how much Body B resists Body A, but only in proportion to:
- how much Body B's resistance is surmounted, and
- according to how much force it receives from Body A's motion, that Body A loses.[35]

<!-- Now, even though in most of the motions we see in the true world we cannot perceive that the bodies that begin or cease to move are pushed or stopped by some others, we do not thereby have reason to judge that these two rules are not being observed exactly.  -->

Even if <!-- in most of the motions that we see in the true world, --> we cannot perceive that the bodies in the aethereal world that begin or cease to move are pushed or stopped by some others, it does not mean that these two rules are not being observed exactly. 

Those bodies can often receive their agitation from the aethereal air and fire which are always among them without being perceptible, or even from the grosser air, which also cannot be perceived. 

We also cannot perceive the agitation that is transferred, sometimes to that grosser air, and sometimes to the Earth dispersed therein.
<!-- They can transfer the agitation, sometimes to that grosser air and sometimes to the whole mass of the earth; dispersed therein, it also cannot be perceived. -->

But, even if all that our senses have ever experienced in the true world seemed manifestly contrary to what is contained in these two rules, the reasoning that has taught them to me seems to me so strong that I would not cease to believe myself obliged to suppose them in the aethereal world. 

<!-- But, even if all that our senses have ever experienced in the true world seemed manifestly contrary to what is contained in these two rules, the reasoning that has taught them to me seems to me so strong that I would not cease to believe myself obliged to suppose them in the aethereal world.  -->

<!-- For what more firm and solid foundation could one find to establish a truth (even if one wanted to choose it at will) than to take the very firmity and immutability that is in God?[36] -->

Those two rules follow from this alone= God is immutable, acting always in the same way, always producing the same effect. 

He placed a certain quantity of motions in all matter in general when He first created it. One must either avow that He always conserves as many of them there or not believe that He always acts in the same way. 

From that first instant, the parts of matter, in which these motions are found unequally dispersed began to retain them or to transfer them from one to another according as they had the force to do, one must of necessity think that He causes them always to continue the same thing. And that is what those two rules contain.


## Rule 3: Angular Momentum -- Curved or Rotating Contraint, Straight Freedom

![Rule 3](/covers/rule3.jpg)

A moving body always travels along a curved line in totality, even if its individual parts seem to travel in a straight line. Thus, a body's total or long-term motion is different from its individual or short-term motion.

For example, the parts of a wheel revolve around their axle. If you set those parts free from the axle, then they will break loose and travel in a straight line. Thus, the individual motion of the parts of the wheel is different from the motion of the wheel. 

<!-- For example, if a wheel is turned on its axle, its parts go around because they are linked to one another. Nevertheless, their inclination is to go straight. As soon as it is free, its motion ceases to be circular and continues in a straight line. -->

<!--  ahead, as appears clearly if perchance one of them is detached from the others. For, --> 

In the same way, when one whirls a stone in a sling, it:
- it presses against the middle of the sling and causes the cord to stretch while it is in the sling, 
- goes straight out as soon as it leaves the sling

It always goes in a straight line. It goes around only under constraint.

This rule, like Rule 1 and 2, is based on God conserving everything by His continuous influence. <!-- action and, c --> Consequently, this means that He is conserving it anew at every instant and not as a mere continuation of the past conservation.   <!-- not as it may have been some time earlier, but precisely as it is at the same instant that He conserves it. --> 

### Straight-Line "Free" Motion

Of all motions, only the straight motion is entirely simple. Its whole nature is understood in an instant. We only need to think:
- that a body is moving in a certain direction and
- that that direction happens* <!-- is the case --> in each instant while it is moving<!--  during its the time that it is moving.  -->

> *Superphysics Note: Like Einstein, Descartes splits movements into small observable instants (moments of time). Like Einstein, he unifies the conservation of energy and mass as a single idea. But unlike Einstein who sources this conservation on a spacetime fabric, Descartes asribes it to God through His aether. This aether is the material of the mind which is inherent in all objects, though it is most evident in living things. Therefore, the cause of movement is the differences in the inherent nature of each mind. The 'mind' of an ice block moves as water when influenced by heat. An object that has no mind will not react to anything and will never move. Such an object does not exist. 



### Curved "Constrained" Motion= Cartesian Relativity 

By contrast, a circular motion or any other motion requires us to at least think of:
<!-- two of its instants or  --> 
- two of its [past] parts, and
- the relation between them.
<!-- [37] -->

The sophists might say here that <!-- the linear motion occurs instantly --> those parts are linear and not curved. [Thus, curves are still made up of straight lines and therefore every motion is a straight line.]
<!-- But, so that the philosophers (or rather the sophists) do not find occasion here to exercise their superfluous subtleties, note that I do not thereby say that  rectilinear motion can take place in an instant.-->

But this is not totally correct. 

A correct interpretation is that the cause of all motion is to be found in the bodies in each instant. This cause is revealed <!-- I only say that all that is required to produce it is found in bodies in each instant that might be determined --> while they are moving. Not all causes <!-- , and not all that is required to --> produce circular motion.


For example, suppose a stone is moving in a sling along the circle marked AB.

![AB curve](/graphics/physics/abc.png)

- You perceive its movement at the instant when it arrives at point A
- It is in the act of moving towards C. Its action is directed in that direction in that instant. The difference is that the movement towards C is in a straight line<!--  show linear even if you can find nothing there that makes its motion circular -->. 
<!-- [38] -->



Thus, if the stone begins to leave the sling, **God will continue to preserve it as it is at that moment** [when it <!-- decided to leave --> left the sling]. He will not preserve it with the old inclination to go along the curve AB. Instead, He will preserve its inclination to go straight ahead toward point C.

According to this rule:
- God alone is the author of all the motions in the world <!-- , insofar as they exist and insofar as they are straight, --> 
- But it is the diverse dispositions of matter that render the motions irregular and curved 

This is why the theologians teach that:
- God is also the author of all our actions<!-- , insofar as they exist and insofar as they have some goodness, --> 
- But the diverse dispositions of our wills render those actions evil

I could go on and add more rules for all the motions of Nature. <!-- set out here many additional rules for determining in detail when and how and by how much the motion of each body can be diverted and increased or decreased by colliding with others, something that comprises summarily all the effects of nature.[39] --> 

But these are the three that will be supported by the mathematicians and evidence. 

<!-- I shall be content with showing you that, besides the three laws that I have explained, I wish to suppose no others but those that most certainly follow from the eternal truths on which the mathematicians are wont to support their most certain and most evident demonstrations;  -->
<!-- the truths, I say, according to which God Himself has taught us  -->

God disposed all things in number, weight, and measure*.

> *Translator's note: Sapientia, 8, 21. The statement was a commonplace of medieval thought and was encountered by every schoolboy in the opening line of Johannes de Sacrobosco's Algorismus vulgaris, the standard arithmetic textbook from the mid-13th-mid-16th century.



The knowledge of those laws is so natural to our souls that we take them for granted and we even assume that those laws would apply in all the universes that He created. <!--   cannot but judge them infallible when we conceive them distinctly, nor doubt that, if --> <!-- God had created many worlds, the laws would be as true in all of them as in this one.  -->

Thus, those who can examine <!-- sufficiently --> the consequences of these truths and of our rules will be able to know their effects. <!--  by their causes and (to explain myself in the language of the School) --> They will be able to demonstrate *a priori* everything that can be produced in that <!-- new world --> aethereal world.

<!-- And so there will be no exception that impedes this, we will add, if you wish, to our suppositions that God will never mark any  the new world and that  -->

This means that if God did a miracle in that aethereal world, then the laws of nature in this world would change as well.

<!-- the intelligences, or the rational souls, which we might hereafter suppose to be there, will in no way disturb the ordinary course of nature. -->

I cannot give evidence of all these assertions. But these open a path for you to find them yourselves. 

<!-- Nonetheless, in consequence of this, I do not promise you to set out here exact demonstrations of all the things I will say. It will be enough for me to open to you the path by which you will be able to find them yourselves, whenever you take the trouble to look for them.  -->

Most minds lose interest when one makes things too easy for them. This is why I must employ both shadow and bright colors. 
<!-- Thus I will be content to pursue the description I have begun, as if having no other design than to tell you a fable. -->
