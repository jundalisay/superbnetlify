The philosophers assure us that above the clouds there is an aethereal air much subtler than ours. 

That air is not composed of vapors of the earth, but is an element in itself. Above this air there is another, much subtler body, which they call the element of fire.


These two elements are mixed with liquids and solids of <!-- water and earth in the composition of --> all the inferior bodies. This aethereal air and fire fill the in-between spaces* among the parts of the real air that we breathe. These bodies, interlaced with one another, then compose a real solid mass.

> *Superphysics Note= The previous chapter explained that the aether had bodies within it. This chapter explains what those bodies are, as aethereal air and aethereal fire


<!-- But, in order better to make you understand my thought on this subject, and so that you will not think I want to force you to believe all the philosophers tell us about the elements, I should describe them to you in my fashion. -->


## Athereal Fire

My idea is that the first element is an aethereal fire. It is the most subtle and penetrating fluid in the universe. As a liquid, its parts are smaller and move much faster than those of other bodies. 

This aethereal fire has no determinate size or shape. 

Or rather, in order not to be forced to admit any void in nature, I do not attribute to this first element parts having any.

The impetuosity of their motion causes them to be divided by collision with other bodies. Its parts:
- change shape at every moment to accommodate themselves to the shape of the places they enter
- can go into any passage regardless of narrowness
- can penetrate the and fill the gaps in other bodies easily

<!-- , nor an angle so small, among the parts of other bodies, where the parts of this element do not penetrate without any difficulty and which they do not fill exactly.[20] -->


## Athereal  Air

The second element is aethereal air. It is also a very subtle fluid compared to the third. But compared to fire, it has some size and shape to each of its parts. They are all round and joined together like grains of sand or dust. 

Thus, they cannot arrange themselves so well, nor so press against one another that there do not always remain around them many small intervals into which it is much easier for the first element to slide than for the parts of the second to change shape expressly in order to fill them. 

This air cannot be so pure anywhere. There is always some fire with it.



## Athereal Earth

The third and last element is aethereal earth. Its parts are much larger and move as much less swiftly compared to air as those of air are slower than those of fire. 

It is one or more large masses, of which the parts have very little or no motion that might cause them to change position with respect to one another.

I do not use the qualities called "heat," "cold," "moistness," and "dryness," as do the philosophers. <!-- I shall say to you that these qualities appear to me to be themselves in need of explanation. -->

<!-- not only these four qualities, but also all the others (indeed all the forms of inanimate bodies) can be explained without the need of supposing for that purpose any other thing in their matter than the motion, size, shape, and arrangement of its parts.  -->

<!-- In consequence whereof I shall easily be able to make you understand why I do not accept any other elements than the three I have described.  -->

The difference between them and the other bodies that the philosophers call "mixed" or "composite" consists in the forms of these mixed bodies always containing in themselves some qualities that are contrary and that counteract one another, or at least do not tend to the conservation of one another, whereas the forms of the elements should be simple and not have any qualities that do not accord with one another so perfectly that each tends to the conservation of all the others.

The parts of aethereal fire move extremely fast. They are so small that no other bodies can stop them. Beyond that, they require no determinate size or shape or position. 

The parts of air have a middling motion and size. Their motion and size can be decreased or increased. Thus, they always remain balanced in that same middling condition. 

Earth has parts so large or so joined together that they have the force always to resist the motions of the other bodies.

<!-- Examine as much as you please all the forms that the diverse motions, the diverse shapes and sizes, and the different arrangement of the parts of matter can lend to mixed bodies. I am sure you will find none that does not contain in itself qualities that tend to cause it to change and, in changing, to reduce to one of the forms of the elements. -->

Flame, for example, have parts that move very fast and have some size. But they cannot last long without being corrupted. They give <!-- For either the size of its parts, in giving them --> their force to other bodies, causing their motion to reduce. 

The violence of their agitation, causes them to break upon themselves against the bodies they encounter and lose their size. 

Thus, gradually, they reduce themselves to the Earth element, or the Air, or remain as Fire.[22] 

<!-- Thereby you can see the difference between this flame, or the fire common among us, and the element of fire I have described. You should know also that  -->

The aethereal air and earth are less similar to the grosser air we breathe or to this earth on which we walk. Instead, all the bodies we see are mixed and subject to corruption.

In the universe, the elements have no places that are particularly destined for them where they can be perpetually conserved in their natural purity.[23] 

On the contrary, each part of matter always tends to be reduced to one of their forms. After being reduced, they never tend to leave that form. Hence, even if God at the beginning had created only mixed bodies, nevertheless since the world began all these bodies could have had the chance to leave their forms and to take on those of the elements. 

Thus:
- all the bodies that are large enough to be counted among the most notable parts of the universe each have the form of only one of these elements alone
- mixed bodies can only appear on the surfaces of these large bodies

There are mixed bodies that are formed from <!-- ; for, the elements being of a very contrary nature, it cannot happen that two of --> the interaction between the three elements. <!--  touch one another without acting against each other's surfaces and thus lending the matter there the diverse forms of these mixed bodies. -->

The universe only has three kinds of parts that are large enough:<!-- Apropos of this, if we consider in general all the bodies of which the universe is composed, we will find among them only three sorts that can be called large and be counted among the principal parts, to wit,  -->

1. The sun and the fixed stars as the first sort 
2. The heavens as the second
3. The earth with the planets and the comets as the third

The stars are made up of pure Fire. The heavens are made up of pure Air. Planets and comets are made up of Earth.
- I link the planets and the comets with the earth because they, like she, resist light and reflect its rays. 
- The nature of stars is totally contrary to that of planets because the action alone of their light shows that their bodies are of a very subtle and very agitated matter.
- The aethereal heavens cannot be perceived by our senses. They have a middle nature between the luminous bodies whose action we perceive and that of the solid and heavy bodies whose resistance we perceive.
- Finally, we do not perceive mixed bodies in any other place than on the surface of the earth.[24] 

<!-- And, if we consider that the whole space that contains them (i.e. all that which stretches from the highest clouds to the deepest mines that the greed of man has ever dug out to draw metals from them) is extremely small in comparison with the earth and with the immense expanses of the heavens, we will easily be able to imagine to ourselves that these mixed bodies taken all together are but as a crust engendered on top of the earth by the agitation and mixing of the matter of the heavens surrounding it. -->

Thus, the mixed bodies are not only in the air we breathe, but also in all the other composite bodies right down to the hardest rocks and the heaviest metals. 
- The latter are parts of the element of air mixed with those of earth. 
- Consequently, they are also parts of the element of fire, because they are always found in the pores of the element of air.

These three elements are mixed with one another in all bodies. Only those of the Earth element compose the bodies we see, because of their size or the difficulty they have in moving.

<!-- which () can be referred to the third element compose all the bodies we see about us.  -->

The parts of aethereal fire and air are so subtle that they cannot be perceived. One may think of all these bodies as sponges. They have many small holes always full of air or water. <!--  one nonetheless does not think that these liquids enter into its composition -->

<!-- Many other things remain for me to explain here, and I would myself be happy to add here several arguments to make my opinions more plausible. In order, however, to make the length of this discourse less boring for you, I want to wrap part of it in the cloak of a fable, in the course of which I hope that the truth will not fail to appear sufficiently and that it will be no less agreeable to see than if I were to set it forth wholly naked.
