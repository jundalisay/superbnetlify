The parts of the matter are very diverse. Most of them take the form of the fire-aether or the air-aether from breaking and dividing by collision with one another.

Nevertheless, among them are 2 sorts that had to retain the form of the earth-aether:
 <!-- third element -->

1. Those which had shapes so extended and so impeding that, when they collided with one another, it was easier for them to join together. This allows them to become larger instead of breaking up and becoming smaller. 
2. Those which began as the largest and most massive of all, could well break and shatter the others by striking them, but not be shattered themselves.

<!-- > *Superphysics note: This is now known as Quantum Entanglement -->


Whether these two were initially agitated or not, they afterwards had to move with the same agitation as the aether that contained them. <!-- matter of the heaven -->
- If they were moving faster than the aether, then they would necessarily push it upon colliding with it. In a short time, they had to transfer to the aether a part of their agitation. 
- If they were not moving, they were surrounded everywhere by the aether <!-- that matter of the heaven -->. They necessarily had to follow the aether, just as boats <!-- and diverse other bodies floating on water (both the largest and most massive and those that are less so) --> follow the water they are in. <!--  when there is nothing else to impede them from doing so.[43] -->


## Quantum Tunneling and Star Formation

Massive and solid bodies that float on water always have much more force than the water. This allows them to continue their motion, even though they get their motion from the water alone. An example are the largest and most heavily-laden boats. 

By contrast, the very light floating bodies, like those lumps of white scum floating along the shores during storms, have less force to continue moving.

If you imagine 2 rivers that join at some point and then separate again before their waters have a chance to mix. 
- Rapid, heavy boats from River `A` will will be easily able to pass into River `B`. 
- Slow, light boats from River `A` will turn away from River `B` and will be thrown back by the force of the water toward the places where it is the least rapid.

<!-- (which one must suppose to be very calm and to have a rather equal force, but also to be very rapid) ,  -->

<!-- then boats or other rather massive and heavy bodies that are borne by the course of the one river , while the lightest bodies  -->

For example, River 1 is `ABF` and River 2 is `CDG`. They come from 2 different directions and meet at `E` and then turn away from there. 

`AB` goes towards `F`. `CD` goes towards `G`.
- Boat `H` in River 1 starts from `A` towards `B` passses through `E` towards G. 
- Reciprocally, Boat `I` in River 2 starts from `C` and goes towards `F`.

If both both meet at the passage `E` at the same time, the larger and stronger boat will break the smaller and weaker. 

By contrast, lighter bodies such as leaves and feathers that float at `A` are pushed by the course of the water, not toward `E` and toward `G`, but toward `B`, where the water is less strong and rapid than at `E`. This is because at `B` it takes a curved path and not a straight line.  
<!-- its course along a line that less approaches a straight line. -->

**These light bodies, but also others heavier and more massive can join upon meeting and that, turning then with the water that bears them, several together can compose large balls such as you see at `K` and `L`.**

The more solid and larger ones with massive parts are `L`. These go toward `E`. 

The less solid and smaller ones are `K`. These go toward `B`.

<!-- , according as each is more or less solid and composed of more or less large and massive parts. -->


## The Big Bang

Wherever the parts of matter that could not take the form of the fhre-aether or the air-aether at the start, the larger and more massive among them* shortly had to run towards the outside circumference of the heavens that contained them. 

> *Superphysics note: In modern astrophysics, these are the 'hot gases'

They passed continually from one of these heavens into another* without ever stopping for a very long period of time in the same heaven.

> *Superphysics note: This is the Big Bang. The major difference is that Cartesian Big Bang has no material beginning. In fact, the expansion of space (air-aether) is totally independent of matter.  This independence from matter allows large galaxies to be formed from the 'early galaxy' which was discovered by the James Webb Telescope. In reality, the galaxies farthest from us are not earlier galaxies. 


By contrast, all the less massive had to be pushed, each toward the center of the heaven containing it, by the course of the air-aether of that heaven. 

<!-- And (given the shapes that I have attributed to them)  -->

Upon colliding with one another, they had to join together severally and compose large balls which rotated <!-- turning --> in the heavens. This rotation is affected by all the motions from the other balls. 
<!-- , have there a motion tempered by all the motions the separate parts could have if they were in fact separate.  -->

Thus some tend to move towards:
- the circumferences of those heavens
  - These are the comets
- others move toward their centers.
  - These are the planets
<!-- Those that tend to range toward the center of any heaven to be the planets, and we should take those that pass across different heavens to be comets. -->
