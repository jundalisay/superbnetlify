How can the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` advance all together towards `E` when the distance between `A` and `D` is greater than that between `F` and `G`?

This makes them enter a narrower space.
 <!-- that they must enter narrower than the space that they must leave.  -->

Their motion does not affect the air-aether on their sides [lateral from `S`].
- It only affects those that are in front of them [those farther from `S`].
- Those in front then affect those in their front, and so on. 

<!-- If so, consider that the action by which they tend to move away from the center of their heaven does not force them to touch those of their neighbors that are at the same distance as they from that center. They only touch those that are to a degree more distant from it.[58] 

Thus, the weight of the small balls `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` does not force those marked by the same numerals to touch one another. Instead, they only force those marked `1` or `10` to rest on those marked `2` or `20`. The latter would then rest on those marked `3` or `30`, and so on. 

Thus, these small balls can be arranged in many other ways.  -->

The air-aether moves separately from one another. They cannot ever be arranged like the balls in Figure 7. 

Nonetheless, it is only in that mode [of arrangement] that the proposed difficulty can obtain. 

For one could not suppose between those of its parts that are the same distance from the center of their heaven an interval so small that it would not suffice to conceive that the inclination they have to move away from that center must cause those between the lines `AF` and `DG` to advance all together toward the space E when it is void. 

Thus you see in Figure 9, compared with Figure 10, that the weight of the small balls 40, 30, etc. must cause them to fall all together toward the space occupied by that marked 50 as soon as the latter can leave it.	

<!-- And one can clearly perceive here how those of --> The balls that are marked with the same numeral are arranged in a space narrower than that which they leave, that is, by moving closer to one another. <!-- One can also perceive that --> The two balls marked 40 must fall a bit faster, and move proportionately a bit closer to one another, than the three marked 30. These three must move faster and closer to one another than the four marked 20, and so on.

Figure 10 might show that the two balls 40, 40, after having fallen slightly, come to touch one another (which is why they stop without being able to fall lower). In the very same way, the parts of the aethereal air that should advance toward E will stop before having succeeded in filling the whole space we have supposed there.

But they cannot advance toward `E` the slightest bit without it being enough to prove perfectly that since the whole space that is there is already filled by some body (whatever it might be), the parts press continually on that body and make an effort against it as if to chase it out of its place.[59]

Then, beyond that, I reply that, since their other motions, which continue in them while they are thus advancing toward E, do not permit them for a moment to remain arranged in the same way, those motions impede them from touching one another, or rather cause them, upon touching, immediately to separate again and thus not to cease for that reason to advance uninterruptedly toward the space E, until it is completely filled. 

<!-- Thus, one cannot conclude from this anything other than that  -->

The conclusion is that the force that causes them to go towards `E` is vibratory in nature.
- It increasing or relaxing in diverse small vibrations as the parts change position. 
- This is a property suited to light.

We have assumed that the spaces `E` and `S` and all the small angles between the air-aether are empty.

Now fill them with the fire-aether. 

The fire-aether in space `E` cannot impede the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` from advancing to fill it.

 <!-- in just the same way as they would if it were void, because, being extremely subtle and extremely agitated. They are always as ready to leave the places where they are as any other body might be to enter them. -->

This is why the air-aether parts of the aethreal fire that occupies the small angles between the parts of the heaven cede their place without resistance to those coming from that space E and tending to go toward the point `S`. 

I say toward `S` rather than toward any other place because the other bodies which, being more united and larger, have more force all tend to move away from it.

They pass from `E` toward `S` between the air-aether that go from `S` toward `E` without either impeding the others.

This similar to the physical air in the sandclock `XYZ` rises from `Z` towards `X` through the sand `Y` while that sand falls towards `Z`.


The fire-aether in the space `ABCD`:
- composes the body of the sun
- there turns very rapidly in a circle around `S`

These tend to move away from it in all directions in a straight line. 
- All those in line `SD` together push the part of the air-aether at point `D`
- All those in line `SA` push that which is at point `A`, and so on.

This alone can cause all the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` to advance towards the space `E`, even though they might have no inclination themselves to do so.

They must thus advance towards space `E` when it is occupied only by the fire-aether. 
- They also tend to go there even though it is filled by some other body.

Consequently, they push and make an effort against that body as if to drive it out of its place. 

Thus, if it were the eye of a man that were at the point `E`, it would actually be pushed, both:
- by the sun and
- by all the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG`.

The men of this new world will be of such a nature that, when their eyes are pushed in this manner, they will have from it a sensation very much like that which we have of light.
