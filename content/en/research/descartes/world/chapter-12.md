Thus, the weight of the parts of this Earth is caused by the motion of the stellar-air-aether in their pores.

The Moon also affects the motion of the Earth. 


![The Moon](/graphics/physics/world-11.jpg)

Assume that the moon is immobile at `B` relative to the air-aether below it.

This air-aether has less space to pass through between `O` and `6` than between `B` and `6` (if the moon does not occupy the space between `O` and `B`).

Consequently, this air-aether has to move a bit faster there.
- It must have the force to push the whole Earth a little bit toward `D`, so that its center `T` moves away a little bit 
<!-- from point `M`, which is the center of the small heaven ABCD.  -->

This is because:
- only the air-aether keeps the Earth where it is. 
- the air `5678` and the water `1234` surrounding this earth are liquid* bodies.


> *Superphysics Note: This is the water-aether or the Reactive Layer in Superphysics
<!-- For nothing but the course alone of the matter of that heaven maintains the earth in the place where it is. And, because  -->

This same force that presses the earth also make the Earth's liquids sink toward `T` from the side `6,2` and also from its opposite `8,4`
- In recompense, it causes them to rise in `5,1` and `7,3`.

The surface `EFGH` of the earth remains round because it is solid. 
- But the liquid water `1234` and air `5678` form an oval.

The earth is also turning rotating around its center.

 <!-- and by this means making the days that one divides up into 24 hours (like ours),  -->

The side `F` is now directly opposite the moon.
- This makes the water there less high.
- In 6 hours, it must be directly opposite the air-aether `C`.
  - There, this water will be higher.
- In 12 hours, it will be directly opposite `F` at `D`.
  - There, the water will be lower. 

Thus the sea, which is represented by this water `1234`, should have its ebb and flow around this earth once every 6 hours.
<!-- , just as it has about the earth we inhabit. -->

While this earth turns from `E` through `F` to `G` (from West to East), the flood of the water and the air that remains at `1` and `5` and at `3` and `7` passes from its Eastern side towards the West.
- It causes a flow without ebb very much like that which, according to the report of our pilots, makes navigation easier from the East to the West than from the West to the East.

The moon each month makes the same circuit as the Earth does each day.

Thus, it causes to advance little by little towards the East the points `1, 2, 3, 4` that mark high and low water. 

Hence, these waters do not change precisely every 6 hours, but rather lag behind by approximately 1/5 of an hour each time, as do those of our seas also.

The small heaven `ABCD` is not exactly round.
- It extends a bit more freely at `A` and at `C`
- There it moves proportionately more slowly than at `B` and `D`, where it cannot so easily break the course of the other air-aether containing it. 
<!-- the matter of the other heaven -->

Thus, the moon always remains as if attached to its exterior surface.
- It must move a bit faster and remove itself less from its path.

This is why the ebb and flow of the sea are much greater when the moon is at `B` (where it is full) and at `D` (where it is new) than when it is at `A` or at `C` (where it is only half full). 

<!-- These are peculiarities also wholly like those that the astronomers observe in the real moon, although they perhaps cannot explain them as easily by the hypotheses they use. -->

The effect of a full moon is different from a new moon because of its light. 

The other special properties of the ebb and flow of the sea depend in part on:
- the location of the seacoasts
- the prevailing winds 

The other general motions of the earth, moon, the stars, and heavens can be understood from what I have said. 
- Or they do not serve my purpose here,<!-- . ; --> not falling under the same heading as those of which I have spoken. They would take me too long to describe. 

Thus, I only have to explain this action of the heavens and the stars, as their light.
