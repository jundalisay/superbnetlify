## Spacetime Becomes Electromagnetism

The matter that came out from around the parts of the aethereal air were broken and had the small points of their angles dulled from rounding off. These necessarily had to go faster than the aethereal air. 

Along with it came a facility for dividing and changing shape at every moment in order to accommodate itself to the shape of the places where it is. 

**Thus, it took the form of the aethereal fire.**

It went faster because it had to go off to the side through very narrow passages and out of the small spaces left between the parts of the air-aether as they collided head-on. It had much more of a path than the air-aether to traverse in the same time.

The excess fire-aether needed to fill the small gaps in the round air-aether. These necessarily go around them and must draw back toward the centers around the air-aether. 
<!-- which those parts turn, -->

This is because the air-aether occupies all the other, more distant places. 
<!-- parts of the second] -->

At those centers, the remaining <!-- first element --> fire-aether must compose perfectly liquid and subtle round bodies. 


## Light Comes From Stars

These incessantly turn much faster than, and in the same direction as, the parts of air-aether surrounding them. 

The parts of the fire-aether have the force:
- to increase the agitation of those parts to which they are closest and
- in moving from the center toward the circumference, to push the parts of fire-aether in all directions, just as they push one another.

This action we perceive as light. 

<!-- We shall take one of those round bodies composed purely of the  -->
<!-- matter of the first element  -->

Assume a round body of pure fire aether to be the sun, and the others to be the fixed stars. 
<!-- , of the new world I am describing to you.  -->

The aethereal air turns around them as 'the heavens' [spacetime].
<!-- We shall take the matter of the -->
<!-- second element --> 

Imagine, that:
- the points `S`, `E`, `ε`, and `A` are the centers
- all the matter in the space `FGGF` is a heaven turning around the sun `S`
- all the matter of the space `HGGH` is another heaven turning about the star `ε`, and so on for the others. 

Thus, there are as many different aethereal heavens as there are stars. 

Since the number of stars is indefinite, so too is the number of heavens. 

**The firmament is the breadthless surface separating all the heavens from one another.**

The parts of the aethereal air toward `F`, or toward `G`, are more agitated than those toward `K` or toward `L`. 

In this way, their speed decreases little by little from the outside circumference of each heaven to a certain place (such as, for example, to the sphere `KK` around the sun, and to the sphere `LL` around the star `ε`). It then increases little by little from there to the centers of the heavens because of the agitation of the stars that are found there. 

Thus, while the parts of the aethereal air  <!-- second element  --> toward `K` have the chance to describe there a complete circle around the sun, those toward `T`, which I suppose to be 10 times closer, have not only the chance to describe 10 circles (as they would do if they moved only equally fast), but perhaps more than 30.[42]

Again, those parts toward `F`, or toward `G`, which I suppose to be 2,000-3,000 times more distant, can perhaps describe more than 60 circles. 

This is why:
- the farthest planets move more slowly than those nearest to the sun
- all the planets together move more slowly than the comets, which are more distant.

The size of each of the parts of the aethereal air is equal among all those between the outside circumference `FGGF` of the heaven and the circle `KK`.

The farthest among them are a bit smaller than the nearest (provided that one does not suppose the difference of their sizes to be proportionately greater than that of their speeds). 

By contrast, from circle `K` to the sun, it is the nearest parts that are the smallest. The difference of their sizes is proportionately greater than (or at least proportionately as great as) that of their speeds. 

Otherwise, since those nearet parts are the strongest (due to their agitation), they would go out to occupy the place of the farthest.

Note finally that, given the manner in which I have said the sun and the other fixed stars were formed, 

The sizes of the stars can be so small with respect to the heavens containing them. Even all the circles `KK`, `LL`, etc., which mark the point to which the agitation of those bodies advances the course of the matter of the air aether <!-- second element,--> can be considered merely as the points that mark the heavens' center. 

In the same way, the new astronomers consider the whole sphere of Saturn as but a point in comparison with the firmament.
