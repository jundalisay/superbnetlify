What is the weight of this physical Earth? 

The weight of the Earth is caused by the force that unites all its parts and makes them all tend toward its center, according to their:
- size and
- solidity.

This force is made up of the parts of the small heaven [air-aether] surrounding it. This external air-aether rotates faster than the air-aether inside the Earth.  

The parts of the <!-- small heaven --> aether surrounding the earth-aether turns much faster than its parts around its center. This causes them to move away from its center with more force. 

As a consequence of this outward movement, the faster external air-aether pushes the earth-aether back toward its center [to fill the air-aether that goes away from the center].



<!-- The most massive and solid bodies, such as comets, tend to move outward towards the circumferences of the system.

Only the less massive and less solid ones are pushed back toward their centers. 

Only the less solid parts of the earth could be pushed back toward its center.
- The others move away from it. 


The most solid and most massive bodies tended to move away from the center of any heaven, I supposed that they were already previously moving with the same agitation as the matter of that heaven. 

If they have not yet begun to move, or if they are moving less fast than is required to follow the course of this matter, they must at first be pushed by it toward the center about which it is turning. 

**The larger and more solid will be pushed with more force and speed.** 

Nevertheless, if they are solid and massive enough to compose comets, this does not hinder them from tending to move shortly thereafter toward the exterior circumferences of the heavens, in as much as the agitation they have acquired in descending toward any one of the heavens' centers will most certainly give them the force to pass beyond and to ascend again toward its circumference.

![The World](/graphics/physics/world-11.jpg)


The earth `EFGH` and its  water `1234` and air `5678` are a single mass.
- Its water and air are composed of the less solid of the earth's parts.

The air-aether [matter of the heaven] fills:
- all the space between the circles `ABCD` and `5678`, and
- all the small intervals below it among the parts of the air, the water, and the earth.

This air-aether and the Earth turn together around center `T`.

All their parts tend to move away from that center. 
- The air-aether outside of Earth moves away faster than the air-aether within the Earth because the former are much more agitated.

Among the parts of the Earth, those more agitated in the same direction as those of the heaven tend more to move away from the center than do the others.

"Void" means the space that is filled only with a matter that could not resist the actions of other bodies nor produce any considerable effect.

Thus, if the whole space beyond circle `ABCD` were void, then all the parts of the system in the circle `ABCD` would be the first to leave it. 
- It would be followed by those of the air
- It would then be followed by those of the water, and finally also those of the earth

Each of them would follow much sooner as it were less attached to the rest of its mass.[51] 

In the same way:
- a stone leaves a sling in which it is being moved as soon as one releases the cord
- the dust one throws on a top while it is turning immediately flies off from it in all directions.


## Gravitational Equilibrium

There is no void beyond circle `ABCD`. 

This means that the air-aether inside it has nowhere external to go unless they are displaced by the entry of other air-aether simultaneously.

<!-- 
d and where the parts of the heaven contained within that circle can go, unless at the same instant others completely like them enter in their place, 
 parts of the earth -->

Similarly, the earth-aether also cannot move away any farther from center `T` unless new earth-aether descends in their place.

 <!-- just as many parts of the heaven or other terrestrial parts as are needed to fill it.  -->
They also cannot move closer to the center unless just as many others move out from the center to be replaced. 
 <!-- rise in their stead.  -->


Thus, they are all opposed to one another. 

Each opposes:
- those that must enter in its place in the case that it should rise, and
- those that must enter therein in the case that it should descend

This is similar to how the 2 sides of a balance are opposed to one another. 

One side of a balance can be raised or lowered only if the other side does exactly the contrary at the same instant.
- The heavier side always raises the lighter
