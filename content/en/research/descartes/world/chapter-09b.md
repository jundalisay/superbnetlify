There are a few comets in the aethereal world compared to the number of heavens. 

If there were many at the beginning, over the course of time in passing across different heavens almost all of them would have to have collided with one another and broken one another up (just as I have said two boats do when they meet), so that now only the largest could remain.

When comets pass from one heaven into another, they always push before them some small bit of the matter of the heaven they are leaving and remain enveloped by it for some time until they have entered far enough within the limits of the other heaven. 

Once there, they finally loose themselves from it almost all at once and without taking perhaps more time to do so than does the sun in rising at morning on our horizon. 

In this way, they move much more slowly when they thus tend to leave some heaven than they do shortly after having entered it.

For example, the comet that takes its course along the line CDQR, has already entered rather far within the limits of the heaven FG.

Nevertheless, when it is at point C still remains enveloped by matter from the heaven FI, from which it comes, and cannot be entirely freed of that matter before it is around point D. 

But, as soon as it has arrived there, it begins to follow the course of the heaven FG and thus to move much faster than it did before. 

Then, continuing its course from there toward `R`, its motion must again slow down little by little in proportion as it approaches point `Q`, both because of the resistance of the heaven `FGH`, within the limits of which it is beginning to enter, and because, there being less distance between `S` and `D` than between `S` and `Q`, all the matter of the heaven between `S` and `D` (where the distance is smaller) moves faster there, just as we see that rivers always flow more swiftly in the places where their bed is narrower and more confined than in those where it is wider and more extended.[44]

This comet should be visible to those who live at the center of the heaven `FG` only during the time it takes to pass from `D` to `Q`, as you will soon understand more clearly when I have told you what light is. 

In the same way, you will see that its motion should appear to viewers to be much faster, its body much greater, and its light much brighter, at the beginning of the time they see it than at the end.

if you consider with some care the way in which the light that can come from the comet must spread out and be distributed in all directions in the heaven, you will also be well able to understand that, being very large (as we must suppose it to be), there can appear around it certain rays that sometimes extend in the form of a halo on all sides and sometimes gather together in the form of a tail on one side only, according to the different places from which it is viewed. m us, this comet lacks none of all the properties that have been observed up to now in those that have been seen in the real world, at least none of those properties that should be taken as true. 

In order to construct a miracle that warns of the <!-- crescent --> arrival of the Turks, some historians tell us that in the year 1450, the moon was eclipsed by a comet which passed below it. 

The astronomers attributed it to the parallax among the planets. 

<!-- , calculating badly the amount of refraction (which they do not know) of the heavens and the speed of motion of comets (which is uncertain), attribute to them enough , or even below them (where some wish to pull them as by force), then we are not obliged to believe them.[45]
