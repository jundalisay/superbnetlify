In the same way, the stone `R` has `aetheral-air-A` that is so opposed to the quantity (exactly equal in size) of the `aethereal-air-B` above it. 

![The World](/graphics/physics/world-11b.jpg)

The stone and its `aethereal-air-A` would occupy the place of that `aethereal-air-B` if the stone were to move farther away from center `T`.
- That `aetheral-air-B` would necessarily have to descend to the extent that the stone rose.

At the very same time, that rising stone and its `aethereal-air-A` will be opposed to an equal quantity of `aethereal-air-B` below it. 
- As that `aethereal-air-B` moves closer to the center `T`, that stone and its `aethereal-air-A` must descend.

 <!-- eIn the same way, that Athereal Air is also so opposed to other Athereal Airs, such as the quantity of Athereal Air below it. That upper air would occupy the lower air in the case that it were to move closer to that center. -->

<!-- This is why the stone must descend when this air rises. -->

This stone has much more of the earth-aether than air-aether of equal size. 
- Consequently, it contains much less of the air-aether.

The stone's earth-aether is less agitated and energized by the stellar air-aether than planetary air-aether is agitated by stellar air-aether.

This is why:
- the stone has no force to rise above the planetary air-aether
- the planetary air-aether has the force to make the stone fall downward

 <!-- matter of the heaven. -->
<!-- matter of the earth  -->

<!-- Its terrestrial parts are less agitated by the  than  -->

<!-- The air-aether is agitated and is energized more by its fellow air-aether than the air-aether agitates and energizes the stone made up mostly of earth-aether.
- The stone therefore should not have enough force to rise above that quantity of air-aether.  -->
<!-- matter of the heaven  -->  

<!-- This physical stone has much more earth-aether than physical air of equal size. 
- It follows that the stone has even less stellar aethereal-air -->

 <!-- terrestrial matter is contained within  than is contained in an amount of  extent.  -->

<!-- that quantity of  -->
Thus, that amount of planetary aethereal-air is 'light' when compared with the stone. 
- But it is heavy when compared with the stellar aethereal-air.
 <!-- matter of the heaven.  -->

Thus, each part of terrestrial bodies is pressed toward `T`.

Each body is pushed differently by the surrounding air-aether according to the quantity of the earth-aether that it has.
- This push depends on the amount of air-aether beneath an earth-aether that can take its place as the earth-aether goes down. 

<!--  air-aether exactly equal to the size of the part. 

That quantity, being underneath the part, can take its place in the case that the part falls.  -->

"Homogeneous" bodies are those of physical air and water. 

This is why:
- the pressure on the lowest of homogenous bodies is not notably more than the highest. 
- a man in very deep water does not feel it weigh on his back any more than if he were swimming right on top.[52]


<!--  In this way you can see that every part of terrestrial bodies is
pressed towards , not indifferently by all the matter surrounding it but
only by an amount of the matter exactly equal to the size of that part and
which, being underneath the part, can take its place if that part moves

## Why Don't We Spin Off the Earth?

The pure aether causes the stone `R` to fall toward `T` and below the air-aether surrounding it. 
- It should also cause it to go toward `6` or east, or `7` or west faster than this air-aether. 
- In this way, the stone does not fall in a straight line to the physical Earth. 
 <!-- as heavy bodies do on the real earth.  -->

But this does not happen because all the terrestrial parts in the circle `5678` is being pressed toward `T` by the stellar air aether. 

The parts of the stellar air aether have very irregular and diverse shapes.
- These must join together and compose only one mass, which is borne as a whole by the air-aether `ABCD`
<!-- course of the heaven . -->

This is why, while the whole Earth-unit turns, the planetary air-aether that are at `6` always remains opposite to those that are at `2` and at `F`.
- They only shift one way or the other due to aethereal winds* or other forces.

> *Superphysics Note: This is now proven by LIGO's detection of gravitational waves


<!-- particular causes constrain them to do so. -->
<!-- little heaven -->
The aethereal-air `ABCD` rotates much faster than the Earth.

But the aethereal-air that is caught in the pores of terrestrial bodies cannot turn notably faster than those bodies around the center `T`, even though those parts move much faster in many other directions, according to the disposition of these pores.

<!-- Even though  -->

The pure aether <!-- matter of the heaven  --> pushes the stone `R` to center `T` because the matter tends to move away from the center with more force than the stone.

Yet the matter nevertheless cannot force the stone to back up toward the West, even though the matter also tends with more force than the stone to go toward the East. 

<!-- this matter of the heaven -->

The stellar-air-aether tends to move away from the center `T` because it travels in a straight line [in outer space]. 
- It tends to move from the West towards the East only because:
  - it travels at the same speed, and
  - it is indifferent towards being at `6` or at `7`.
- It moves a bit more in a straight line while causing the stone `R` to fall toward `T` than it does in leaving the stone at `R`.

But it could not move as fast towards the East if it caused the stone to move back toward the West as it could if it left the stone in its place or even if it pushed the stone before it.


<!-- ; but
if it caused the stone to move back towards the west it would not be able
to move as quickly towards the east as it would if it left the stone where it
was, or even if it pushed the stone in front of it. -->


<!-- matter of the heaven -->

This stellar-aether-air has more force to cause this stone `R` to descend toward `T` than to cause the planetary-air-aether around the stone to descend there.

But it still does not have more force:
- to push the stone before it from the West towards the East, nor
- to cause the stone to move faster in that direction than the planetary-air-aether.

This is because there is exactly as much of this stellar-aether-air acting on the stone to cause it to fall toward `T` (and using its full force to that end) as there is earth-aether in the stone.
<!-- matter of the heaven  -->
- This means there is more earth-aether in the stone than in the air-aether of the same size. 
<!-- a quantity of air of equal extent,  -->
- This causes the stone to be pressed much more strongly toward `T` than that air-aether. 


The stone travels in the same speed whether towards the East or West because the stellar-air-aether around the stone applies its force both on the air-aether and earth-aether there [as a unit, regardless of lateral direction]. 

<!-- By contrast, to cause the stone to turn toward the orient, all the matter of the heaven contained in circle R acts on it and conjointly on all the terrestrial parts of the air that is contained in that same circle. 

Thus, there being no more acting on the stone than on this air, the stone should not turn faster than the air in that direction. -->


Many philosophers say that:
- cannonballs fired toward the West should travel much farther than if pointed toward the East
- we should always feel great winds in the air and hear great noises [in the East]

This is because they assume that the Earth is not affected by the course of the surrounding aether. 
- They think that Earth is moved by some other force 


Such arguments do not affect the motions that I am describing here. 

<!-- Note how different Descartes’ response to these standard objections to the Earth’s rotational
motion is from that of Galileo in his Two Chief World Systems. Galileo invokes a kinematic principle
of relativity of motion to account for the facts that cannon balls fired to the east and to the west
have the same range and that bodies fall vertically downwards. On Galileo’s principle, motion can
be resolved into various components, and we are only aware of those in which we do not share. So,
in the case of the fall of bodies, these actually describe a parabolic path, and this is what we would
see if we were to view the motion from an inertial frame stationary with respect to the Earth’s rotation; but because we share in the rotational motion, we are not aware of this component, only of
the downward motion, and this is what we actually see. Descartes’ account appeals to no such kinematic principle: rather, he denies that the Earth is moving in a medium (the surrounding air)
which is stationary with respect to it, and asserts that the Earth carries the medium around with
it. The air through which the body falls is really moving as much as the Earth is. -->

<!--  use arguments to refute the motion of the real earth. This has no force against the motion of the earth I am describing to you.

For example, they say that if the earth moved, then:
- heavy bodies could not descend in a plumb line toward its center, but rather would have to depart from it every which way toward the heaven
- cannonballs 
- 

These and like things do not take place except when we suppose that the earth is not carried by the course of the heaven surrounding it, but that it is moved by some other force and in some other direction than that heaven.[53]
