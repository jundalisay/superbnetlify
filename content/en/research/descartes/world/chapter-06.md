Let's think about a universe, beyond this one, confined in imaginary spaces which are infinite. <!-- The philosophers tell us that these spaces are infinite, and they should very well be believed, since it is they themselves who have made the spaces so.[25]  --> Let us go back in time after all the matter has been created. At this point, the aethereal has filled all. We limit our space to the distance from the earth to the distant stars. This space has nothing other than the aether. 

<!-- Yet, in order that this infinity not impede us and not embarrass us, let us not try to go all the way to the end; let us enter in only so far that we can lose from view all the creatures that God made 6,000 years ago and, after having stopped there in some fixed place, let us suppose that God creates from anew so much matter all about us that, in whatever direction our imagination can extend itself, it no longer perceives any place that is empty. -->

<!-- Although the sea is not infinite, those who are on some vessel in the middle of it can extend their view seemingly to infinity, and nevertheless there is still water beyond what they see.[26] Thus, even though our imagination seems to be able to extend itself to infinity, and this new matter is not assumed to be infinite, we can nonetheless well suppose that it fills spaces much greater than all those we shall have imagined.  -->

<!-- Indeed, in order that there be nothing in all this that you could find to blame, let us not permit our imagination to extend itself as far as it could, but let us purposely restrict it to a determinate space that is no greater, say, than the distance between the earth and the principal stars of the firmament, and let us suppose that the matter that God shall have created extends quite far beyond in all directions, out to an indefinite distance. For there is more reason, and we have much better the power, to prescribe limits to the action of our thought than to the works of God. -->

<!-- Now, since we are taking the liberty of imagining this matter to our fancy, let us attribute to it, if you will, a nature in which there is absolutely nothing that anyone cannot know as perfectly as possible. To that end, let us expressly assume that it does not have the form of earth, nor of fire, nor of air, nor any more particular form (such as wood, or a stone, or of a metal); nor does it have the qualities of being hot or cold, dry or moist, light or heavy, or of having some taste, or smell, or sound or color, or light, or suchlike, in the nature of which one could say that there is something that is not clearly known by everyone.[27]

Let us not also think, on the other hand, that our matter is that prime matter of the philosophers that has been so well stripped of all its forms and qualities that nothing more remains that can be clearly understood.[28] Let us rather conceive of it as a real, perfectly solid body, which uniformly fills the entire length, breadth, and depth of the great space at the center of which we have halted our thought. Thus, each of its parts always occupies a part of that space and is so proportioned to its size that it could not fill a larger one nor squeeze itself into a smaller one, nor (while it remains there) suffer another to find a place there. -->

This aether can be divided into any parts and according to any shapes. Each part can have any motion. God then divides it into many such parts, some larger and some smaller, some of one shape and some of another. God divides them without creating any void between them. Some move fast, some slow according to His laws. 
<!-- It is not that He thereby separates them from one another, so that there is some void in between them; rather, let us think that the entire distinction that He makes there consists in the diversity of the motions He gives to them.  -->

<!-- From the first instant that they are created, He makes some begin to move in one direction and others in another, some faster and others slower (or indeed, if you wish, not at all); thereafter, He makes them continue their motion according to the ordinary laws of nature.  -->

<!-- For God has so wondrously established these laws that, even if we suppose that He creates nothing more than what I have said, and even if He does not impose any order or proportion on it but makes of it the most confused and most disordered chaos that the poets could describe,  -->

Those laws can make the parts of that chaos untangle themselves and be arranged in the right order[29] as to form a most perfect world. <!-- , in which one will be able to see not only light, but also all the other things, both general and particular, that appear in this true world. --> Thus, the simple aether turns into chaos.  

<!-- But, before I explain this at greater length, stop again for a bit to consider that 

chaos, and note that it contains nothing that is not so perfectly known to you that you could not even pretend not to know it. 

For, as regards the qualities that I have posited there, I have, if you have noticed, supposed them to be only such as you can imagine them. And, as regards the matter from which I have composed the chaos, there is nothing simpler nor easier to know among inanimate creatures. 

The idea of that matter is so included in all those that our imagination can form that you must necessarily conceive of it or you can never imagine anything. -->

<!-- Nonetheless, because the philosophers are so subtle that they can find difficulties in things that appear extremely clear to other men, and because the memory of their prime matter (which they know to be rather difficult to conceive of) could divert them from knowledge of the matter of which I speak, I should say to them at this point that  -->


The whole problem of philosophers in describing the aether is their inability to distinguish it from its own mass <!-- own proper quantity --> and size <!-- its outward space -->. The mass of aether does not differ from its substance, just as numbers do not differ from the idea of what a number is. 

<!-- In this, however, I am willing that they think themselves correct, for I have no intention of stopping to contradict them. But they should also not find it strange if I suppose that the quantity of the matter I have described does not differ from its substance any more than number differs from the things numbered.  -->

The size of aether is its true form and its essence. I make this analogy so that:
- ordinary people can understand it
- make everything clear so that there would be no hidden contradictions


<!-- Nor should they find it strange if I conceive of its space, or the property it has of occupying space, not as an accident, but as its true form and its essence. For they cannot deny that it is quite easy to conceive of it in that way. And my plan is not to set out (as they do) the things that are in fact in the true world, but only to make up as I please from [this matter] a [world] in which there is nothing that the densest minds are not capable of conceiving, and which nevertheless could be created exactly the way I have made it up. -->

<!-- Were I to posit in this new world the least thing that is obscure, it could happen that, within that obscurity, there might be some hidden contradiction I had not perceived, and thus that, without thinking, I might suppose something impossible. Instead, being able to imagine distinctly everything I am positing there, it is certain that, even if there be no such thing in the old world, God can nevertheless create it in a new one; for it is certain that He can create everything we can imagine.[30]
