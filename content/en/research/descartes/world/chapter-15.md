How do the inhabitants of the aethereal Earth see their heaven as wholly like we physical Earthlings see our sky? 

<!-- that of ours? -->

<!-- the inhabitants of Earth  -->

First, they see the `sun`  as completely full of light and like our sun, given that it sends rays from all points of its surface toward their eyes. Because it is much closer to them than the stars, it must appear much larger to them.

The small heaven `ABCD` turns around the earth. 
- Its parts offer some resistance to those rays. 

All the parts of the great heaven that are between `sun` and `D` strengthen the rays. 
- This is why those that are between `D` and `earth`, being comparatively small in number, can take away only very little of their force from them.

Even all the action of the parts of the large heaven `FGGF` is not enough to impede the rays of the many fixed stars from reaching to the earth from the sides not illuminated by the sun.

The 'large heavens' are those with a sun or star at its center.
- Solar systems can be rather unequal in size. 
- But they must always be exactly of the same force so that all the matter that is in the line `sun-B` must tend as strongly toward `moon` as that which is in the line `moon-B` tends toward `sun`. 
<!-- `Îµ` -->
- For, if they do not have that equality among them, they will most certainly be destroyed in a short time, or at least they will change until they have acquired it.

The whole force* of the ray `sun-B` is just exactly equal to that of the ray `moon-B`. 

> *Superphysics Note: This is now known as Newton's gravitational constant

The force of the ray `earth-B` is less than the force of `sun-B`.
- It cannot impede the force of the ray `moon-B`* to extend to `earth`. 

> *Superphysics Note: This is now known as the pull of a moon on a planet.


In the same way, `sirius` can extend its rays to `earth`
- The matter of the heaven between `sirius` and `2` aids them more than the matter between `4` and `earth` resists them.

Likewise:
- the matter between `3` and `4` aids the ray of `sirius` towards `earth`   
- the matter between `3` and `2` resists the ray of `sirius` towards `earth`

<!-- , and in addition in as much as that between 3 and 4 aids them no less than that between 3 and 2 resists them.  -->

Thus, those [aethereal] stars are the same as the physical stars that we see in the real world.
<!-- judging others proportionately, those stars must appear no less confusedly arranged, nor less in number, nor less unequal to one another, than do those we see in the real world. -->
- But in regard to their arrangement, they never appear in the true place where they are. 

For example:
- `alphacentauri` appears as if it were in the straight line `earth-R`
- `sirius` appears as if it were in the straight line `earth-4`.

**This is because the heavens are unequal in size.** 
- **The surfaces that separate them are arranged in a way that the rays that pass through them, from the stars toward the earth, never meet them at right angles.**

<!-- just about never so disposed that  -->


According to my demonstration in the Dioptrics [62], when the rays meet them obliquely, **there they must bend and undergo a great deal of refraction**.
- It causes them to pass much more easily through one side of this surface than through the other. 

<!-- TB -->
Those lines `earth-R`, `earth-4`, and ones like them are so extremely long compared to the diameter of Earth's orbit around the sun. 
- This makes the Earthlings always see the stars as fixed in the firmament. 
- **This is why astronomers say that they cannot observe parallax in the stars**.*

> *Translator's Note: Descartes removes the strongest empirical argument against the Copernican system. If, that is, the earth makes an annual circuit about the sun at a distance sufficient to account for observed planetary phenomena, observations of the fixed stars made from opposite sides of the orbit should differ by some amount. No one had been able to ascertain any difference, nor would anyone do so until the 19th century. Descartes joined Galileo and other defenders by arguing away the point with reference to the immense distance of the fixed stars.

<!-- Regarding the number of those stars, consider also that  -->


## Gravitational Lensing 

The same star can often appear in different places because of the different surfaces that divert its rays toward the earth.

For example, `sirius` appears simultaneously:
- in the line `earth-4` because of the ray `sirius-2-4-earth` 
- in the line `earth-f` because of the ray `sirius-6-f-earth`

This is similar to how objects are multiplied when one looks through glasses or other transparent bodies cut along several faces.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/lensing.jpg" alt="lensing" cap="Descartes described how gravitational lensing works far ahead of Einstein">}}


Stars appear much smaller than they are because of their extreme distance. This is why:
- most of them must not appear at all
- others appear only insofar as the rays of stars joined together render the parts of the firmament through which they pass a bit whiter. This is similar to:
  - the stars which astronomers call "nebulous," or
  - the great belt of our heaven that the poets pretend to be whitened by the milk of Juno*.

> *Translator's Note: Among the startling telescopic discoveries announced by Galileo in his Copernican works of the 1610s was the composition of the Milky Way; magnification revealed it to consist of a huge number of separate stars.

Despite this, the less distant stars are about equal to our sun<!-- , in order to judge that they can appear as large as the largest of our world -->.


## Surfaces

Generally, the bodies that send out stronger rays appear larger to the eyes of observers than the surrounding bodies with weaker ones.
- Consequently, such stars seem larger than the parts of their heavens that are nearby and equal to them [in size].

The refractions of the rays of stars take place at the surfaces `FG`, `GG`, `GF` and ones like them. 
- Such rays can be curved in such a way that they greatly increase the stars' size.
- Even when completely flat, those refractions increase the size.


Those surfaces are in a matter that is very fluid and that never ceases to move.
- It is very probable that this should always make the stars shake and quiver somewhat. 
- Consequently, this would make the stars appear to scintillate and vibrate, just as ours do.
  - This makes them <!-- , and even, because of their vibration, --> appear a bit larger. 

In this way, the moon appears larger when viewed from the bottom of a calm lake which is rippled by some wind. <!--  of which the surface is not very stirred up or agitated, but merely a bit rippled by the breath of some wind. -->

Over time, those surfaces change a bit.
- Some of them even bend noticeably in a short time, even if this only happens when a comet approaches them.

After a long time, This makes several stars seem to:
- change a bit in place without changing in size, or
- change a bit in size without changing in place. 

Some even begin suddenly to appear or disappear, just as one has seen happen in the real world*.

> *Translator's Note: The novae or "new stars" observed in 1572 and 1604 had much to do with the spread of Copernicanism and of opposition to it.



The planets and the comets that are in the heaven of our sun are made up of <!--  that are in the same heaven as the sun, knowing that the parts of the --> aethereal earth.
- This has parts <!-- of which they are composed are --> so large or so joined severally together that they can resist the action of light.
- This is why they are made visible by the rays of the sun by reflection.
  - This is similar to opaque objects in our room being visible to us throught the rays of a lamp.


The rays of a lamp are weakened the farther the objects are from it, in proportion to the size of the spherical surfaces they shine on.
- The resistance of the air also adds to the weakening. 
- This makes the objects near the lamp more lit than those far from it

The rays of the sun, however, conserve their force with distance. 
- They are even increasingly strengthened as they move away from the sun until they have reached the exterior surface of its heaven.
  - This is because all the matter of that heaven tends towards that surface.
- In contrast to the objects lit by the lamp, the planets near the sun are not more lit by the sun than the farthest planets or comets. 

<!-- The same thing also happens in the real world. I do not believe, however, that it is possible to give a reason for it if one supposes that light is anything in the objects other than an action or disposition such as I have set forth.  -->

<!-- I say an ; for, if you have attended well to what I have just demonstrated, to wit, that,  -->

Light is an action or disposition.

If the space where the sun is were totally void, then the parts of its heaven would continuously tend toward our eyes in the same way as when those parts are pushed by its matter (even with almost as much force).


 <!-- , you can well judge that --> there is just about no need to have any action in the sun itself nor just about even for it to be anything other than pure space in order to appear as we see it. 

This might seem paradoxical. 

The rotation of the planets makes them twinkle, but much weaker and in another way than the fixed stars do.
- The moon does not rotate and so it does not twinkle.
