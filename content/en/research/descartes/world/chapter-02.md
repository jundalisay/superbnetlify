Light naturally exists in the stars and flame, or fire.


## Movement in Parts

When flame burns wood, we see that it moves the small parts of the wood and separates them from one another. 
- This transforms the subtler parts into fire, air, and smoke, and leaving the grosser parts as ashes. 



<!-- Hence, someone else may, if he wishes, imagine the form of "fire," the quality of "heat," and the action that "burns" it to be completely different things in this wood.[6]  -->

<!-- For my part, afraid of misleading myself if I suppose anything more than what I see must of necessity be there, I am content to conceive there the motion of its parts. For, posit "fire" in the wood, posit "heat" in the wood, and make the wood "burn" as much as you please. 

If you do not suppose in addition that some of its parts are moved or detached from their neighbors, I cannot imagine that it would undergo any alteration or change. 

By contrast, remove the "fire," remove the "heat," prevent the wood from "burning:" provided only that you grant me that there is some power that violently moves the subtler of its parts and separates them from the grosser, I find that that alone will be able to cause in the wood all the same changes that one experiences when it burns. -->


Body `A` cannot move Body `B` unless Body `A` itself were also moving [7]. 

It means that the flame's body that acts against the wood is composed of small parts*. These move independently of one another with a very fast and violent motion.


> *Superphysics note: Unlike Newton who viewed motion from a large viewpoint, as from the perspective of 'Lord God', Descartes views movement from the quanta or small parts



They push and move with them the parts of the body that they touch and that do not offer much resistance. 

Its parts move independently of one another. Even though they often act together to create a single effect, they nonetheless act on their own against the bodies they touch. 

Their motion is very fast and very violent because they are so small that we cannot distinguish them by sight. They would not have the force to act against other bodies if the quickness of their motion did not compensate for their smallness.[8]

I add nothing concerning the direction in which each moves. 

<!-- For, if you consider that  -->

This is because the power to move and the power that determines that motion's direction are two completely different things. These can exist one without the other (as I have set out in the Dioptrics)[9]. Each part moves in the way least difficult* for it by the bodies around it.[10]

> *Superphysics note: This is the path of least resistance for each quantum



A flame can have parts going upward, downward, in straight lines, or circles. They can go in all directions, without changing anything of the flame's nature. 

Thus, if you see almost all of them tending upward, then it means that the bodies around them offer the least resistance in the upward motion. 

<!-- you need not think that this is for any other reason than that the other bodies touching them are almost always disposed to offer them greater resistance in any other direction. -->

<!-- But, having recognized that the parts of the flame move in this manner, and that it suffices to conceive of their motions in order to understand how the flame has the power to consume the wood and to burn, pray let us examine if the same will not also suffice to make us understand --> 

How does the flame heat us and give light for us? 

<!-- For, if that is the case, it will not be necessary for the flame to possess any other quality, and we will be able to say that it is this motion alone that is called now "heat" and now "light" according to the different effects it produces. -->

Our sensation of heat becomes pain when flame is violent, and tickling when flame is moderate.[11] 

This tickling and pain only comes from our mind. <!-- There is nothing outside our thought that is similar to the ideas we conceive of . --> Thus, everything we touch also comes from our mind. <!-- we can well believe also that there is nothing that is similar to that which we conceive of heat; rather, anything that can move the small parts of our hands, or of any other part of our body, can arouse this sensation in us. --> 

Many experiences favor this opinion. For example, by rubbing our hands together we heat them without any fire. <!-- , and any other body can also be heated without being placed close to a fire, provided only that it is shaken and rubbed in such a way that many of its small parts are moved and can move with them those of our hands --> <!-- As regards light, one can also well imagine that  --> The same motion that is in the flame causes us to sense light. <!-- But, because it is in this that the main part of my design consists, I want to try to explain it at some length and to take up my discourse from anew.
