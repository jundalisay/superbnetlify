The following cannot explain the phenomena of diffraction:
- the corpuscular theory
- the principle of interference when applied only to direct rays and to rays reflected or inflected at the very edge of the opaque screen

The proper theory is in the terms of waves. This is based on:
- the principle of Huygens and
- the principle of interference

Both of these are inferences from the fundamental hypothesis that light consists in vibrations of the aether similar to sound-waves.
- This lets us easily account for the inflection of rays of light at sensible distances from the diffracting body. 

When any small portion of an elastic fluid under-* 

The rise of a liquid in a capillary tube occurs between two surfaces separated by a finite distance, although the attraction which these surfaces exert upon the liquid extends only to an infinitely small distance. 

The reason of this is, that the molecules of the liquid, attracted by the surface of the tube, also in their turn attract other molecules of the liquid situated within their sphere of action, and so on, step by step ; but in the emission-theory an analogous explanation is not admissible, for the funda- mental hypothesis is that the luminous particles never exert any sensible effect upon the path of neighboring particles. 

No interdependence of motion is here admissible, for such an assumption would be the assumptionof a fluid medium.

goes condensation, for instance, it tends to expand in all direc-tions ; and if throughout the entire wave the particles are dis-placed only along the normal, the result would be that all points of the wave lying upon the same spherical surface wouldsimultaneously suffer the same condensation or expansion, thusleaving the transverse pressures in equilibrium ; but whenaportion of the wave-front is intercepted or retarded in its pathby interposing an opaque or transparent screen, it is easily seenthat this transverse equilibrium is destroyed and that variouspoints of the wave may now send out rays along new directions.

To follow by analytical mechanics all the various changeswhich a wave-front undergoes from the instant at which a partof it is intercepted by a screen would be an exceedingly diffi- cult task, and we do not propose to derive the laws of diffrac-tion in this manner, nor do we propose to inquire what happens in the immediate neighborhood of the opaque body, wherethe laws are doubtless very complicated and where the formof the edge of the screen must have a perceptible effect uponthe position and the intensity of the fringes. We proposerather to compute the relative intensities at different pointsof the wave-front only after it has gone a large number of wavelengths beyond the screen. Thus the positions at which westudy the waves are always to be regarded as separated fromthe screen by a distance which is very considerable comparedwith the length of a light-wave.

34. We shall not take up the problem of vibrations in anelastic fluid from the point of view which the mathematicians have ordinarily employed that is, considering only a single disturbance. 

Single vibrations are never met with in nature.

Disturbances occur in groups, as is seen:
- in the pendulum and
- in sounding bodies. 

Vibrations of luminous particles occur in the same way -- one after another and series after series. 

This hypothesis follows from analogy and as an inference from the nature of the forces which hold the particles of a body in equilibrium. 

A single luminous particle may perform a large series of oscillations all of which are nearly equal.
- This is because its density is much greater than that of the fluid in which it vibrates.

This is has already been inferred from the uniformity of the motions of the planets through this same fluid which fills planetary space.

It is probable also that the optic nerve yields the sensation of sight only after having received a considerable number of successive stimuli.

However extended the systems of wave-fronts are, they have limits.

 and that in consideringinterference we cannot predicate of their extreme portionsthat which is true for the region in which they are superposed.

Thus, 2 systems of equal wave-length and of equal intensity, differing in path by half a wave, interfere destructively only at those points in the aether where they meet.
- The 2 extreme half wave-lengths escape interference. 

Nevertheless, the various systems of waves undergo the same change throughout their entire extent, the error introduced by this assumption being inappreciable ; or, what amounts to the same thing, we shall assume in our discussion of interference that these series oflight-waves represent general vibrations of the ether, and are undefined as to their limits.

## THE PROBLEM OF INTERFERENCE

35. Given the intensities and relative positions of any numberof trains of light-waves of the same length* and travelling in thesame direction, to determine the intensity of the vibrations produced by the meeting of these different trains of loaves, that is, the oscillatory velocity of the ether particles.

We shall not here consider light-waves of different lengths which, in general, come from different sources and which cannot, therefore, giverise to simultaneous disturbances and cannot by their interaction produceany phenomena which are uniform ; and even if they were uniform, therise and fall of intensity produced by the interference of two different kinds of waves, after the manner of beats in sound, would be far toorapid to be detected, and would produce only a sensation of constant in- tensity. 

It was Mr. Thomas Young who first introduced the principle of inter- ference into optics, where he showed much ingenuity in applying it to special cases; but in the problems which he has thus solved he has considered, I think, only the limiting cases, where the difference in phase be- tween the two trains of waves is either a maximum or a minimum, and hasnot computed the intensity of the light for any intermediate cases or forany number whatever of trains of waves, as I here propose to do. 

Employing the general principle of the superposition ofsmall motions, the total velocity impressed upon any particleof a fluid is equal to the sum of the velocities impressed byeach train of waves acting by itself. When these waves do notcoincide, these different velocities depend not only upon theintensity of each wave, but also upon its phase at the instantunder consideration. We must, therefore, know the law ac-cording to which the velocity of vibration varies in any onewave, and for this purpose we must trace the wave back to theorigin whence it derives all its characteristics.

36. It is natural to suppose that the particles whose vibra-tions produce light perform their oscillations like those ofsounding bodies that is, according to the laws which hold forthe pendulum ; or, what is the same thing, to suppose that theacceleration tending to make a particle return to its positionof equilibrium is directly proportional . to the displacement.Let us denote this displacement by x. A suitable function ofthis displacement can then be represented by the expressionAx + Bx* + Cxs -\-etc., since this will vanish when #=0. 

If, now,we suppose the excursion of the particle to be very small whencompared with the radius of the sphere throughout whichthe forces of attraction and repulsion act, we can neglect incomparison with Ax all other terms of the series and consider the acceleration as practically proportional to the dis-tance x. This hypothesis, to which we are led by analogy,and which is the simplest that one can make concerning thevibrations of light particles, ought to lead to accurate results,since the laws of optics remain the same for all intensities oflight.
Let us represent by v the velocity of vibration of a light particle at the end of a time t. We shall then have dvAxdt; but v=dxldt, or dt =dx/v. Substituting in the first equation,we have vdvAxdx. Integrating, we have v*=C Ax2
; andhence
A
Substituting this value of x in the first equation, we have
dv


which, on integration, gives
VA Vc'
If we measure time from the instant at which the velocityis zero, the constant C' becomes zero, and we have
1 . , v
- or v=
If we employ as unit of time the interval occupied by the particle in one complete vibration, we have v= VU sin (M).Thus, in isochronous vibrations, the velocities for equal valuesof t are always proportional to the constant V0, which, therefore, measures the intensity of the vibration.

37. Let us now consider the wave produced in the ether bythe vibrations of this particle. The energy of motion in theether at any point on the wave depends upon the velocity of the point-source at the instant when it started a disturbancewhich has just reached this point. The velocity of the etherparticles at any point in space after an interval of time t is proportional to that of the point-source at the instant txl\,xbeing the distance of this point from the source of motion and\ the length of a light-wave. Let us denote by u the velocity
of the ether particles. 

We then have
uci sin We know that the intensity a of vibration* [oscillatory velocity'} in a fluid is in inverse ratio to the distance of the wavefrom the centre of disturbance; but, considering how minutethese waves are when compared with the distance which sep- arates them from the luminous point, we may neglect the va- riation of a and consider it as constant throughout the extentof one or even of several waves.

38. By the aid of this expression one can compute the in- tensity of vibration produced by the meeting of any numberof pencils of light whenever he knows the intensity of thedifferent trains of waves and their respective positions.
Let us first determine the velocity of a luminous particle in a vibration which results from the interference of two trains

of waves displaced, one with respect to the other, by a quarter of a wave-length [i.e., differing in phase ~by 90], and having intensities which we shall denote by a and a'. We shallcount time, t, from the moment at which the vibrations of thefirst train begin. Let u and u' be the velocities which the first and second trains of waves would impress upon a light particlewhose distance from the source of motion is x. We then haveua sin 2-* It

; but this is exactly thevalue of the resultant of two mutually rectangular forces, aand a'. From the same equations it is easily seen also that the newwave exactly corresponds in angular position [phase] to ,theresultant of the two mutually rectangular forces a and a'; forthe equation
U=A sin shows that the linear displacement of this wave with respecti\ to the first is ; but i is also the angle which the force a
makes with the resultant A, because A cos i a. Thus wehave complete analogy between the resultant of two mutuallyrectangular forces and the resultant of two trains of waves dif fering in phase by a quarter of a wave-length.

39. The solution of this particular case for waves differing by a quarter of a wave-length suffices to solve all other cases. In fact, whatever be the number of the trains of waves, andwhatever be the intervals which separate them, we can alwayssubstitute for each of them its components referred to two ref- erence points which are common to each train of waves and whichare distant from each other by a quarter of a wave-length;then adding or subtracting, according to sign, the intensities of the components referred to the same point, we may reduce the
whole motion to that of two trains of waves separated by the
distance of a quarter of a wave-length; and the square root
of the sum of the squares of their intensities will be the intensity of their resultant; but this is exactly the method employed in statics to ftrid the resultant of any number of forces ; here the wave-length corresponds to one circumference in the
statical problem, and the interval of a quarter of a wavelength between the trains of waves to an angular displacementof 90 between the components.

40. It very often happens in optics that the intensities of
light or the particular tint which one wishes to compute is produced by the meeting of only two trains of waves, as in the
case of [Newton's] colored rings and the ordinary phenomena of color presented by crystalline plates. It is, therefore, well to know the general expression for the resultant of two trains of waves differing in phase by any amount whatever. The result
is easily predicted from the general method which I haveexplained, but I think it will be wise to emphasize somewhatthe theory of vibrations, and to show directly that the waveresulting from two others, separated by any interval whatever,
corresponds exactly in intensity and position to the resultant
of two forces whose intensities are equal to those of the twopencils of light, making an angle with each other which bears
to one complete circumference the same ratio that the in- terval between the two trains of waves bears to one wavelength.

Let x be the distance from the origin of the first train of waves to the light particle under consideration, and t the instant for which we wish to compute its velocity. The speedimpressed by the first train of waves will be a sin [fc (<-)], where a represents the intensity of this ray of light. 

Let us call a' the intensity of the second pencil, and let usdenote by c the distance between corresponding points on thetwo trains of waves; the [oscillatory] velocity due to the secondtrain will then be
