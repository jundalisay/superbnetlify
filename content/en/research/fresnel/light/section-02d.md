Number of bright or dark bands
counted from middle. 

Evidently theory and observations agree in general quite well, although in the second and fourth observations the dis-agreement is quite marked and rather more than one wouldexpect from the size of the fringes ; for in the second observation the individual measures differ at most by 0.04 mm., andthe fourth observation, which I have already described, agreesperfectly, as has been seen, with another experiment in whichthe same fringes appear. This disagreement, therefore, canonly be explained by assuming that the theory is wrong or thatconstant errors have entered the observations through opticalillusion.


74. Our theory rests upon a hypothesis which is at once so simple and so inherently probable.

It has been so strikingly verified by many varied experiments, that one can scarcely doubt the truth of the fundamental principle. 

Anomalies are only apparent when the eye does not correctly estimate the position of the minima in question. 

<!-- We must remember that they are not very sharp,and that they are always bounded on each side by two brightbands of very different intensities. Now, in order  -->

To determine the position of the minimum, my eye must include a partof each of these two bands, so that that part of the dark bandon the side next the brightest appears to me darker still on account of its environment.

Thus attracting, as it were, theapparent minimum to its side, and, indeed, all the discrepancieslie in this direction. 

That the eye includes a sufficiently largeportion of the fringes for correctly estimating the position ofmaxima and minima is evident from the fact that in repeatingthe fourth observation, using a diaphragm of small aperture inthe focus of the micrometer eye-piece, nothing was left but aband which was uniformly dark and in which the minimum was no longer distinguishable. 

If I have succeeded in getting the correct positions of the minima in the exterior fringeseven in regions of poor definition, it is owing to the fact thatthe bright bands between which these are included differ veryslightly in intensity ; and if, in the case of the narrow aperture and cylindrical lens, experiment and theory happen to agree inspite of great differences of intensity between two adjoining bright bands, this is because the dark band, especially in thefirst and second orders, is almost perfectly black. In general,whenever the maximum or minimum is very sharp, I find.ox136

perirnent and calculation in thorough agreement. 

In the fifth observation, for instance, I measure the distance from the centreto the maximum of the first order because this bright band is very well defined, and I am therefore able to determine its mostbrilliant point with great precision. The difference betweenthe computed and observed values is indeed only 0.01 mm.

75. But our theory does more than merely give us the positions of maxima and minima, for it enables us to predict thegeneral appearance of the phenomena, so that, without experimental determination, we can foretell the variations of intensityin the light.

Thus, for instance, in the fifth observation the partof the shadow corresponding to the middle of the aperture wasfilled by a large dark band of a tint that was practically uniform up to 0.26 mm. on each side of the centre, after whichthe intensity of the light increased rapidly so as to form thebright band of the first order which I have just mentioned.

Now in computing the intensity of the light within theselimits, we find that in fact its intensity varies scarcely at all, but that in passing from these limits to the bright band it in- creases very rapidly. In the following table are given the re- sults of computation for different points of the dark band andthe two bright bands which include it. The position of eachpoint is denoted by the corresponding value of v, measured al- ways from one of the edges of the aperture.

[Five pages, in which the case of a narrow opaque obstacle is discussed, are here omitted.]
79. I have now applied the principle of Huygens to thethree general classes of phenomena in which diffraction occurs,namely, first, to the fringes produced by a screen whose edgesare straight and infinitely long, and which is so large that thelight passes practically only one edge of the screen ; secondly,to the fringes produced by a system of two similar screensbrought very near together ; thirdly, to those fringes whichaccompany the shadow of a very narrow screen.* Comparing observations with the predictions of the theory,I have shown that it suffices to explain the most diverse phenomena, and that the general expression for the intensity oflight derived from it gives us a faithful picture of the phenomena, even when they are most bizarre and apparently irregular,Besides the three general classes, one might devise a largenumber of others by combining these among themselves. Thetheory would doubtless apply here with the same success andthe same ease. The computation would be more tedious inproportion as the variety of limits assigned to the integrals be-came greater and greater ; the experiments would also demandmore complicated apparatus.

80. In the first section of this memoir I have described aphenomenon which results from a combination of two of theprincipal cases of diffraction, namely, the fringes produced by* I do riot here include those fringes which are produced by the biprism,or two mirrors slightly inclined to each other, for, properly speaking,these are not diffraction effects, since they are not produced by rays whichare diffracted or inflected, but by two pencils which are regularly re
fleeted or refracted. 

light in passing through two apertures, each very narrow andeach near to the other. Having prepared a sheet of copper inthe form drawn in Fig. 15, I noted that
when the large fringes produced by each
of the slits CEC'E' and DFD'F', expanding as I moved away from the screen, had G_ filled the shadow 6f CDFE so that it con-
" tained only the bright band of the first order, the interference bands resulting
from the twc pencils of light became much sharper and brighter than the interior fringes of the part ABCD. The Fig. 15 lower part, CEDF, which was at first brighter than the other,became darker the farther I went away from the screen, butits fringes continued to show colors which in white light werepurer and bands which in homogenous light were sharper.With the simple apparatus which I employed one could not obtain exact measures, and I have not therefore carried out thecomputations for this experiment ; accordingly I limit myselfto the explanation of these phenomena by means of some general considerations.
Let L be the luminous point, and IK the horizontal projec-tion of the part AEBF of the screen represented in Fig 15. Pis any point in the interior of the shadow lying upon the straightline LO. From the point L as centre, andwith a radius equal to LI, describe the arcIMM', representing the incident wave. Nowwith a point P as centre, arid with a radiusequal to IP, describe the arc Imm'. The vari- ous distances between these two arcs give usthe differences of path traversed by the sec- ondary waves meeting at P. We shall first consider the upper part of the screen that is, the case where the wave IMM' is not inter- cepted on the other side of the point I. Letus now imagine this wave divided into alarge number of small arcs, IM, MM', etc., in such a manner that the straight lines drawn to P from any two consecutive pointsof division differ by half a wave-length ; and,for sake of simplicity, let us suppose that the

point P lies well within the edge of the shadow, or, what is thesame thing, let us imagine the ray IP sufficiently inclined tothe incident ray to make these arcs practically equal. Theneach of these arcs, excepting the one at the end IM, will lie be-tween two others, which will combine to annul its effect at thepoint P. In the case of the arc IM, which lies at the extremeedge of the wave, we have, however, an exception ; for this arcloses only one-half its intensity by interference with the vibra-tions of the neighboring arc, MM'. If, therefore, we interceptthis arc [MM'] and all the rest of the incident wave, the lightwhich is received by the point P will actually be increased ;* this is precisely the effect which, at a certain distance, is pro-duced by the part of the screen G'C'E" (Fig. 15). But inproportion as the point P (Fig. 22) recedes from the opaquescreen, the arc \mrti approaches the wave IMM' ; and in thecase where the luminous point L is at an infinite distance,these two approach indefinitely near to each other. The di-visions M, M', etc., being determined by the separation ofthese two arcs, keep spreading apart from the point I in pro-portion as the arcs approach each other. It follows, therefore,that the part MI of the incident wave will grow larger andlarger, and the rays from this part passing the edge (Fig. 15)retain at least half their intensity in the region behind theupper part of the screen. But in the lower part of the screenthe aperture CEC'E' does not increase in size, so that if theluminous' point is far enough away the effective arc IM (Fig. 22)will finally become so large compared with this aperture that[most of the rays from MI are intercepted by GC'E', and hence]the point will receive less light in the lower part of the shadowthan in the upper.

Let us now pass to the consideration of fringes produced bythe meeting of rays coming from both edges of the screen,AEBF (Fig. 15). Behind the upper part, ABOD, the inflectedlight diminishes rapidly in intensity .as one recedes from theedge of the geometrical shadow, and therefore all the fringesexcept those which are very near the middle are produced bj
two rays of very unequal intensities ; consequently the dark* The light at P would be increased still more if the screen were perfo- rated in such a way as to permit all the arcs of even order to pass throughand at the same time intercept all the arcs of odd order. 

bands are not very sharp when one uses homogeneous light,and the colors are mixed with gray when one uses white light.Behind the lower part, CEDF, the two pencils of light comingfrom the slits CEO'E ' and DFD'F ' have a practically uniformintensity throughout a considerable portion of the bright bandfrom each of these apertures ; and if these apertures are so nar-row compared with the distance between them that the regionof uniform intensity in the inflected light includes all thefringes produced by the two pencils, then in those points wherethe vibrations are in complete discordance the light-waves willalmost completely destroy one another ; accordingly the darkbands will be very much sharper than in the upper part of theshadow when homogeneous light is employed, and the colorswill be very much purer when white light is used. When onelooks at these points close up to the screen before the largerfringes which are produced by each slit have spread out intothe shadow AEBF, the phenomenon becomes very complicatedand changes rapidly with the distance of the rnagnifying-glass,especially when the distance between the two slits is not verygreat when compared with their size. It would be interestingto determine by computation the positions of the maxima andminima of the bright and dark bands, and to compare these re-sults with those of observation. I have no doubt that the the-ory would thus acquire fresh confirmation.


81. Hitherto we have considered all waves as coming fromasingle centre, but, in actual experiment, luminous points arealways made up of a very large number of centres of vibration,and it is to each one of these by itself that the preceding dis-cussion applies. So long as these are not very widely sepa-rated from each other, the fringes which they produce practically coincide, but the dark bands from one overlap the brightbands of the other in proportion as we increase the dimensionsof the luminous point, until finally they completely annul eachother. In the case of the exterior fringes this effect is moreand more appreciable as one gets farther and farther awayfrom the screen, because it increases directly as the distance,while the size of the bright and dark bands increases less rapidly. And this is why a luminous source sufficiently small toproduce fringes which, in the near neighborhood of an opaquebody, are very sharp will, at a considerable distance from thisbody, give only ill-defined fringes.

82. It is not necessary that the interposed body should beopaque in order to produce the phenomena of diffraction at itsedges ; all that is required is that a part of the wave should beretarded with respect to its neighboring parts, but this is ex-actly what a transparent body does when its refractive indexdiffers appreciably from that of the medium surrounding it ; it thus gives rise to fringes which border both the inside and theoutside of their shadow. They are exactly like the exteriorfringes of opaque bodies when the difference of path betweenthe rays which have traversed the transparent screen and theoutside rays contains a considerable number of wave-lengths, be-cause their mutual influence [interference] is no longer appreciable and we have simply the addition of two uniform illu-minations. But this is not the case when the transparent screenis very even or when its refractive index differs very slightlyfrom that of the surrounding medium, for now the fringes arealtered in a very marked way by the mutual influence of thoserays which traverse the transparent plate and those which passits edge. It is from similar reasons that the striae in layers ofmica resulting from slight differences of thicknesses give rise,in white light, to colored fringes in the very peculiar mannerdescribed by M. Arago.

83. As to fringes of the kind which we have called interior,they are not to be obtained with a narrow transparent body,because  the direct light which traverses it is so much brighterthan the inflected rays as to mask the^effects of interference;and, besides, the bright and dark bands which this transparentbody tends to produce, when considered as a narrow aperture,do not coincide with those which it tends to produce whenconsidered as a small obstacle.

84. The phenomena of diffraction, once explained for thecase of homogeneous light, are easily predicted for the case ofwhite light. These fringes come from the superposition of all the bright and dark bands of the various sizes produced by thedifferent kinds of waves which go to make up white light, sothat when we have once computed the intensity of each of theprincipal kinds of rays at the point under consideration, usingthe proper wave-length, according to the theory which I havejust explained, we can find the resultant tint by substitutingthese values in Newton's empirical formula for determining theresult obtained by mixing any set of colored rays.


85. Polished surfaces illuminated by a point-source presenta set of diffraction phenomena exactly like those which we ob-serve in direct light. The field of light reflected by a mirroris bordered with fringes similar to those which surround theshadows of bodies. 

If the surfaces be very narrow or so black-ened that only a single bright line remains, or indeed if oneinclines the mirror in such a way as to diminish greatly thesize of the field [foot-note here omitted], the phenomenon of apencil of light dilated by passing through a very narrow aperturewill be reproduced. If a mirror be blackened throughout its entire extent, with the exception of two bright lines, it givesrise to a set of fringes identical with those produced by twoparallel slits in an opaque screen. 

If, instead of blackening thelarge part of the reflecting surface, one, on the contrary, merely traces a single fine black line, it will produce fringes similarto those observed in the shadow of a narrow screen. 

In short, the phenomena are absolutely the same as if the mirror weretransparent and the rays came from the image of the luminouspoint. The explanation is very simple ; for we know that theimage (which lies upon the perpendicular drawn from the lu- minous point to the mirror, and which is situated at a distancefrom the surface of the mirror equal to the distance of the lu- minous point from the mirror), has this remarkable property,namely, that its distance from any point on the surface of themirror is equal to the distance of the same point from the lu- minous centre. When, therefore, we consider the rays as originating in the image of a luminous point, we do not alter thedifference of path traversed by the elementary waves whichproduce the fringes, and consequently there is no change in the size, or in the relative intensities, of the bright and darkbands.

I may here remark that the position [pliase] of the resultantof the secondary waves at any point, depending as it does merelyupon differences of path, ought, in the case of reflection, to bethe same as if the rays were emitted by the image just mentioned. Consequently, in the case of a polished surface of large area, all the partial resultants will be situated at thesame distance from this point, thus making it the centre of the reflected wave.

86. It is by means of these secondary waves that Huygenshas explained in such a simple manner the laws of reflection and refraction, showing that they are phenomena of the samekind as the propagation of light in a homogeneous medium;but his explanation leaves much to be desired. He has notproved that there will be only one system of waves resultingfrom this multitude of systems of secondary waves, for he hasnot used the principle of interference. He assumes that thelight is appreciable only in those points where the secondarywaves coincide [in phase] exactly ; while the complete absenceof any luminous disturbance can occur only when the secondary disturbances are in [direct] opposition. It was this, doubtless, that led him to think that light was not inflected to anyappreciable extent into shadows, and which prevented himfrom discovering the phenomena of diffraction, the laws ofwhich his theory could have given him without recourse to ex-periment.

This theory, when combined with the principle of interfer-ence, gives us not only the path of the ray in the particularcase where reflection occurs at a polished surface of indefiniteextent, but also in those cases where the surface is very nar-row or even discontinuous ; it shows us how diminution insize of the surface produces the dilation of the reflected ray,and how a system of very narrow mirrors placed side by sideand very close together can produce colored images, owing tothe mutual influence of pencils of light thus dilated. This is the phenomenon of ruled surfaces. With the same ease it ex-plains the images and colored rings produced by a thin fabricor even an irregular combination of very fine threads or smallparticles, provided they are almost equal in size, when placedbetween the eye of the observer and the luminous point.
I think it hardly necessary to emphasize these phenomena,since they are merely combinations of those described above,and since I have attempted to give, for all of them, a generaltheory.
