A man dies, leaving two sons behind. 
- He bequeathes 1/3 of his capital to a stranger.  
- He leaves ten dirhems of property and a claim of 10 dirhems on one of the sons.

"Sum" is taken out of the debt thing. Add this to the capital which is 10 dirhams. The sum is 10 and the debt. Subtract 1/3 of this, since he has bequeathed 1/3 of his property which is 3 dirhams and 1/3 debt.

The sum is dirhems.
