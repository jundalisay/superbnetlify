The frequencies of the lines of the series spectrum of hydrogen may, if we look apart from the fine
structure of the single lines revealed by instruments of high dispersive power, be represented by the formula

```
ν = K

1
n002
−

n02

, (35)
```

where K is a constant, and n
0 and n
00 a set of two entire
numbers, different for the different lines of the spectrum.
According to the general principles of the quantum theory
of line spectra discussed in the first section of Part I, we shall
therefore expect that this spectrum is emitted by a system
which possesses a series of stationary states in which the
numerical value of the energy in the n
th state, omitting an
arbitrary constant, with a high degree of approximation is
given by
En =
Kh
n2
, (36)
where h is Planck’s constant which enters in the fundamental relation (1).
Now according to Rutherford’s theory of atomic structure, a neutral hydrogen atom must be expected to consist
71
of an electron and a positive nucleus of a mass very large
compared with that of the electron, which move under the
influence of a mutual attraction inversely proportional to
the square of the distance apart. Assuming that the motion in the stationary states may be determined by ordinary
mechanics, and neglecting for the moment the small modifications claimed by the theory of relativity, we find that each
of the particles will describe an elliptical orbit with their
common centre of gravity at one of the foci, and from the
well known laws for a Keplerian motion we have that the
frequency of revolution ω and the major axis 2α of the relative orbit of the particles, quite independent of the degree
of eccentricity of this orbit, are given by
ω =
r
2W3
(M + m)
π
2N2e
4Mm
, 2α =
Ne2
W
, (37)
where W is the work necessary to remove the electron to
infinite distance from the nucleus, while Ne and M are the
charge and the mass of the nucleus, and −e and m the charge
and the mass of the electron.
As explained in Part I, there will in general be no simple
connection between the motion of a system in the stationary
states and the spectrum emitted during transitions between
these states; such a connection, however, must be expected to
exist in the limit where the motions in successive stationary
states differ comparatively little from each other. In the
present case this connection claims in the first place that
the frequency of revolution tends to zero for increasing n.
72
According to (36) and (37) we may therefore put the value
of W in the n
th stationary state equal to
Wn =
Kh
n2
. (38)
Moreover, since (35) can be written in the form
ν = (n
0 − n
00)K
n
0 + n
00
n02n002
,
it is seen to be a necessary condition that the frequency of
revolution for large values of n is asymptotically given by
ωn ∼
2K
n3
, (39)
if we wish that the frequency of the radiation emitted during
a transition between two stationary states, for which the
numbers n
0 and n
00 are large compared with their difference
n
0 − n
00, shall tend to coincide with one of the frequencies of
the spectrum which on ordinary electrodynamics would be
emitted from the system in these states. But from (37) and
(38) it will be seen that (39) claims the fulfilment of the
relation
K =

4Mm
h
3
(M + m)
=
2π
2N2

. (40)
As shown in previous papers, this relation is actually
found to be fulfilled within the limit of experimental errors
73
if we put N = 1 and for e, m, and h introduce the values
deduced from measurements on other phenomena; a result
which may be considered as affording a strong support for the
validity of the general principles discussed in Part I, as well
as for the reality of the atomic model under consideration.
Further it was found that, if in formula (35) for the hydrogen
spectrum the constant K is replaced by a constant which is
four times larger, this formula represents to a high degree
of approximation the frequencies of the lines of a spectrum
emitted by helium, when this gas is subject to a condensed
discharge. This was to be expected on Rutherford’s theory, according to which a neutral helium atom contains two
electrons and a nucleus of a charge twice that of the nucleus
of the hydrogen atom. A helium atom from which one electron is removed will thus form a dynamical system perfectly
similar to a neutral hydrogen atom, and may therefore be expected to emit a spectrum represented by (35) if in (40) we
put N = 2. Moreover a closer comparison of the helium spectrum under consideration with the hydrogen spectrum has
shown that the value of the constant K in the former spectrum was not exactly four times as large as that in the latter,
but that the ratio between these constants within the limit
of experimental errors agreed with the value to be expected
from (40), when regard is taken to the different masses of the
nuclei of the atoms of hydrogen and helium corresponding to
the different atomic weights of these elements.1

Now for a mechanical system as that under consideration,
for which every motion is periodic independent of the initial
conditions, we have that the value of the total energy will
be completely determined by the value of the quantity I,
defined by equation (5) in Part I. As mentioned this follows
directly from relation (8), which shows at the same time that
for a system for which every motion is periodic the frequency
will be completely determined by I or by the energy only.
For the value of I in the stationary states of the hydrogen
atom we get by means of (8) from (37) and (41), since in this
case I will obviously become zero when W becomes infinite,

This result will be seen to be consistent with condition (24)
which, as mentioned in Part I, presents itself as a direct
generalisation to periodic systems of several degrees of freedom of condition (10) which determines the stationary states
of a system of one degree of freedom, and which again on
Ehrenfest’s principle of the mechanical transformability
of the stationary states forms a rational generalisation of
Planck’s fundamental formula (9) for the possible values
of the energy of a linear harmonic vibrator.
In this connection it will be observed, that the relation
discussed above between the hydrogen spectrum and the motion of the atom in the limit of small frequencies is completely
analogous to the general relation, discussed in § 2 in Part I,
between the spectrum which on the quantum theory would
be emitted by a system of one degree of freedom, the stationary states of which are determined by (10), and the motion
of the system in these states. It will at the same time be
noted that, in case of hydrogen, this relation implies that
the motion of the particles in the stationary states of the
atom will not in general be simply harmonic, or in other
words that the orbit of the electron will not in general be
circular. In fact if the motion of the particles were simply
harmonic, as the motion of a Planck’s vibrator, we should
expect on the considerations in Part I that no transition between two stationary states of the atom would be possible
for which n
0 and n
00 differ by more than one unit; but this
would obviously be inconsistent with the observations, since
for instance the lines of the ordinary Balmer series, accord-
76
ing to the theory, correspond to transitions for which n
00 = 2
while n
0
takes the values 3, 4, 5, . . . . In connection with
this consideration it may be remarked that, adopting a terminology well known from acoustics, we may from the point
of view of the quantum theory regard the higher members
of the Balmer series (n
0 = 4, 5, . . . ) as the “harmonics” of
the first member (n
0 = 3), although of course the frequencies
of the former lines are by no means entire multipla of the
frequency of the latter line.
While in the above way it was possible to obtain a simple interpretation of certain main features of the hydrogen
spectrum, it was not found possible in this way to account in
detail for such phenomena in which the deviation of the motion of the particles from a simple Keplerian motion plays
an essential part. This is the case in the problem of the
fine structure of the hydrogen lines, which is due to the effect of the small variation of the mass of the electron with
its velocity, as well as in the problems of the characteristic
effects of external electric and magnetic fields on the hydrogen lines. As mentioned in the introduction, a progress
of fundamental importance in the treatment of such problems was made by Sommerfeld, who obtained a convincing explanation of the fine structure of the hydrogen lines
by means of his theory of the stationary states of central
systems, in which the single condition I = nh was replaced
by the two conditions (16); and the theory was further developed by Epstein and Schwarzschild, who on this line
established the general theory, based on the conditions (22),
77
of the stationary states of a conditionally periodic system
for which the equations of motion may be solved by means
of separation of variables in the Hamilton-Jacobi partial
differential equation. If the hydrogen atom is exposed to a
homogeneous electric or to a homogeneous magnetic field,
the atom forms a system of this class, and, as shown by Epstein and Schwarzschild as regards the Stark effect and
by Sommerfeld and Debye as regards the Zeeman effect,
the theory under consideration leads to values for the total
energy of the atom in the stationary states, which together
with relation (1) lead again to values for the frequencies of
the radiations emitted during the transitions between these
states, which are in agreement with the measured frequencies
of the components into which the hydrogen lines are split up
in the presence of the fields. As pointed out in Part I, it is
possible moreover to throw light on the question of the intensities and polarisations of these components on the basis of
the necessary formal relation between the quantum theory of
line spectra and the ordinary theory of radiation in the limit
where the motions in successive stationary states differ very
little from each other. In the following sections the mentioned problems will be discussed in detail. As regards the
fixation of the stationary states we shall not, however, follow
the same procedure as used by the authors just mentioned,
which rests upon the immediate application of the conditions (22), but it will be shown how the conditions which fix
the stationary states of the perturbed atom may be obtained
by a direct examination of the small deviations of the motion
78
of the electron from a simple Keplerian motion. In this way
it seems possible to obtain a more direct illustration of the
principles discussed in Part I; and we shall see moreover that
the treatment in question may be used also in cases where
the method of separation of variables cannot be applied.
In Part III the problem of the series spectra of other
elements will be treated from a similar point of view. As
pointed out by the writer in an earlier paper, a simple explanation of the pronounced analogy between these spectra
and the hydrogen spectrum is offered by the fact, that the
atomic systems, involved in the emission of the spectra under consideration, in a certain sense may be regarded as a
perturbed hydrogen atom. On the other hand, a clue to the
interpretation of the characteristic difference between the hydrogen spectrum and the spectra of other elements was first
obtained by Sommerfeld’s theory of the stationary states
of central systems referred to above. As shown by Sommerfeld, it is possible on this theory to account in general
outlines for the well known laws governing the frequencies of
the series spectra of the elements; and, as it will be shown in
Part III, it is also possible, on the basis of the formal relation
between the quantum theory and the ordinary theory of radiation, in this way to obtain a simple interpretation of the
laws governing the remarkable differences in the intensities
with which the various series of lines appear, which on the
combination principle would constitute the complete spectra under consideration. As regards the detailed discussion
of these spectra, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that
79
the part played by the inner electrons in the atoms of the
elements in question forms a far more intricate problem than
the perturbing effect of a fixed external field on the hydrogen
atom. For the treatment of this problem the theory of conditionally periodic systems based on the conditions (22) does
not seem to suffice, while, as it will be shown in Part III,
it appears that the method of perturbations exposed in the
following lends itself naturally also to this case.
