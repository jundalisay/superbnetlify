Part 1 showed that the problem of the fixation of the stationary states of a periodic system of several degrees of freedom, which is subject to the perturbing influence of a small external field, cannot be treated directly on the basis of the general principle of the mechanical transformability of the stationary states by considering the influence, which on ordinary mechanics a slow establishment of the external field would exert on the motion of some arbitrarily chosen stationary state of the undisturbed system (see Part I, page 41). 

This is an immediate consequence of the fact, mentioned in the former section, that the stationary states of the perturbed system are characterised by a greater number of extra-mechanical conditions than the stationary states of the undisturbed system. 

On the other hand, we were led to assume from the general formal relation between the quantum theory of line spectra and the ordinary theory of radiation, that it is possible to obtain information about the stationary states of the perturbed system from a direct consideration of
the slow variations which the periodic orbit undergoes as a consequence of the mechanical effect of the external field on
the motion. 

Thus, if these variations are of periodic or conditionally periodic type, we may expect that, in the presence of the external field, the values for the additional energy of the system in the stationary states are related to the small frequency or frequencies of the perturbations, in a manner analogous to the relation between energy and frequency in the stationary states of an ordinary periodic or conditionally
periodic system. 

If the equations of motion for the perturbed system can be solved by means of separation of variables, it is easily
seen that the relation in question is fulfilled if the stationary states are determined by the conditions (22). Consider thus
a system for which every orbit is periodic, and let us assume that in the presence of a given small external field a separation of variables is possible in a certain set of coordinates
q1, . . . , qs. For the undisturbed system we have then, according to equation (23), that the quantity I, defined by (5),
is equal to κ1I1 + · · · + κsIs, where I1, . . . , Is are defined
by (21) and calculated with respect to the set of coordinates
just mentioned, and where the κ’s are a set of entire positive
numbers without a common divisor. For simplicity let us
assume that at least one of the κ’s, say κs, is equal to one,
and that consequently, as mentioned on page 40, the number n in (24), which characterises the stationary states of
81
the undisturbed system, may take all positive values. This
condition will be fulfilled in case of all the applications to
spectral problems discussed below; it will be seen, however,
that the extension to problems where this condition is not
fulfilled will only necessitate small modifications in the following considerations. By use of (29) we get now for the
difference in the total energy of two slightly different states
of the perturbed system
δE =
Xs
1
ωk δIk = ωs
Xs
1
κk δIk +
Xs−1
1
(ωk − κkωs) δIk. (42)
Since for the undisturbed system ωk = κkωs, the differences
ωk − κkωs appearing in the last term will, for the perturbed
system, be small quantities which will just represent the frequencies of the slow variations which the orbit undergoes in
the presence of the external field. These quantities will in
the following be denoted by vk. Consider now the multitude of states of the perturbed system for which Ps
1
κkIk
is equal to nh, where n is a given entire positive number.
This multitude will be seen to include all possible stationary
states of the perturbed system, which satisfy (22), and the
motion of which differs at any moment only slightly from
some stationary motion of the undisturbed system, satisfying (24) for the given value of n. Denoting the value of the
energy of the undisturbed system in such a state by En, and
the value of the energy of the perturbed system in a state
belonging to the multitude under consideration by En + E,
82
we get from (42)
δE =
Xs−1
1
vk δIk (43)
for the energy difference between two neighbouring states of
this multitude. Since this relation has the same form as (29),
we see consequently that by putting I1, . . . , Is−1 equal to
entire multipla of h, as claimed by the conditions (22), we
obtain exactly the same relation between the additional energy E and the small frequencies vk, impressed on the system
by the external field, as that which holds between the total
energy and the fundamental frequencies in the stationary
states of a conditionally periodic system of s − 1 degrees of
freedom.
As a simple illustration of these calculations let us consider
the system consisting of a particle moving in a plane and subject
to an attraction from a fixed point, which varies proportional to
the distance apart. If undisturbed, the motion of this system will
be periodic independent of the initial conditions, and the particle will describe an elliptical orbit with its centre at the fixed
point. Moreover the equations of motion of the undisturbed system may be solved by means of separation of variables in polar
coordinates, as well as in any set of rectangular coordinates. In
the first case we have, taking for q1 the length of the radius vector from the fixed point to the particle and for q2 the angular
distance of this radius vector from a fixed direction, κ1 = 2 and
κ2 = 1, while in the second case we have κ1 = κ2 = 1. In the
presence of an external field the orbit will in general not remain
83
periodic, but will in the course of time cover a continuous extension of the plane. If the external field is sufficiently small,
however, the orbit will at any moment only differ little from a
closed elliptical orbit, but in the course of time the lengths and
directions of the principal axes of this ellipse will undergo slow
variations. In general the perturbed system will not allow of
separation of variables, but two cases obviously present themselves in which such a separation is still possible; in the first case
the external field is central with the fixed point as centre, and
a separation is possible in polar coordinates; in the second case
the external field of force is perpendicular to a given line and
varies as some function of the distance from this line, and separation is possible in a set of rectangular coordinates with the
axes parallel and perpendicular to the given line. In the first
case the perturbations will not affect the lengths of the principal
axes of the elliptical orbit and will only produce a slow uniform
rotation of the directions of these axes, while in the second case
the lengths of the principal axes as well as their directions will
perform slow oscillations. It will consequently be seen that, by
fixing the stationary states of the perturbed system by means of
the conditions (22), the cycles of shapes and positions which the
orbit of the particle will pass through in the stationary states will
be entirely different in the two cases. In both cases, however, it
will be seen that the frequency v = ω1 −κ1ω2 will be equal to the
frequency with which the orbit at regular intervals re-assumes
its shape and position. By fixing the stationary states by (22)
we obtain therefore, as seen from (43), in both cases that the
relation between this frequency and the additional energy of the
system due to the presence of the field will be the same as the
84
relation between energy and frequency in the stationary states of
a system of one degree of freedom; and it will be seen that the
above considerations offer a dynamical interpretation of the characteristic discontinuity involved in the application of the method
of separation of variables to the fixation of the stationary states
of perturbed periodic systems.1
)
In general it will not be possible to solve the equations
of motion of the perturbed system by means of separation of
variables in a fixed set of positional coordinates, but we shall
see that the problem of the fixation of the stationary states
of the perturbed system may be attacked by a direct examination of the additional energy of the system and its relation
1
) In this connection it may be of interest to note that the possibility
of a rational interpretation of the discontinuity in question would seem
to be essentially connected with the form of the principles of the quantum theory adopted in this paper. If for instance the quantum theory
is taken in the form proposed by Planck in his second theory of temperature radiation, the consequent development to periodic systems of
several degrees of freedom would seem to involve a serious difficulty
as regards the question of the necessary stability of the temperature
equilibrium among a great number of systems for small variations of
the external conditions. In fact, in connection with the development
of his theory of the “physical structure of the phase space”, mentioned
in Part I on page 31, in which conditions of the same type as (22) are
established, Planck has deduced expressions for the total energy of a
great number of systems in temperature equilibrium, which, if applied
to systems of the same kind as those considered in the above example,
show a dependency of this energy on the temperature which is different,
according to whether polar coordinates or rectangular coordinates are
used as basis for the structure of the phase space.
85
to the slow variations of the orbit, on the basis of the usual
theory of perturbations well known from celestial mechanics.
Consider a system for which every orbit, if undisturbed, is
periodic independent of the initial conditions, and let us assume that the equations of motion for some set of coordinates
q1, q2, . . . , qs are solved by means of the Hamilton-Jacobi
partial differential equation, given by formula (17) in Part I.
The motion of the system is then determined by the equations (18), and the orbit is characterised by means of the
constants α1, . . . , αs, β1, . . . , βs. If now the system is subject to some small external field of force, the motion will no
more be periodic, but, defining in the usual way the osculating orbit at a given moment as the periodic orbit which
would result if the external forces vanished suddenly at this
moment, we find that the constants α1, . . . , αs, β1, . . . , βs,
characterising the osculating orbit, will vary slowly with the
time. Assuming for the present that the external forces possess a constant potential Ω given as a function of the q’s, we
have according to the theory of perturbations that the rates
of variation of the orbital constants of the osculating orbit
will be given by1

86
functions of these quantities obtained by solving (18). The
equations (44) allow to follow completely the perturbing effect of the external field on the motion of the system. For
the problem under consideration, however, a detailed examination of the perturbations is not necessary. In fact, we
shall not be concerned with the small deformation of the
orbit characterised by the small oscillations of the orbital
constants within a time interval of the same order of magnitude as the period of the osculating orbit, but only with the
so called “secular perturbations” of the orbit, characterised
by the total variation of these constants taken over a time interval long compared with the period of the osculating orbit.
As we shall see below, these variations may, with an approximation sufficient for our purpose, be obtained directly
by taking mean values on both sides of the equations (44).
Before entering on these calculations, however, it may be observed that the part played by the constants α1 and β1 differs
essentially from that played by the other orbital constants
α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs. Thus from the formulæ (17) and
(18) on page 32, it follows that α1 is the total energy corresponding to the osculating orbit, while β1 will represent
the moment in which the system would pass some distinguished point in this orbit. If for instance we consider the
perturbations of a Keplerian motion, we may for β1 take the
so called time of perihelium passage. When discussing the
secular perturbations of the shape and position of the orbit,
we see therefore in the first place that the variations of β1
may be left out of consideration. Further, it follows from the
87
principle of conservation of energy, that α1 + Ω will remain
constant during the motion, and that consequently during
the perturbations α1 will change only by small quantities of
the same order as λα1, where λ denotes a small constant of
the same order of magnitude as the ratio between the external forces and the internal forces of the system. Moreover,
since the period σ of the undisturbed motion depends on
α1 only, it follows that the period of the osculating orbit will
remain constant during the perturbations, with neglect of
small quantities of the same order as λσ. On the other hand
it follows from (44) that, in a time interval of the same order
as σ/λ, the constants α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs will in general
undergo variations of the same order of magnitude as the
values of these constants themselves.
As mentioned above, the total variations of the constants
α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs, which characterise the secular perturbations of the shape and position of the orbit, may be
obtained by taking mean values on both sides of the equations (44). Introducing a function ψ of the α’s and β’s, equal
to the mean value of the potential Ω taken over a period σ
of the motion of the undisturbed system and defined by the
formula
ψ =
1
σ
Z t+σ
t
Ω dt, (45)
it is easily seen, since σ depends only on α1, that the mean
values of the partial differential coefficients of Ω with respect to α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs, taken over an approximate
period of the perturbed motion, may, if we look apart from
88
small quantities proportional to λ
2
, be replaced by the values
of the corresponding partial differential coefficients of ψ at
some moment within this period. With the approximation
mentioned we get therefore

Dt

∂ψ
∂βk

Dβk
Dt

∂αk
, (k = 2, . . . , s) (46)
where the differential symbols on the left sides are written to
indicate mean values of the rates of variation of the orbital
constants during an approximate period of the perturbed
motion. From the definition of ψ it follows that this quantity in general will depend on α1 as well as on α2, . . . , αs,
β2, . . . , βs, but that it will not depend upon β1. From the
above considerations it follows further that, with the approximation in question, α1 may be considered as a constant in
the expressions on the right sides of (46), while for α2, . . . ,
αs, β2, . . . , βs we may take a set of values corresponding to
some moment within the period to which the mean values
on the left sides refer.
It will be seen that the equations (46) allow to follow the
secular perturbations during a time interval sufficiently long
for the external forces to produce a considerable change in
the shape and position of the original orbit, if in the total
variations of the orbital constants α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs we
look apart from small quantities of the same order as the
small oscillations of these constants within a single period.
As a consequence of the secular variations, the orbit will pass
through a cycle of shapes and positions, which will depend
89
on its original shape and position and on the character of
the perturbing field, but not on the intensity of this field. In
fact, as seen from (46), the variations in the shape and position of the orbit will remain the same if ψ is multiplied by a
constant factor, which will only influence the rate at which
these variations are performed. It will further be observed
that the problem of determining the secular perturbations
by means of (46) consists in solving a set of equations of the
same type as the Hamiltonian equations of motion for a system of s−1 degrees of freedom. In these equations the quantity ψ plays formally the same part as the total energy in the
usual mechanical problem, and in analogy with the principle
of conservation of energy it follows directly from (46) that,
with neglect of small quantities proportional to λ
2
, the value
of ψ will remain constant during the perturbations, even if
the external forces act through a time interval of the same
order as σ/λ. In fact, with neglect of small quantities proportional to λ

, we have

Since at any moment ψ will differ only by small quantities proportional to λ
2
from the mean value of the potential
of the external forces taken over an approximate period of
the perturbed motion, it follows from the above that, with
90
neglect of small quantities of this order, also the mean value
of the inner energy α1 of the perturbed system, taken over
an approximate period, will remain constant during the perturbations, even if the perturbing forces act through a time
interval long enough to produce a considerable change in the
shape and position of the orbit. In the special case, where
the perturbed system allows of separation of variables, this
last result may be shown to follow directly from formula (28)
in Part I. Taking for the time interval ϑ in this formula the
period σ of the undisturbed motion, we get Nk = κk, where
κ1, . . . , κs are the numbers entering in formula (23). Comparing a given perturbed motion of the system with some
undisturbed motion of which it may be regarded as a small
variation, we get therefore from (28), with neglect of small
quantities proportional to the square of the intensity of the
external forces,
Z σ
0
δE dt =
Xs
1
κk δIk, (47)
where the I’s are calculated with respect to a set of coordinates in which a separation can be obtained for the perturbed
motion, and where δE is the difference between the total energy of the undisturbed motion and the energy which the
system would possess in its perturbed state, if the external
forces vanished suddenly at the moment under consideration, and which in the above calculations was denoted by α1.
Now the energy E of the undisturbed motion is determined
91
completely by the value of I =
PκkIk. If therefore the perturbed motion is all the time compared with a neighbouring
undisturbed motion of given constant energy, it follows directly from (47), that, with neglect of small quantities of the
same order as the square of the external forces, the integral
on the left side, taken over an approximate period of the
perturbed motion, will remain unaltered during the perturbations through any time interval, however long.
Before proceeding with the applications of the equations (46) which apply to the case of a constant perturbing
field, it will be necessary to consider the effect of a slow and
uniform establishment of the external field. Let us assume
that, within the interval 0 < t < ϑ where ϑ denotes a quantity of the same order as σ/λ, the intensity of the external
field increases uniformly from zero to the value corresponding to the potential Ω. Since the variation in the perturbing
field during a single period will only be a small quantity
of the same order as λ
2
, we see in the first place that the
secular variations of the constants α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs,
with the same approximation as for a constant field, will be
given by a set of equations of the same form as (46), with
the only difference that ψ is replaced by t
ϑ
ψ. Moreover it
may be shown that in these equations the quantity α1 may
be considered as constant, just as in the equations which
hold for a constant perturbing field. In fact the total variation in α1 at any moment t will be equal to the total work
performed by the external forces since the beginning of the
92
establishment of the perturbing field, and will therefore be
given by

, (48)
where the expression on the right side is obtained by partial
integration; but, since both terms in this expression are of
the same order of magnitude as λα1, we see that the total
variation in α1 within the interval in question will, just as
in case of a constant perturbing field, be only a small quantity of this order. We get therefore the result, that, for the
same shape and position of the original orbit, the cycle of
shapes and positions passed through by the orbit during the
increase of the external field will be the same as that which
would appear for a constant perturbing field, and that, with
neglect of small quantities proportional to λ
2
, the value of
the function ψ will consequently remain constant during the
establishment of the field. With this approximation we get
therefore from (48), putting t = ϑ,
∆ϑα1 + Ωϑ =
1
ϑ
Z ϑ
0
Ω dt = ψ,
which shows that the change in the total energy of the system, due to the slow and uniform establishment of the external field, is just equal to the value of the function ψ, and
consequently equal to the mean value of the potential of the
93
external forces taken over an approximate period of the perturbed motion. 

This result may also be expressed by stating, that, with neglect of small quantities proportional to
the square of the external forces, the mean value of the inner
energy taken over an approximate period of the perturbed
motion will be equal to the energy possessed by the system
before the establishment of the perturbing field.
Returning now to the problem of the fixation of the stationary states of a periodic system subject to the influence
of a small external field of constant potential, we shall base
our considerations on the fundamental assumption that these
states are distinguished between the continuous multitude of
mechanically possible states by a relation between the additional energy of the system due to the presence of the external field and the frequencies of the slow variations of the
orbit produced by this field, which is analogous to the relation discussed on page 80 in the special case in which the
perturbed system allows of separation of variables in a fixed
set of coordinates. On this assumption we shall expect in
the first place that, apart from small quantities proportional
to λ, the cycles of shapes and positions of the orbit belonging
to the stationary states of the perturbed system will depend
only on the character of the external field, but not on its intensity. Since now, as shown above, such a cycle will remain
unaltered during a slow and uniform increase of the intensity of the external field if the effect of the external forces is
calculated by means of ordinary mechanics, we are therefore,
with reference to the principle of the mechanical transforma-
94
bility of the stationary states, led to the conclusion that it
is possible by direct application of ordinary mechanics, not
only to follow the secular perturbations of the orbit in the
stationary states corresponding to a constant external field,
but also to calculate the variation in the energy of the system in the stationary states which results from a slow and
uniform change in the intensity of this field. If we denote the
energy in the stationary states of the perturbed system by
En + E, where En is the value of the energy in the stationary state of the undisturbed system characterised by a given
entire value of n in the condition I = nh, we may therefore
conclude from the above that the additional energy E in the
stationary states of the perturbed system will be equal to the
value in these states of the function ψ defined by (45), if we
look apart from small quantities proportional to the square of
the intensity of the external forces. It will be seen that this
result is equivalent to the statement, that the mean value
of the inner energy taken over an approximate period of the
perturbed motion will be equal to the value En of the energy
in the corresponding stationary state of the undisturbed system. In case of the perturbed system allowing of separation
of variables in a fixed set of coordinates, this result may be
simply shown to be a direct consequence of the fixation of
the stationary states by means of the conditions (22). In
fact, if we assume that the undisturbed motion, considered
in (47), corresponds to some stationary state, satisfying (24)
for a given value of n, and that the perturbed motion is also
stationary and satisfies (22), we see that the right side of (47)
95
will be zero, and we get the result that the mean value of the
inner energy in the stationary states of the system, with the
approximation mentioned, will not be altered in the presence
of the external field.
Due to the above result that the additional energy E in
the stationary states of the perturbed system, with neglect
of small quantities proportional to λ
2
, may be taken equal
to the value in these states of the function ψ entering in the
equations (46) which determine the secular perturbations of
the orbits, we are now able to draw further conclusions from
the fact, mentioned above, that these equations are of the
same type as the Hamiltonian equations of motion for a mechanical system of s − 1 degrees of freedom. In fact, we see
that the fixation of the stationary states of the perturbed system is reduced to a problem which is formally analogous to
the fixation of these states for a mechanical system of less
degrees of freedom. As it will appear from the following applications this problem may, quite independent of the possibility of separation of variables for the perturbed system,
be treated directly on the basis of the fundamental relation
between energy and frequency in the stationary states of periodic or conditionally periodic systems, discussed in Part I,
if only the solution of the equations (46) is of a periodic or
conditionally periodic character. In this connection it may
once more be emphasised that these equations, according
to the manner in which they were deduced, allow to follow
the secular perturbations only through a time interval of the
same order of magnitude as that sufficient for the external forces to produce a finite alteration in the shape and position of the orbit. With reference to the necessary stability of
the stationary states of an atomic system, it seems justified,
however, to conclude that any possible small discrepancy between the motion to be expected from a rigorous application
of ordinary mechanics and that determined by a calculation
of the secular perturbations, based on the equations (46),
cannot cause a material change in the character of the stationary states as fixed by a consideration of the periodicity
properties of these perturbations. On the other hand, from
the point of view of the general formal relation between the
quantum theory and the ordinary theory of radiation, we
must be prepared to find that the motion and the energy
in the stationary states of a perturbed periodic system, for
which we only know that the secular perturbations as determined by (46) are of conditionally periodic type, will not
be as sharply defined as the motion and the energy in the
stationary states of a conditionally periodic system for which
the equations of motion allow of a rigorous solution by means
of the method of separation of variables. Thus, if we consider a large number of similar atomic systems of the type in
question, we may be prepared to find that the values of the
additional energy in a given stationary state will for the different systems deviate from each other by small quantities;
but it must be expected that the values of the additional
energy for the large majority of systems will differ from the
value of ψ, as determined by the method indicated above,
only by small quantities proportional to λ
2
, and that only
97
for a small fraction (at most of the same order as λ
2
) of the
systems the values of the additional energy will show deviations from this value of ψ, which are of the same order
as λ.
As to the application of the preceding considerations to
special problems, it will be seen in the first place that in
case of a perturbed periodic system possessing two degrees of
freedom, as for instance that considered in the example on
page 82, the problem of the fixation of the stationary states
of the perturbed system in the presence of a small external
field allows of a general solution on the basis of the method
developed above, because in this case the secular perturbations will in general be simply periodic. In fact, in this case
the shape and position of the orbit are characterised by two
constants α2 and β2, and from the equations (46), which will
be analogous to the equations of motion of a system of one
degree of freedom, it follows directly that during the perturbations α2 will be a function of β2 and that in general
these quantities will be periodic functions of the time with
a period s which, besides on α1, will depend on the value
of ψ only. Considering two slightly different states of the
perturbed system for which the corresponding states of the
undisturbed system (i. e. the states which would appear if
the external forces vanished at a slow and uniform rate) possess the same energy and consequently the same value for
the quantity I defined by (5), we get therefore by a calculation completely analogous to that leading to relation (8)
98
in Part I, which was deduced directly from the Hamiltonian
equations, for the difference in the values of the function ψ
for these two states
δψ = v δI, (49)
where v =
1
s
is the frequency of the secular perturbations,
and where the quantity I is defined by
I =
Z s
0
α2
Dβ2
Dt
dt =
Z
α2 Dβ2, (50)

where the latter integral is taken over a complete oscillation
of β2. In order to fix the stationary states, it will now be
seen in the first place that, among the multitude of states
of the perturbed system for which the value of I in the corresponding states of the undisturbed system is equal to nh
where n is a given positive integer, the state for which I = 0
must beforehand be expected to be a stationary state. In
fact, for this value of I, the shape and position of the orbit
will not undergo secular perturbations but will remain unaltered for a constant external field as well as during a slow
and uniform establishment of this field. In contrast to what
in general will take place during a slow establishment of the
external field, we may therefore expect that, for this special
shape and position of the orbit, a direct application of ordinary mechanics will be legitimate in calculating the effect
of the establishment of the field, since there will in this case
obviously be nothing to cause the coming into play of some
non-mechanical process, connected with the mechanism of


a transition between two stationary states accompanied by
the emission or absorption of a radiation of small frequency.
With reference to relation (49) we see therefore that, by fixing the stationary states of the perturbed system by means
of the condition
I = nh, (51)
where n is an entire number, we obtain a relation between
the additional energy E = ψ of the system in the presence
of the field and the frequency v of the secular perturbations,
which is exactly of the same type as that which holds between the energy and frequency in the stationary states of a
system of one degree of freedom, and which is expressed by
(8) and (10). By means of (51) it is possible, with neglect of
small quantities proportional to the square of the perturbing forces, directly to determine the value of the additional
energy in the stationary states of a periodic system of two
degrees of freedom subject to an arbitrarily given small external field of force, and consequently with this approximation, by use of the fundamental relation (1), to determine
the effect of this field on the frequencies of the spectrum of
the undisturbed periodic system. In general this effect will
consist in a splitting up of each of the spectral lines into a
number of components which are displaced from the original
position of the line by small quantities proportional to the
intensity of the external forces.
When we pass to perturbed periodic systems of more than
two degrees of freedom, the general problem is more com-
100
plex. For a given external field, however, it may be possible
to choose a set of orbital constants α2, . . . , αs, β2, . . . , βs
in such a way, that during the motion every of the β’s will
depend on the corresponding β only, while every of the β’s
will oscillate between two fixed limits. From analogy with
the theory of ordinary conditionally periodic systems which
allow of separation of variables, the perturbations may in
such a case be said to be conditionally periodic, and, from a
calculation quite analogous to that leading to equation (29)
in Part I which is based entirely on the use of the Hamiltonian equations, we get for the difference in ψ for two slightly
different states of the perturbed system, for which the value
of I in the corresponding states of the undisturbed system
is the same,

where vk is the mean frequency of oscillation of βk+1 between
its limits, and where the quantities Ik are defined by
Ik =
Z
αk+1 Dβk+1, (k = 1, . . . , s − 1) (53)
where the integral is taken over a complete oscillation of βk+1.
In analogy with the expression (31) for the displacements of
the particles of an ordinary conditionally periodic system
which allows of separation of variables, we get further in the
present case that every of the α’s and β’s may be expressed
as a function of the time by a sum of harmonic vibrations of

small frequencies

where the C’s and c’s are constants, the former of which, besides on I, depend on the I’s only, and where the summation
is to be extended over all positive and negative entire values
of the t’s. If therefore the secular perturbations are conditionally periodic, we may conclude that the stationary states
of the perturbed system, corresponding to a given stationary
state of the undisturbed system, will be characterised by the
s − 1 conditions
Ik = nkh, (k = 1, . . . , s − l) (55)
where n1, . . . , ns−1 form a set of entire numbers. In fact,
as seen from (52), we obtain in this way a relation between
the additional energy and the frequencies of the secular perturbations of exactly the same type as that holding for the
energy and frequencies of ordinary conditionally periodic systems and expressed by (22) and (29); moreover we may conclude beforehand that the state in which every of the quantities Ik, defined by (53), is equal to zero must belong to the
stationary states of the perturbed system, because in this
case the orbit will not undergo secular perturbations for a
constant external field, nor during a slow and uniform establishment of this field. Since the conditions (55), with neglect
102
of small quantities proportional to the square of the intensities of the external forces, allow to determine the additional
energy of the system due to the presence of the external field,
we see therefore that the effect of this field on the spectrum
of the undisturbed system, if the secular perturbations are
conditionally periodic, will consist in a splitting up of each
spectral line in a number of components, in analogy with
the effect of a perturbing field on the spectrum of a periodic system of two degrees of freedom. In general, however,
the perturbations, which a periodic system of more than two
degrees of freedom undergoes in the presence of a given external field, cannot be expected to be conditionally periodic
and to exhibit periodicity properties of the type expressed
by formula (54). In such cases it seems impossible to define
stationary states in a way which leads to a complete fixation
of the total energy in these states, and we are therefore led
to the conclusion, that the effect of the external field on the
spectrum will not consist in the splitting up of the spectral
lines of the original system into a number of sharp components, but in a diffusion of these lines over spectral intervals
of a width proportional to the intensity of the external forces.
In special cases in which the secular perturbations of a
perturbed periodic system of more than two degrees of freedom are of conditionally periodic type, it may occur that
these perturbations are characterised by a number of fundamental frequencies, which is less than s − 1. In such cases,
in which the perturbed periodic system from analogy with
the terminology used in Part I may be said to be degener-
103
ate, the necessary relation between the additional energy and
the frequencies of the secular perturbations is secured by a
number of conditions less than that given by (55), and the
stationary states are consequently characterised by a number of conditions less than s. With a typical example of such
systems we meet if, for a perturbed periodic system of more
than two degrees of freedom, the secular perturbations are
simply periodic independent of the initial shape and position
of the orbit. In direct analogy to what holds for perturbed
periodic systems of two degrees of freedom, the difference
between the values of ψ in two slightly different states of the
perturbed system, corresponding to the same value of I, will
in the present case be given by
δψ = v δI, (56)
where v is the frequency of the secular perturbations, and
where I is defined by
I =
Z v

dt, (57)
where s = 1/v is the period of the perturbations. We may
therefore conclude that the stationary states of the perturbed
system, corresponding to a given stationary state of the
undisturbed system, will be characterised by the single condition
I = nh, (58)
104
in which n is an entire number, and which will be seen to
be completely analogous to the condition which fixes the stationary states of ordinary periodic systems of several degrees
of freedom.
In the following sections we shall apply the preceding considerations to the problem of the fixation of the stationary
states of the hydrogen atom, when the relativity modifications are taken into account, and when the atom is exposed
to small external fields. In this discussion we shall for the
sake of simplicity consider the mass of the nucleus as infinite in the calculations of the perturbations of the orbit of
the electron. This involves, in the expression for the additional energy of the system, the neglect of small terms of
the same order as the product of the intensity of the external forces with the ratio between the mass of the electron
and the mass of the nucleus, but due to the smallness of the
latter ratio the error introduced by this simplification will
be of no importance in the comparison of the results with
the measurements. Since in the case under consideration
the system possesses three degrees of freedom, the equations
which determine the secular perturbations of the orbit of
the electron will correspond to the equations of motion of a
system of two degrees of freedom, and it will therefore not
be possible to give a general treatment of the problem of the
stationary states. Thus, for any given external field, we meet
with the question whether the perturbations are conditionally periodic and, if so, in what set of orbital constants this
105
periodicity may be conveniently expressed. Now, in many
spectral problems, the external field possesses axial symmetry round an axis through the nucleus, and in this case it is
easily shown that the problem of the fixation of the stationary states allows of a general solution. A choice of orbital
constants which is suitable for the discussion of this problem, and which is well known from the astronomical theory
of planetary perturbations, is obtained by choosing for α2
the total angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus and for α3 the component of this angular momentum
round the axis of the field. For the set of β’s, corresponding
to this set of α’s, we may take β2 equal to the angle, which
the major axis makes with the line in which the plane of
the orbit cuts the plane through the nucleus perpendicular
to the axis of the field, and β3 equal to the angle between
this line and a fixed direction in the latter plane. For the
problem under consideration it will be seen that, with this
choice of constants, the mean value ψ of the potential of
the perturbing field will, besides on α1, generally depend on
α2 and β2 as well as on α3, but due to the symmetry round
the axis it will obviously not depend on β3. In consequence
of this, the equations (46), which determine the secular perturbations, will possess the same form as the Hamiltonian
equations of motion for a particle moving in a plane and
subject to a central field of force. Thus corresponding to the
conservation of angular momentum for central systems, we
get in the first place from (46) that α3 will remain unaltered
during the perturbations. Next corresponding to the simple
106
periodicity of the radial motion in central systems, we see
from (46), if α3 as well as α1 is considered as a constant,
that during the perturbations α2 will be a function of β2 and
vary in a simple periodic way with the time. The perturbations of the orbit of the electron produced by an external
field which possesses axial symmetry will therefore always be
of conditionally periodic type, quite independent of the possibility of separation of variables for the perturbed system.
As regards the form of the conditions which fix the stationary states, it may be noted, however, that with the choice of
orbital constants under consideration the β’s will not, as it
was assumed for the sake of simplicity in the general discussion on page 100, oscillate between fixed limits, but it will be
seen that β2 during the perturbations may either oscillate between two such limits or increase (or decrease) continuously,
while β3 will always vary in the latter manner. This constitutes, however, only a formal difficulty of the same kind as
that mentioned in Part I in connection with the discussion
of the conditions (16), which fix the stationary states of a
system consisting of a particle moving in a central field of
force. Thus from a simple consideration it will be seen that,
in complete analogy to the relations (52) and (53), we get
in the present case for the difference between the energy of
two slightly different states of the perturbed system, which
correspond to the same value of I,
δψ = v1 δI1 + v2 δI2, (59)
where v1 is the frequency with which the shape of the or-
107
bit and its position relative to the axis of the field repeats
itself at regular intervals and which is characterised by the
variation of α2 and β2, while v2 is the mean frequency of rotation of the plane of the orbit round this axis characterised
by the variation of β3, and where I1 and I2 are defined by
the equations
I1 =
Z
α2 Dβ2, I2 =
Z 2π
0
α3 Dβ3 = 2πα3. (60)
In case β2 varies in an oscillating manner with the time, the
first integral must be taken over a complete oscillation of
this orbital constant, while, if β2 during the perturbations
increases or decreases continuously, the integral in the expression for I1 must be taken over an interval of 2π, just
as the integral in the expression for I2. By fixing the stationary states of the perturbed system by means of the two
conditions1
)
I1 = n1h, I2 = n2h, (61)
1
) Quite apart from the problem of perturbed periodic systems, the
second of these conditions would also follow directly from certain interesting considerations of Epstein (Ber. d. D. Phys. Ges. XIX, p. 116
(1917)) about the stationary states of systems which allow of what may
be called “partial separation of variables”. In this case it is possible to
choose a set of positional coordinates q1, . . . , qs in such a way that, for
some of the coordinates, the conjugated momenta may be considered as
functions of the corresponding q’s only, so that, for these coordinates,
quantities I may be defined by (21) in the same way as for systems
for which a complete separation of variables can be obtained. From
analogy with the theory of the stationary states of the latter systems,
108
where n1 and n2 are entire numbers, it will therefore be seen
that we obtain the right relation between the additional energy E = ψ of the perturbed atom and the frequencies of
the secular perturbations of the orbit of the electron. It will
moreover be seen that a state in which the electron moves
in a circular orbit perpendicular to the axis of the field, and
which beforehand must be expected to belong to the stationary states of the perturbed atom since this orbit will not
undergo secular perturbations during a uniform establishment of the external field, will be included among the states
determined by (61). In fact, if n is the number which characterises the corresponding stationary state of the undisturbed
system, this state of the perturbed system will correspond
to n1 = 0, n2 = n or to n1 = n, n2 = n, according to
whether β2 during the perturbations oscillates between fixed
limits, or increases (or decreases) continuously. As regards
the application of the conditions (61) it is of importance to
point out that, from considerations of the invariance of the
a-priori probability of the stationary states of an atomic sysEpstein proposes therefore the assumption, that some of the conditions to be fulfilled in the stationary states of the systems in question
may be obtained by putting the I’s thus defined equal to entire multipla of h. It will be seen that, in case of systems possessing an axis
of symmetry, this leads to the second of the conditions (61), which
expresses the condition that in the stationary states the total angular
momentum round the axis must be equal to an entire multiple of h/2π.
As pointed out in Part I on page 64, this condition would also seem to
obtain an independent support from considerations of conservation of
angular momentum during a transition between two stationary states.
109
tem during continuous transformations of the external conditions (see Part I, page 14 and page 49), it seems necessary
to conclude that no stationary state exists corresponding to
n2 = 0. For this value of n2 the motion of the electron would
take place in a plane through the axis, but for certain external fields such motions cannot be regarded as physically
realisable stationary states of the atom, since in the course of
the perturbations the electron would collide with the nucleus
(compare page 134).
A special case of an external field possessing axial symmetry, in which the secular perturbations are very simple,
presents itself if the external forces form a central field with
the nucleus at the centre. In this case the solution of the
problem of the fixation of the stationary states is given by
Sommerfeld’s general theory of central systems, discussed
in Part I, which rests upon the fact that these systems allow
of separation of variables in polar coordinates. In connection
with the above considerations it may be of interest, however,
to consider the problem in question directly from the point
of view of perturbed periodic systems, because it presents a
characteristic example of a degenerate perturbed system. In
the present case ψ will, besides on α1, depend on α2 only,
and from the equations (46) we get therefore the well known
result, that the angular momentum of the electron and the
plane of its orbit will not vary during the perturbations, and
that the only secular effect of the perturbing field will consist
in a slow uniform rotation of the direction of the major axis.

For the frequency of this rotation we get from (46)
v =

Dβ2

, (62)
from which we get directly for the difference between the values of ψ for two neighbouring states of the perturbed system,
for which the corresponding value of I is the same,
δψ = 2πv δα2. (63)
This relation, which corresponds to (56), is seen to coincide
with (59), since in the present case v2 = 0 and I1 = 2πα2.
From (63) it follows that the necessary relation between the
additional energy of the atom and the frequency of the perturbations is secured if the stationary states in the presence
of a small external central field are characterised by the condition
I = 2πα2 = nh, (64)
where n is an entire number. This condition, which is equivalent with the second of Sommerfeld’s conditions (16),
corresponds to (58) and is seen to coincide with the first of
the conditions (61), while the second of the latter conditions
in the special case under consideration loses its validity corresponding to the fact that the orientation of the plane of the
orbit in space is obviously arbitrary. Since, for a Keplerian
motion, the major axis of the orbit depends on the total energy only while the minor axis is proportional to the angular
momentum, it will be seen from (64) that the presence of
111
a small external field imposes the restriction on the motion
of the atom in the stationary states, that the minor axis of
the orbit of the electron must be equal to an entire multiple
of the n
th part of the major axis, which was given by 2αn
in (41). This result has been pointed out by Sommerfeld
as a consequence of the application of the conditions (16).
In the preceding it has been shown how it is possible to
attack the problem of the stationary states of a perturbed periodic system by an examination of the secular perturbations
of the shape and position of the orbit, and to fix these states
if the perturbations are of periodic or conditionally periodic
type. While these considerations allow to determine the possible values for the total energy of the perturbed system and
thereby the frequencies of the components into which the
lines of the spectrum of the undisturbed system are split up
in the presence of the external field, it is necessary, however, for the discussion of the intensities and polarisations
of these components to consider more closely the motion of
the particles in the perturbed system and the relation of the
total energy of this system to the fundamental frequencies
which characterise the motion. In the first place it will be
seen that, if the secular perturbations as determined by the
equations (46) are of conditionally periodic type, the displacements of the particles of the system in any given direction may, with neglect of small quantities proportional to
the intensity of the external forces, be represented, within a
time interval sufficiently large for these forces to produce a
112
considerable change in the shape and position of the orbit,
as a sum of harmonic vibrations by expressions of the type:
ξ =
XCτ,t1,..., ts−1
cos 2π

(τωP + t1v1 + · · ·
+ ts−1vs−1)t + cτ,t1,..., ts−1
	
,
(65)
where the summation is to be extended over all positive
and negative entire values of τ , t1, . . . , ts−1, and where the
C’s and c’s are two sets of constants, the former of which
depend only on the values of the quantities I1, . . . , Is−1 defined by (53) and on the value of the quantity I, which characterises the corresponding state of the undisturbed system
which would appear if the external field vanished at a slow
and uniform rate. While the quantities v1, . . . , vs−1 are the
same as those which appear in the formula (54), and represent the small frequencies of the secular perturbations of
the shape and position of the orbit, the quantity ωP may be
considered as representing the mean frequency of revolution
of the particles in their approximately periodic orbit. As regards the total energy of the perturbed system, it may next
be proved that, looking apart from small quantities proportional to the square of the intensity of the external forces, the
difference in the total energy in two slightly different states
of the perturbed system, for which the values of I, I1, . . . ,
Is−1 differ by δI, δI1, . . . , δIs−1 respectively, is given by the
relation1

δE = ωP δI +
Xs−1

vk δIk, (66)
113
which coincides with (52) if δI = 0, and which will be seen to
1
) From a comparison with formula (8), holding for the energy difference between two neighbouring states of the undisturbed system,
and with formula (52), it will be seen that (66) implies the condition
ωP = ω + ∂ψ/∂I, where ω is the frequency of revolution in the corresponding state of the undisturbed system characterised by the given
value of I, and where, in the partial differential coefficient, ψ is considered as a function of I and I1, . . . , Is−1. This relation can be verified
by means of a consideration based on the perturbation equations (44),
which takes into account the simple relation between α1 and I for the
undisturbed system, as well as the relation between the mean rate of
variation of β1 with the time and the difference between ωP and ω.
We shall not enter, however, on the details of the rather intricate calculations involved in such a consideration, since the problems in question allow of a more elegant treatment by means of another analytical
method. Thus it will be shown by Mr. H. A. Kramers, in the paper
mentioned in the end of § 4, that, quite independent of the possibility of separation of variables for the perturbed system in a fixed set
of positional coordinates, the theory of secular perturbations exposed
in this section offers—if these perturbations as determined by (46) are
of conditionally periodic type—a means of disclosing a set of angle
variables, which may be used to describe the motion of the perturbed
system with the same degree of approximation as that involved in the
preceding calculations. According to the definition of angle variables,
mentioned in the Note on page 53 in Part I, this means that it is possible, in stead of the positional coordinates q1, . . . , qs of the perturbed
system and their conjugated momenta p1, . . . , ps to introduce a new
set of s variables in such a way, that the q’s and p’s are periodic in
every of the new variables with period 1, when they are considered
as functions of these variables and of their canonically conjugated momenta. These momenta will just coincide with the quantities denoted
above by I, I1, . . . , Is−1, and the corresponding angle variables may
114
be completely analogous with formula (29) in Part I, holding
for an ordinary conditionally periodic system which allows
of separation of variables in a fixed set of positional coordinates; just as (65) is analogous to formula (31) representing
the displacements of the particles for such a system. Since
moreover, in complete analogy to the conditions (22), the
stationary states of the perturbed system are characterised
by
I = nh, Ik = nkh, (k = 1, . . . , s − 1) (67)
we see consequently that, for sufficiently small intensity of
the external forces, we obtain in the region of large values of n
and of the n’s a connection between the frequencies of the
components of the spectral lines, determined on the quantum
conveniently be denoted by w, w1, . . . , ws−1 respectively. Introducing
the new variables, the total energy of the perturbed system will be a
function of I, I1, . . . , Is−1 only, if we look apart from small quantities
proportional to λ
2
. With this approximation we get consequently by a
calculation, analogous to that given in the Note referred to, that the
angle variables w, w1, . . . , ws−1 may be represented as linear functions
of the time within an interval of the same order as σ/λ. Denoting the
rates of variation of w, w1, . . . , ws−1 by ω, v1, . . . , vs−1 respectively,
the formulæ (65) and (66) are therefore directly obtained, just as the
corresponding formulæ (31) and (29) in Part I. In this connection it
will be observed that, due to the possibility of introduction of angle
variables, the conditions (67) appear in the same form as that in which
the conditions, which fix the stationary states of ordinary conditionally periodic systems which allow of separation of variables, have been
formulated by Schwarzschild, and which, as mentioned in the Note
in Part I, has already been applied by Burgers to certain systems for
which such a separation cannot be obtained.
115
theory by means of relation (1), and those to be expected on
ordinary electrodynamics, which is of exactly the same type
as the analogous connection, discussed in Part I, in case of
ordinary conditionally periodic systems which allow of separation of variables. In perfect analogy with the general considerations in Part I, we are therefore led directly to certain
simple conclusions as regards the intensities and polarisations of the components into which the lines of the spectrum
of the undisturbed periodic system are split up in the presence of the external field. Thus we shall expect that there
will exist an intimate connection between the probability of
spontaneous transition between two stationary states of the
perturbed system, for which n = n

respectively, and the values in these states of the coefficient Cτ,t1,..., ts−1
in the expressions for the displacements
of the particles, for which τ = n

.
If for instance, for a certain set of values of τ and t1, . . . ,
ts−1, the coefficient Cτ,t1,..., ts−1
in the expressions for the displacements in every direction will be equal to zero for all
motions of the perturbed system, we shall expect that the
corresponding transitions between two stationary states will
be impossible in the presence of the given external field; and
if this coefficient is zero for the displacements of the particles in a certain direction only, we shall expect that the
corresponding transitions will give rise to the emission of a
radiation which is polarised in a plane perpendicular to this
direction.
With a characteristic example of these considerations we
116
meet in the case of the spectrum of a hydrogen atom exposed
to an external field of force which possesses axial symmetry
round an axis through the nucleus. In analogy with the
resolution of the motion of an ordinary conditionally periodic system which possesses an axis of symmetry in its constituent harmonic vibrations, discussed in Part I on page 61,
it follows from the discussion of the general character of the
secular perturbations on page 104 that the motion of the
electron in the perturbed atom in this case can be resolved
in a number of linear harmonic vibrations parallel to the axis
with frequencies τωP + t1v1 and in a number of circular harmonic rotations perpendicular to the axis with frequencies
τωP +t1v1+v2. In complete analogy with the considerations
in Part I, we are therefore led to conclude that in the present
case only two types of transitions between the stationary
states of the perturbed atom are possible. In the transitions
of the first type n2 will remain unaltered and the emitted
radiation will give rise to components of the hydrogen lines
which will show linear polarisation parallel to the axis. In the
transitions of the second type n2 will change by one unit and
the emitted radiation will show circular polarisation when
viewed in the direction of the axis. Remembering that, according to the conditions (61), the angular momentum of
the system round the axis in the stationary states is equal
to n2
h
2π
, it will be seen moreover that, also in the present
case, these conclusions obtain an independent support from
a consideration of conservation of angular momentum during
117
the transitions (Compare Part I page 64).1
) In the following
we will meet with applications of these considerations when
discussing the effect of electric and magnetic fields on the
hydrogen lines. In the latter case, however, the preceding
considerations need some modifications due to the fact, that
the external forces acting on the electron cannot be derived
from a potential expressed as a function of its positional coordinates; to this point we shall come back in § 5.
Before leaving the general theory of perturbed periodic
systems we shall still consider the problem of the effect on
the spectrum of a periodic system, undergoing secular perturbations of conditionally periodic type under the influence
of a given small external field, if this system is further subject to the influence of a second external field which is small
compared with the first field, but the perturbing effect of

) Note added during the proof. In an interesting paper by A. Rubinowicz (Phys. Zeitschr. XIX, p. 441 and p. 465 (1918)) which has just
been published, a similar consideration of conservation of angular momentum has been used to draw conclusions, as regards the possibility
of transitions between the stationary states of a conditionally periodic
system possessing an axis of symmetry, and as regards the character
of the polarisation of the radiation accompanying these transitions. In
this way Rubinowicz has arrived at several of the results discussed
in the present paper; in this connection, however, it may be remarked
that, from a consideration of conservation of angular momentum, it is
not possible, even for systems possessing axial symmetry, to obtain as
complete information, as regards the number and polarisation of the
possible components, as from a consideration based on the resolution
of the motion of the electron in harmonic vibrations.
118
which is yet large compared with the small effects on the
motion, proportional to the square of the intensity of the
first perturbing field, which were neglected in the preceding calculations. This problem is closely analogous to the
problem, briefly discussed in Part I, of the effect of a small
perturbing field on the spectrum of an ordinary conditionally periodic system which allows of separation of variables.
As mentioned on page 64, we have in this case, quite independent of the possibility of separation of variables for the
perturbed system, that in general the motion under the influence of the external field may still be represented as a sum
of harmonic vibrations by a formula of the type (31), if we
look apart from small terms proportional to the square of
the perturbing forces. Corresponding to this we have in the
case under consideration that, independent of the nature of
the second external field, the resultant secular perturbations
may in general be expressed as a sum of harmonic vibrations
of small frequencies of the type (54), if we look apart from
small terms of the same order as the product of the secular
perturbations produced by the first external field with the
square of the ratio between the intensities of the forces due
to the first and those due to the second external field. Let
us denote this ratio by µ and let, as above, λ represent a
small constant of the same order as the ratio between the
external forces due to the first field and the internal forces
of the system. On the basis of the general relation between
energy and frequency in the stationary states, we may then
expect that it is possible to fix the motion in these states
119
for the perturbed periodic system in the presence of both
external fields with neglect of small terms of the same order as the largest of the quantities µ
2 and λ, and to fix the
corresponding values for the energy with neglect of small
terms of the same order as the largest of the quantities λµ2
and λ
2
.

) In general, however, the effect on the spectrum of
the perturbed system, produced by the second external field,
may be calculated without considering the perturbing effect
of this field in detail. In fact, it is in general possible, by
means of the principle of the mechanical transformability of
the stationary states, with the approximation mentioned to
determine the alteration of the energy of the system, due to
the presence of the second external field, directly from the
character of the secular perturbations produced by the first
external field only. Thus let us assume that the second field
is slowly established at a uniform rate within a time interval
of the same order of magnitude as that in which the system
will pass approximately through any state belonging to the
cycle of shapes and positions, which the orbit passes through
in the stationary states in the presence of the first external
field only. Denoting a time interval of this order by ϑ and
1
) In analogy with the considerations on page 97 it may be expected,
however, that these limits for the definition of the energy in the stationary states will hold only for the great majority among a large number
of atomic systems. Thus in the present case we must be prepared to
find that for a small fraction of the systems of the same order as µ
2
(if µ
2 > λ) the energy will differ from that fixed by the method under
consideration by small quantities of the same order as µλ.
120
the potential of the first perturbing field by Ω and that of the
second by ∆Ω, we get then, by a calculation quite analogous
to that given in Part I on page 17 for the alteration in the
mean value of the energy of a periodic system during a slow
establishment of a small external field, that the alteration
in the mean value of α1 + Ω taken over a time interval of
the same order as ϑ, due to the establishment of the second
external field, will be a small quantity of the same order of
magnitude as ϑ(∆Ω)2
; but with the notation used above this
means, in general, a small quantity of the same order as λµ2
.
It follows consequently that, with this approximation, the alteration in the energy in a given stationary state, due to the
presence of the second perturbing field, is equal to the mean
value of the potential of this field taken over the cycle of
shapes and positions, which the orbit would pass through in
the corresponding stationary state of the perturbed system
under the influence of the first external field only. In general,
the effect on the spectrum will therefore consist in a small
displacement of the original components proportional to the
intensity of the forces due to the second perturbing field; and
as regards the degree of approximation with which these displacements are defined, it will be seen from the above that,
if µ is smaller than √
λ, the fixation of the energy in the
stationary states in the presence of the second external field,
and therefore also the determination of the frequencies of the
spectral lines by means of (1), allow of the same degree of
approximation as the fixation of the energy in the stationary
states of the original perturbed periodic system. If µ is larger
121
than √
λ, however, the stationary states will in general not
be as well defined as for the original system, and from relation (1) we may therefore expect that the components will
be diffuse, although, as long as µ remains small compared
with unity, the width of the components will remain small
compared with the displacements from their positions in the
presence of the first external field alone. Only when µ becomes of the same order as unity, the simultaneous effect of
both perturbing fields may be expected to consist in a diffusion of the lines of the undisturbed periodic system; unless
of course the secular perturbations due to the simultaneous
presence of both fields are still of conditionally periodic type,
as it may happen in special problems. In certain cases the
second external field will not only give rise to small displacements of the original components but also to the appearance
of new components of small intensities proportional to µ
2
.
This occurs if for the original perturbed periodic system, due
to some peculiarity of the motion, some of the coefficients
Cτ,t1,..., ts−1
in the expressions (65) for the displacements of
the particles as a sum of harmonic vibrations, corresponding to certain combinations of the numbers τ , t1, . . . , ts−1,
are equal to zero, while in the presence of the second external field these coefficients are small quantities proportional
to µ (compare Part I, page 64).1
) In the preceding con1

new components will be determined, we must be prepared to find that
the frequencies of these components are only defined with neglect of
small quantities proportional to λµ. Compare the detailed discussion

siderations it has been assumed that the perturbed system
in the presence of the first external field is non-degenerate.
In case, however, this system is degenerate, it is obviously
impossible, by a direct application of the principle of the
mechanical transformability of the stationary states, to determine the alteration in the energy in the stationary states
of the system, which will be due to the presence of a second
external field small compared with the first field; because,
as mentioned, the stationary states of the system, in the
presence of this field only, will be determined by a number
of conditions which is less than the number s of degrees of
freedom, and that consequently the cycles of shapes and positions, which the orbit will pass through in these states, will
not be completely determined. For the calculation of the energy in the stationary states it will therefore be necessary to
consider the secular perturbing effect of the second external
field on these cycles. In the special case where the secular
perturbations due to the first field are simply periodic, it
wall in this way be seen that the problem of the fixation of
the stationary states in the presence of the second external
field, by means of the method exposed in this section, may
be reduced to the problem of the fixation of the stationary
states of a system of s − 2 degrees of freedom. If, as in the
applications considered below, s is equal to 3, this problem
allows of a general solution, and we must therefore expect
that in this case the effect on the spectrum of the perturbed
of the example in § 5 on page 192.
123
system produced by an arbitrary second external field, which
is small compared with the first, will consist in the splitting
up of every component into a number of separate components, just as the effect of an arbitrary small external field
on the lines of the spectrum of a simple periodic system of
two degrees of freedom. We will meet with applications of
the above considerations when considering the effect on the
hydrogen spectrum of the combined action of different external fields and when considering the effect of an external
field on the spectra of other elements, which latter problem
will be discussed in Part III.
§ 3. The fine structure of the hydrogen lines.
An instructive application of the calculations in the last
section may be made in connection with the fine structure
of the hydrogen lines, which, according to Sommerfeld’s
theory mentioned in Part I on page 31, may be explained by
taking into account the small variation of the mass of the
electron with its velocity, claimed by the theory of relativity.
In this connection it must first of all be remarked that all the
general considerations in the preceding sections, as regards
relations between energy and frequency and as regards the
mechanical transformability of the stationary states, hold
unaltered if the relativity modifications are taken into account. This follows from the fact that the Hamiltonian equations (4), which are taken as a basis for all the previous calculations, may be used to describe the motion also in this case.
124
If, when the relativity modifications are taken into account,
the motion of the system is simply periodic independent of
the initial conditions, we shall consequently expect that the
stationary states are characterised by the condition I = nh
only, and that the energy and frequency are the same for all
states corresponding to a given value of n in this equation.
Further the stationary states will also in the relativity case
be fixed by (22), if the system is conditionally periodic and
allows of separation of variables; while the stationary states
of a perturbed periodic system, also in the relativity case,
will be characterised by the conditions (67), if the secular
perturbations are of conditionally periodic type.
Now, when the relativity modifications are taken into account, the motion of the particles in the hydrogen atom will
not, as assumed in § 1, be exactly periodic, but the orbit of
the electron will be of the same type as that, which would
appear on ordinary Newtonian mechanics, if the law of attraction between the particles differed slightly from that of
the inverse square. If, for the moment, we consider the mass
of the nucleus as infinite, the system will allow of a separation of variables in polar coordinates, and the stationary
states may consequently be fixed by the conditions (16). In
this way Sommerfeld obtained an expression for the total
energy in the stationary states, which, with neglect of small
quantities of higher order than the square of the ratio of the
velocity of the electron and the velocity of light c, is given

where, as in the calculations in § 1, the charge and the mass
of the electron are denoted by −e and m, and for sake of generality the charge of the nucleus by Ne. Further n1 and n2
are the integers appearing on the right side of the conditions (16) as factors to Planck’s constant. While n1 may
take the values 0, 1, 2, . . . , it will be seen that n2 can only
take the values 1, 2, . . . , because in the present case there
will obviously not correspond any stationary state to n2 = 0,
since in such a state the electron would collide with the nucleus. Introducing the experimental values for e, h and c,
it is found that e
2/hc is a small quantity of the same order as 10−3
; and, unless N is large number, the second term
within the bracket on the right side of (68) will consequently
be very small compared with unity. Putting n1 + n2 = n, it
will further be seen that the factor outside the bracket will
coincide with the expression for Wn given by (41) in § 1, if we
look apart from the small correction due to the finite mass of
the nucleus. Due to the presence of the second term within
the bracket, we thus see that, for any value of n, formula (68)

a direct application of the condition I = nh to these periodic motions.
126
gives a set of values for E which differ slightly from each
other and from −Wn. Sommerfeld’s theory leads therefore
to a direct explanation of the fact, that the hydrogen lines,
when observed by instruments of high dispersive power, are
split up in a number of components situated closely to each
other; and, by means of formula (68) in connection with
relation (1), it was actually found possible, within the limits of experimental errors, to account for the frequencies of
the components of this so called fine structure of the hydrogen lines. Moreover the theory was supported in the most
striking way by Paschen’s1
) recent investigation of the fine
structure of the lines of the analogous helium spectrum, the
frequencies of which are represented approximately by formula (35), if in the expression for K, given by (40), we put
N = 2. As it should be expected from (68), the components
of these lines were found to show frequency differences several times larger than those of the hydrogen lines, and from
his measurements Paschen concluded, that it was possible
on Sommerfeld’s theory to account completely for the frequencies of all the components observed.
We shall not enter here on the details of the calculation
leading to (68), but shall only show how this formula may be
simply interpreted from the point of view of perturbed periodic systems. Thus, by a simple application of relativistic
mechanics, it is found that, if the equation of a Keplerian el1

, in which expression p denotes the angular
momentum of the electron round the nucleus.1
) Now in the
stationary states the quantity in the bracket, which is of the
same order of magnitude as the ratio between the velocity
of the electron and the velocity of light, will be very small,
unless N is a large number, and it will therefore be seen that
the orbit of the electron can be described as a periodic orbit
on which a slow uniform rotation is superposed. Denoting
the frequency of revolution in the periodic orbit by ω and the
frequency of the superposed rotation by vR, we have, with
neglect of small quantities of higher order than the square of
the ratio between the velocity of the electron and the velocity
of light,
vR = ω(1 − γ) = 1

Comparing this formula with equation (62) and remembering
that, with the approximation in question, p may be replaced
by the quantity denoted in § 2 by α2, we see that the frequency of the secular rotation of the orbit will be the same
as that which would appear, if the variation of the mass of
the electron was neglected, but if the atom was subject to a
small external central force the mean value of the potential

This is simply shown, however, to be equal to the expression
for ψ corresponding to a small attractive force varying as
the inverse cube of the distance. In fact, let the potential of
such a force be given by Ω = C/r2
, where C is a constant
and r the length of the radius vector from the nucleus to the
electron. By means of the relation α2 = mr2ϑ˙

the angular distance of the radius vector from a fixed line in

If the relativity modifications are taken into account, and
if for a moment we would imagine that the nucleus, in addition to its usual attraction, exerted a small repulsion on
the electron, proportional to the inverse cube of the distance
and equal and opposite to the attraction just mentioned, we
would therefore obtain a system for which, with neglect of
small quantities of higher order than the square of the ratio between the velocity of the electron and the velocity of
light, every orbit would be periodic independent of the initial conditions, and for which consequently the stationary
states would be fixed by the single condition I = nh. Now
129
the actual hydrogen atom may obviously be considered as a
perturbed system, formed by this periodic system, when it is
exposed to a small central field for which the value of ψ is
given by (70). With the approximation mentioned, we get
therefore for the total energy in the stationary states of the

by introducing in (70) the value of α2 given by (64) and the
value of ωn given by (41), neglecting the small correction
due to the finite mass of the nucleus. Remembering that
in our notation n1 + n2 = n and n2 = n, it will be seen
that, as regards the small differences in the energy of the
different stationary states corresponding to the same value
of n, formula (71) gives the same result as Sommerfeld’s
formula (68). In fact, comparing (68) and (71), we get

which is seen to be a function of n only. This expression
might also have been deduced directly from the condition
I = nh by considering, for instance, a circular orbit, in which
case the calculation can be very simply performed.
In connection with the above calculations, it may be remembered that the fixation of the stationary states, leading
to the formulæ (68) or (71), is based on the assumption,
130
that the motion of the electron can be determined as that
of a mass point which moves in a conservative field of force,
according to the laws of ordinary relativistic mechanics, and
that we have looked apart from all such forces which, according to the ordinary theory of electrodynamics, would
act on an accellerated charged particle, and which constitute the reaction from the radiation which on this theory
would accompany the motion of the electron. Some procedure of this kind, which means a radical departure from the
ordinary theory of electrodynamics, is obviously necessary in
the quantum theory in order to avoid dissipation of energy
in the stationary states. Since we are entirely ignorant as
regards the mechanism of radiation, we must be prepared,
however, to find that the above treatment will allow to determine the motion in the stationary states, only with an
approximation which looks apart from small quantities of
the same order as the ratio between the radiation forces in
ordinary electrodynamics and the main forces on the electron due to the attraction from the nucleus.1
) Now it is

) Compare Part I, page 6. It may in this connection be noted that
the degree of approximation, involved in the determination of the frequencies of an atomic system by means of relation (1) if in the fixation
of the stationary states we look apart from small forces of the same order of magnitude as the radiation forces in ordinary electrodynamics,
would appear to be intimately connected with the limit of sharpness of
the spectral lines, which depends on the total number of waves contained
in the radiation emitted during the transition between two stationary
states. In fact, from a consideration based on the general connection
between the quantum theory and the ordinary theory of radiation, it
131
easily shown that this ratio will be a small quantity of the
same order of magnitude as N2


, and it would therefore beforehand seem justified in the expression for the total
energy in the stationary states to retain small terms of the
same order as the second term in (71), while at the same
time it might appear highly questionable, whether, in the
complete expression for the total energy in the stationary
states deduced by Sommerfeld and Debye on the basis of
the conditions (16), it has a physical meaning to retain terms
of higher order than those retained in formula (68); unless
N is a large number, as in the theory of the R¨ontgenspectra
to be discussed in Part III.
While the preceding considerations, which deal with the
determination of the energy in the stationary states of the
hydrogen atom, allow to determine the frequency of the radiation which would be emitted during a transition between
two such states, they leave quite untouched the problem of
the actual occurrence of these transitions in the luminous
gas, and therefore give no direct information about the numseems natural to assume that the rate, at which radiation is emitted
during a transition between two stationary states, is of the same order
of magnitude as the rate, at which radiation would be emitted from the
system in these states according to ordinary electrodynamics. But this
will be seen to imply that the total number of waves in question will
just be of the same order as the ratio between the main forces acting
on the particles of the system and the reaction from the radiation in
ordinary electrodynamics.

ber and relative intensities of the components into which the
hydrogen lines may be expected to split up as a consequence
of the relativity modifications. This problem has recently
been discussed by Sommerfeld,
1
) who in this connection
emphasises the importance of the different a-priori probabilities of the stationary states, characterised by different sets
of values of the n’s in the conditions (16). Thus Sommerfeld attempts to obtain a measure for the relative intensities
of the components of the fine structure of a given line, by
comparing the intensities observed with the products of the
values of the a-priori probabilities of the two states, involved
in the emission of the components under consideration; and
he tries in this connection to test different expressions for
these a-priori probabilities (See Part I, page 47). In this
way, however, it was not found possible to account in a satisfactory manner for the observations; and the difficulty in
obtaining an explanation of the intensities on this basis was
also strikingly brought out by the fact, that the number and
relative intensities of the components observed varied in a remarkable way with the experimental conditions under which
the lines were excited. Thus Paschen found a greater number of components in the fine structure of the helium lines,
mentioned above, when the gas was subject to a condensed
interrupted discharge, than when a continuous voltage was
applied. It would seem, however, that all the facts observed
obtain a simple interpretation on the basis of the general con1

133
siderations about the relation between the quantum theory
of line spectra and the ordinary theory of radiation discussed
in Part I. According to this relation, we shall assume that
the probability, for a transition between two given stationary states to take place, will depend not only on the a-priori
probability of these states, which is determining for their
occurrence in a distribution of statistical equilibrium, but
will also depend essentially on the motion of the particles
in these states, characterised by the harmonic vibrations in
which this motion can be resolved. Now, in the absence of
external forces, the motion of the electron in the hydrogen
atom forms a special simple case of the motion of a conditionally periodic system possessing an axis of symmetry,
and may therefore be represented by trigonometric series of
the type deduced for such motions in Part I. Taking a line
through the nucleus perpendicular to the plane of the orbit
as z-axis, we get from the calculations on page 59
z = const.

(73)
where ω1 is the frequency of the radial motion and ω2 is the
mean frequency of revolution, and where the summation is to
be extended over all positive and negative entire values of τ .
It will thus be seen that the motion may be considered as a
134
superposition of a number of circular harmonic vibrations,
for which the direction of rotation is the same as, or the opposite of, that of the revolution of the electron round the
nucleus, according as the expression τω1 + ω2 is positive or
negative respectively. From the relation just mentioned between the quantum theory of line spectra and the ordinary
theory of radiation, we shall therefore in the present case
expect that, if the atom is not disturbed by external forces,
only such transitions between stationary states will be possible, in which the plane of the orbit remains unaltered, and in
which the number n2 in the conditions (16) decreases or increases by one unit; i. e. where the angular momentum of the
electron round the nucleus decreases or increases by h/2π.
From the relation under consideration, we shall further expect that there will be an intimate connection between the
probability of a spontaneous transition of this type between
two stationary states, for which n1 is equal to n

depend on the value Cτ of the amplitude of the harmonic
rotation, corresponding to τ = ±(n

), which appears in
the motion of the electron. Without entering upon a closer
examination of the numerical values of these amplitudes, it
will directly be seen that the amplitudes of the harmonic
rotations, which have the same direction as the revolution
of the electron, in general, are considerably larger than the
amplitudes of the rotations in the opposite direction, and
135
we shall accordingly expect that the probability of spontaneous transition will in general be much larger for transitions, in which the angular momentum decreases, than for
transitions in which it increases. This expectation is verified by Paschen’s observations of the fine structure of the
helium lines, which show that, for a given line, the components corresponding to the transitions of the former kind are
by far the strongest. On Paschen’s photographs, however,
especially in the case of the application of a condensed discharge to the vacuum tube containing the gas, there appear,
in addition to the main components corresponding to transitions for which the angular momentum changes by h/2π,
a number of weaker components, corresponding to transitions for which the angular momentum remains unchanged
or changes by higher multipla of h/2π. This fact obtains
a simple interpretation on the considerations in Part I on
page 64 about the influence of small external forces on the
spectrum of a conditionally periodic system. Thus, in the
presence of small perturbing forces, the motion will generally
not remain in a plane, and in the trigonometric series representing the displacement of the electron in space, there will
occur small terms corresponding to frequencies (τ1ω1+τ2ω2),
where τ2 may be different from one. In the presence of such
forces, we shall therefore expect that, in addition to the regular probabilities of the above mentioned main transitions,
there will appear small probabilities for other transitions.1

A detailed discussion of these problems will be given in a
later paper by Mr. H. A. Kramers, who on my proposal
has kindly undertaken to examine the resolution of the motion of the electron in its constituent harmonic vibrations
more closely, and who has deduced explicit expressions for
the amplitudes of these vibrations, not only for the motion
of the electron in the undisturbed atom, but also for the
perturbed motion in the presence of a small external homogeneous electric field. As it will be shown by Kramers,
these calculations allow to account in particulars for the observations of the relative intensities of the components of the
fine structure of the hydrogen lines and the analogous helium
lines, as well as for the characteristic way in which this phenomenon is influenced by the variation of the experimental
conditions.
