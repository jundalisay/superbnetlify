Adventurers assert that their difficulty is not in production, but the sale of their commodities. products would always be abundant, if there were but a ready demand, or market for them. When the demand for their commodities is slow, difficult, and productive of little advantage, they pronounce money to be scarce; the grand object of their desire is, a consumption brisk enough to quicken sales and keep up prices.

But ask them what peculiar causes and circumstances facilitate the demand for their products, and you will soon per-
ceive that most of them have extremely vague notions of these matters; that their observation of facts is imperfect, and their explanation still more so; that they treat doubtful points as matter of certainty, often pray for what is directly opposite to
their interests, and importunately solicit from authority a protection of the most mischievous tendency.

To enable us to form clear and correct practical notions in regard to markets for the products of industry, we must carefully analyse the best established and most certain facts, and apply to them the Inferences we have already deduced from a similar way of proceed. ing; and thus perhaps we may arrive at new and important truths, that may serve to enlighten the views of the agents of industry, and to give confidence to the measures of governments anxious to afford them encouragement.

Thus, to say that sales are dull, owing to the scarcity of money,
is to mistake the means for the cause; an error that proceeds
from the circumstance, that almost all produce is in the first
instance exchanged for money, before it is ultimately converted into other produce= and the commodity, which recurs
so repeatedly in use, appears to vulgar apprehensions the most
important of commodities, and the end and object of all transactions, whereas it is only the medium. Sales cannot be said
to be dull because money is scarce, but because other products are so. There is always money enough to conduct the
circulation and mutual interchange of other values, when those
values really exist. Should the increase of traffic require more
money to facilitate it, the want is easily supplied, and is a
strong indication of prosperity a proof that a great abundance
of values has been created, which it is wished to exchange for
other values. In such cases, merchants know well enough how to find substitutes for the product serving as the medium of exchange or money= 130 and money itself soon pours in, for this reason, that all produce naturally gravitates to that place
where it is most in demand. It is a good sign when the business is too great for the money; just in the same way as it is a good sign when the goods are too plentiful for the warehouses.

When a superabundant article can find no vent, the scarcity of money has so little to do with the obstruction of its sale,
that the sellers would gladly receive its value in goods for their own consumption at the current price of the day= they
would not ask for money, or have any occasion for that product, since the only use thev could make of it would be to
convert it forthwith into articles of their own consumption. 131


A man who applies his labour to the investing of objects with value by the creation of utility of some sort, can not expect such a value to be appreciated and paid for, unless where other men have the means of purchasing it. Now, of what do these means consist? Of other values of other products, likewise the fruits of industry, capital, and land. Which leads us
to a conclusion that may at first sight appear paradoxical, namely, that it is production which opens a demand for products.

Should a tradesman say, “I do not want other products for my woollens, I want money,” there could be little difficulty in
convincing him that his customers could not pay him in money, without having first procured it by the sale of some other
commodities of their own. “Yonder farmer,” he may be told, “will buy your woollens, if his crops be good, and will buy
more or less according to their abundance or scantiness; he can buy none at all, if his crops fail altogether. 

Neither can you buy his wool nor his corn yourself, unless you contrive to get woollens or some other article to buy withal. You say, you only want money; I say, you want other commodities, and not money. 

For what, in point of fact, do you want the money? 

Is it not for the purchase of raw materials or stock for your trade, or victuals for your support? 129 

Wherefore, it is products that you want, and not money. The silver coin you will have received on the sale of your own products, and given in the purchase of those of other people, will the next moment execute the same office between other contracting parties, and so from one to another to infinity; just as a public vehicle successively transports objects one after another. 

If you can not find a ready sale for your commodity, will you say, it is merely for want of a vehicle to transport it? 

For, after all, money is but the agent of the transfer of values. 

Its whole utility has consisted in conveying to your hands the value of the commodities, which your customer has sold, for the purpose of buying again from you; and the very next purchase you make, it will again convey to a third person the value of the products you may have sold to others. 

So that you will have bought, and every body must buy, the objects of want or
desire, each with the value of his respective products transformed into money for the moment only. Otherwise, how could
it be possible that there should now be bought and sold in
France five or six times as many commodities, as in the miserable reign of Charles VI? Is it not obvious, that five or six
times as many commodities must have been produced, and that they must have served to purchase one or the other?”




At the same time that one commodity makes a loss, another commodity is making excessive profit. 133 And, since such profits must operate as a powerful stimulus to the cultivation of that particular
kind of products, there must needs be some violent means, or
some extraordinary cause, a political or natural convulsion,
or the avarice or ignorance of authority, to perpetuate this
scarcity on the one hand, and consequent glut on the other.

No sooner is the cause of this political disease removed, than the means of production feel a natural impulse towards the
vacant channels, the replenishment of which restores activity to all the others. One kind of production would seldom out-
strip every other, and its products be disproportionately cheapened, were production left entirely free. 134


This observation is applicable to all cases, where there is a supply of commodities or of services in the market. They will
universally find the most extensive demand in those places, where the most of values are produced; because in no other
places are the sole means of purchase created, that is, values. 

Money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will
always be found, that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.

A product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other prod-
ucts to the full extent of its own value. When the producer
has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious
to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his
hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may
get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the
only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some
product or other. Thus, the mere circumstance of the creation
of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.
Should a producer imagine, that many other classes, yielding
no material products, are his customers and consumers equally
with the classes that raise themselves a product of their own;
as, for example, public functionaries, physicians, lawyers,
churchmen, &c., and thence infer, that there is a class of de-
mand other than that of the actual producers, he would but
expose the shallowness and superficiality of his ideas. A priest
goes to a shop to buy a gown or a surplice; he takes the value,
that is to make the purchase, in the form of money. Whence
had he that money? From some tax-gatherer who has taken it
from a tax-payer. But whence did this latter derive it? From
the value he has himself produced. This value, first produced
by the tax-payer, and afterwards turned into money, and given
to the priest for his salary, has enabled him to make the pur-
chase. The priest stands in the place of the producer, who
might himself have laid the value of his product on his own
account, in the purchase, perhaps, not of a gown or surplice,
but of some other more serviceable product. The consump-
tion of the particular product, the gown or surplice, has but
supplanted that of some other product. It is quite impossible
that the purchase of one product can be affected, otherwise
than by the value of another. 135
For this reason, a good harvest is favourable, not only to the
agriculturist, but likewise to the dealers in all commodities
generally. The greater the crop, the larger are the purchases
of the growers. A bad harvest, on the contrary, hurts the sale
of commodities at large. And so it is also with the products of
manufacture and commerce. The success of one branch of
commerce supplies more ample means of purchase, and con-
sequently opens a market for the products of all the other
branches; on the other hand, the stagnation of one channel of
manufacture, or of commerce, is felt in all the rest.
But it may be asked, if this be so, how does it happen, that
there is at times so great a glut of commodities in the market,
and so much difficulty in finding a vent for them? Why can-
not one of these superabundant commodities be exchanged
for another? I answer that the glut of a particular commodity
arises from its having outrun the total demand for it in one or
two ways; either because it has been produced in excessive
abundance, or because the production of other commodities
has fallen short.

From this important truth may be deduced the following im-
portant conclusions= —
1. That, in every community the more numerous are the pro-
ducers, and the more various their productions, the more
prompt, numerous, and extensive are the markets for those
productions; and, by a natural consequence, the more profit-
able are they to the producers; for price rises with the de-
mand. But this advantage is to be derived from real produc-
tion alone, and not from a forced circulation of products; for
a value once created is not augmented in its passage from one
hand to another, nor by being seized and expended by the
government, instead of by an individual. The man, that lives
upon the productions of other people, originates no demand
for those productions; he merely puts himself in the place of
It is because the production of some commodities has de-
clined, that other commodities are superabundant. To use a
more hackneyed phrase, people have bought less, because
they have made less profit; 132 and they have made less profit
for one or two causes; either they have found difficulties in
the employment of their productive means, or these means
have themselves been deficient.

liberal principles. The brilliant results of this enlightened
policy will demonstrate, that the systems and theories really
destructive and fallacious, are the exclusive and jealous max-
ims acted upon by the old European governments, and by
them most impudently styled practical truths, for no other
reason, as it would seem, than because they have the misfor-
tune to put them in practice. The United States will have the
honour of proving experimentally, that true policy goes hand-
in-hand with moderation and humanity. 137
the producer, to the great injury of production, as we shall
presently see.
2. That each individual is interested in the general prosperity
of all, and that the success of one branch of industry pro-
motes that of all the others. In fact, whatever profession or
line of business a man may devote himself to, he is the better
paid and the more readily finds employment, in proportion as
he sees others thriving equally around him. A man of talent,
that scarcely vegetates in a retrograde state of society, would
find a thousand ways of turning his faculties to account in a
thriving community that could afford to employ and reward
his ability. A merchant established in a rich and populous
town, sells to a much larger amount than one who sets up in a
poor district, with a population sunk in indolence and apathy.
What could an active manufacturer, or an intelligent merchant,
do in a small deserted and semi-barbarous town in a remote
corner of Poland or Westphalia? Though in no fear of a com-
petitor, he could sell but little, because little was produced;
whilst at Paris, Amsterdam, or London, in spite of the com-
petition of a hundred dealers in his own line, he might do
business on the largest scale. The reason is obvious= he is
surrounded with people who produce largely in an infinity of
ways, and who make purchases, each with his respective prod-
ucts, that is to say, with the money arising from the sale of
what he may have produced.
3. From this fruitful principle, we may draw this further con-
clusion, that it is no injury to the internal or national industry
and production to buy and import commodities from abroad;
for nothingr can be bought from strangers, except with native
products, which find a vent in this external traffic. Should it
be objected, that this foreign produce may have been bought
with specie, I answer, specie s not always a native product,
but must have been bought itself with the products of native
industry; so that, whether the foreign articles be paid for in
specie or in home products, the vent for national industry is
the same in both cases. 138
4. The same principle leads to the conclusion, that the en-
couragement of mere consumption is no benefit to commerce;
for the difficulty lies in supplying the means, not in stimulat-
ing the desire of consumption; and we have seen that produc-
tion alone, furnishes those means. Thus, it is the aim of good
government to stimulate production, of bad government to
encourage consumption.
This is the true source of the gains made by the towns’ people
out of the country people, and again by the latter out of the
former; both of them have wherewith to ouy more largely, the
more amply they themselves produce. A city, standing in the
centre of a rich surrounding country, feels no want of rich
and numerous customers’ and, on the other hand, the vicinity
of an opulent city gives additional value to the produce of the
country. The division of nations into agricultural, manufac-
turing, and commercial, is idle enough. For the success of a
people in agriculture is a stimulus to its manufacturing and
commercial prosperity; and.the flourishing condition of its
manufacture and commerce reflects a benefit upon its agri-
culture also. 136
For the same reason that the creation of a new product is the
opening of a new market for other products, the consumption
or destruction of a product is the stoppage of a vent for them.
This is no evil where the end of the product has been an-
swered, by its destruction, which end is the satisfying of some
human want, or the creation of some new product designed
for such a satisfaction. Indeed, if the nation be in a thriving
condition, the gross national re-production exceeds the gross
consumption. The consumed products have fulfilled their
office, as it is natural and fitting they should; the consump-
tion, however, has opened no new market, but just the re-
verse. 139
The position of a nation, in respect of its neighbours, is analo-
gous to the relation of one of its provinces to the others, or of
the country to the town; it has an interest in their prosperity,
being sure to profit by their opulence. The government of the
United States, therefore, acted most wisely, in their attempt,
about the year 1802, to civilize their savage neighbours, the
Creek Indians. The design was to introduce habits of indus-
try amongst them, and make them producers capable of car-
rying on a barter trade with the States of the Union; for there
is nothing to be got by dealing with a people that have noth-
ing to pay. It is useful and honourable to mankind, that one
nation among so many should conduct itself uniformly upon
Having once arrived at the clear conviction, that the general
demand for products is brisk in proportion to the activity of
production, we need not trouble ourselves much to inquire
towards what chan nel of industry production may be most
advantageously directed. The products created give rise to
various degrees of demand, accord ing to the wants, the man-
ners, the comparative capital, industry, and natural resources
of each country; the article most in request, owing to the com-
petition of buyers, yields the best interest of money to the
capitalist, the largest profits to the adventurer, and the best

wages to the labourer; and the agency of their respective ser-
vices is naturally attracted by these advantages towards those
particular channels.
A Lisbon trader imports the cotton from Brazil. It is his inter-
est that his factors in America be expeditious in making pur-
chases and remitting cargoes, and likewise, that he meet no
delay in selling his cotton to a French merchant; because he
thereby gets his returns the sooner, and can sooner recom-
mence a new and equally lucrative operation. So far, it is
Portugal that benefits by the increased activity of circulation;
the subsequent advantage is on the side of France. If the French
merchant keep the Brazil cotton but a short time in his ware-
house, before he sells it to the cotton-spinner, if the spinner
after spinning sell it immediately to the weaver, if the weaver
dispose of it forthwith to the calico printer, and he in his turn
sell it without much delay to the retail dealer, from whom it
quickly passes to the consumer, this rapid circulation will have
occupied for a shorter period the capital embarked by these
respective producers; less interest of capital will have been
incurred; consequently the prime cost of the article will be
lower, and the capital will have been the sooner disengaged
and applicable to fresh operations.
In a community, city, province, or nation, that produces abun-
dantly, and adds every moment to the sum of its products,
almost all the branches of commerce, manufacture, and gen-
erally of industry, yield handsome profits, because the de-
mand is great, and because there is always a large quantity of
products in the market, ready to bid for new productive ser-
vices. And, vice versa, wherever, by reason of the blunders
of the nation or its government, production is stationary, or
does not keep pace with consumption, the demand gradually
declines, the value of the product is less than the charges of
its production; no productive exertion is properly rewarded;
profits and wages decrease; the employment of capital be-
comes less advantageous and more hazardous; it is consumed
piecemeal, not through extravagance, but through necessity,
and because the sources of profit are dried up. 140 The labouring
classes experience a want of work; families before in toler-
able circumstances, are more cramped and confined; and those
before in difficulties are left altogether destitute. Depopula-
tion, misery, and returning barbarism, occupy the place of
abundance and happiness. Such are the concomitants of declining production, which are only to be remedied by frugality, intelligence, activity, and freedom.

All these different purchases and sales, with many others that, for brevity’s sake, I have not noticed, were indispensable before the Brazil cotton could be worn in the shape of printed calicoes. They are so many productive fashions given to this
product; and the more rapidly they may have been given, the more benefit will have been derived fromn the production.
But, if the same commodity be merely sold several times over
in a year in the same place, without undergoing any fresh
modification, this circulation would be a loss instead of a
gain, and would increase instead of reducing the prime cost
to the consumer. A capital must be employed in buying and
re-selling, and interest paid for its use, to say nothing of the
probable wear and tear of the commodity.
