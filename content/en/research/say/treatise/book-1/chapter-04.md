Industry receives aid from capital as the products of her own previous creation. These products create other products which aid industry through the agency of a variety of agents not of her own creation, but offered spontaneously by nature.

From the co-operation of these natural agents derives a portion of the utility she communicates to things.

What is true of one, two, three, or four individuals, is true of society in the aggregate. The capital of a nation is made up of
the sum total of private capitals; and, in proportion as a nation is prosperous and industrious, in the same proportion is
that part of its capital, vested in the shape of money, trifling
compared to the amount of the gross national capital. 

Neckar estimates the circulating medium in France, in the year 1784, at about 440 million dollars. His estimate is exaggerated. 

However, if account be taken of all the works, enclosures, live stock, utensils, machines, ships, commodi-
ties, and provisions of all sorts belonging to the French people
or their government in any part of the world; and, if to these
be added the furniture, decorations, jewellery, plate, and other
items of luxury or convenience, whereof they were possessed,
at the same period, it will be found that 440 millions of circulating medium was a mere trifle compared to the aggregate of
these united values. 56

Thus, when a field is ploughed and sown, besides the science
and the labour employed in this operation, besides the pre-
created values brought into use, the values, for instance, of
the plough, the harrow, the seed-corn, the food and clothing
consumed by labourers during the process of production, there
is a process performed by the soil, the air, the rain, and the
sun, wherein mankind bears no part, but which nevertheless
concurs in the creation of the new product that will be ac-
quired at the season of harvest. This process I call the pro-
ductive agency of natural agents.
The term natural agents is here employed in a very extensive
sense; comprising not merely inanimate bodies, whose agency
operates to the creation of value, but likewise the laws.of the
physical world, as gravitation, which makes the weight of a
clock descend; magnetism, which points the needle of the
compass= the elasticity of steel; the gravity of the atmosphere;
the property of heat to discharge itself by ignition, &c. &c.
Beeke estimates the total capital of Great Britain at 2300
millions sterling, 57 (equal to more than 11,000 millions of
dollars.) The total amount of her circulating specie, before

the power of the natural agents that industry and civilization
set at work for our advantage.
The productive faculty of capital is often so interwoven with
that of natural agents, that it is difficult, or perhaps impos-
sible, to assign, with accuracy, their respective shares in the
business of production. A hot-house for the raising of exotic
plants, a meadow fertilized by judicious irrigation, owe the
greater part of their productive powers to works and erec-
tions, the effect of antecedent production, which form a part
of the capital devoted to the furtherance of actual and present
production. The same may be said of land newly cleared and
brought into cultivation; of farm-buildings; of enclosures; and
of all other permanent ameliorations of a landed estate. These
values are items of capital, though it be no longer possible to
sever them from the soil they are attached to. 60
Smith admits that human intelligence, and the knowledge of
the laws of nature, enable mankind to turn the resources she
offers to better account= but he goes on to attribute to the
division of labour this very degree of intelligence and knowl-
edge= and he is right to a certain degree; for a man, by the
exclusive pursuit of a single art or science, has ampler means
of accelerating its progress towards perfection. But, when once
the system of nature is discovered, the production resulting
from the discovery, is no longer the product of the inventor’s
industry. The man who first discovered the property of fire to
soften metals, was not the actual creator of the utility this
process adds to smelted ore. That utility results from the physi-
cal action of fire, in concurrence, it is true, with the labour
and capital of those who employ the process. But are there no
processes that mankind owes the knowledge of to pure acci-
dent? or that are so self-evident, as to have required no skill
to discover? When a tree, a natural product, is felled, is soci-
ety put into possession of no greater produce than that of the
mere labour of the woodman?
In the employment of machinery, which wonderfully augments
the productive power of man, the product obtained is due
partly to the value of the capital vested in the machine, and
partly to the agency of natural powers. Suppose a tread-mill, 61
worked by ten men, to be used in place of a wind-mill, the
product of the mill might be considered as the fruit of the
productive agency of a capital consisting of the value of the
machine, and of the labour of ten men employed in turning
the wheel. If the tread-mill be supplanted by sails, it is evi-
dent that the wind, a natural agent, does the work of ten hu-
man beings.
From this error Smith has drawn the false conclusion, that all
values produced represent pre-exerted human labour or in-
dustry, either recent or remote; or, in other words, that wealth
is nothing more than labour accumulated; from which posi-
tion he infers a second consequence equally erroneous, viz.
that labour is the sole measure of wealth, or of value pro-
duced.
In this instance, the absence of the natural agent might be
remedied, by the employment of another power; but there are
many cases, in which the agency of nature could not possibly
be dispensed with, and is yet equally positive and real; for
example, the vegetative power of the soil, the vital principle
which concurs in the production of the animals domesticated
to our use. A flock of sheep is the joint result of the owner’s
and shepherd’s care, and the capital advanced in fodder, shel-
ter, and shearing, and of the action of the organs and viscera
with which nature has furnished these animals.
This system is obviously in direct opposition to that of the
economists of the eighteenth century, who, on the contrary,
maintained that labour produces no value without consuming
an equivalent; that, consequently, it leaves no surplus, no net
produce; and that nothing but the earth produces gratuitous
value,—therefore nothing else can yield net produce. Each
of these positions has been reduced to system; I only cite
them to warn the student of the dangerous consequences of
an error in the outset, 63 and to bring the science back to the
simple observation of facts. Now facts demonstrate, that val-
ues produced are referable to the agency and concurrence of
industry, of capital, 64 and of natural agents, whereof the chief,
though by no means the only one, is land capable of cultiva-
tion; and that no other but these three sources can produce
value, or add to human wealth.
Thus nature is commonly the fellow-labourer of man and his
instruments; a fellowship advantageous to him in proportion
as he succeeds in dispensing with. his own personal agency,
and that of his capital, and in throwing upon nature a larger
part of the burthen of production.
Smith has taken infinite pains to explain, how it happens that
civilized communities enjoy so great an abundance of prod-
ucts, in comparison with nations less polished, and in spite of
the swarm of idlers and unproductive labourers that is to be
met with in society. He has traced the source of that abun-
dance to the division of labour; 62 and it cannot be doubted,
that the productive power of industry is wonderfully enhanced
by that division, as we shall hereafter see by following his
steps; but this circumstance alone is not sufficient to explain
a phenomenon, that will no longer surprise, if we consider
Of natural agents, some are susceptible of appropriation, that
is to say of becoming the property of an occupant, as a field,
a current of water; others can not be appropriated, but remain
liable to public use, as the wind, the sea, free navigable
streams, the physical or chemical action of bodies one upon another, &c. &c.

The ownership of land, capital, and industry is sometimes
united in the same hands. A man who cultivates his own garden at his own expense, is at once the possessor of land, capi-
tal, and industry, and exclusively enjoys the profits of propri-
etor, capitalist, and labourer.

We shall by-and-by have an opportunity of convincing our-
selves, that this alternative, of productive agents being or not
being susceptible of appropriation, is highly favourable to
the progress of wealth. Natural agents, like land, which are
susceptible of appropriation, would not produce nearly so
much, were not the proprietors certain of exclusively gather-
ing their produce, and able to vest in them, with full confi-
dence, the capital which so much enlarges their productive-
ness. On the other hand, the indefinite latitude allowed to
industry to occupy at will the unappropriated natural agents,
opens a boundless prospect to the extension of her agency
and production. It is not nature, but ignorance and bad gov-
ernment, that limit the productive powers of industry.
The knife-grinder’s craft requires no occupancy of land; he
carries his stock in trade upon his shoulders, and his skill and
industry at his fingers’ ends; being at the same time adven-
turer, 65 capitalist and labourer.
It is seldom that we meet with adventurers in industry so poor
as not to own at least a share of the capital embarked in their
concern. Even the common labourer generally advances some
portion; the bricklayer comes with his trowel in his hand; the
journeyman tailor is provided with his thimble and needles;
all are clothed better or worse; and though it be true, that
their clothing must be found out of their wages, still they find
it themselves in advance.
Such of the natural agents as are susceptible of appropria-
tion. form an item of productive means; for they do not yield
their concurrence without equivalent; which equivalent, as
we shall see in the proper place, forms an item of the rev-
enues of the appropriators. At present we must be content to
investigate the productive operation of natural agents of ev-
ery description, whether already known, or hereafter to be
discovered.
Where the land is not exclusive property, as is the case with
some stone-quarries, with public rivers and seas to which in-
dustry resorts for fish, pearls, coral, &c., products may be
obtained by industry and capital only.
