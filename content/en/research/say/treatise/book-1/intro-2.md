In every part of Europe, personal freedom became more generally respected due to the influence of public sentiment.
<!-- if not from a more improved organization of political society,
at least from the   --> Enlightened individuals has caused the following prejudices to decline:
- calling all loans with interest as usury
- making idleness a quality of <!-- and attaching the importance of --> nobility

<!--  have not only remarked the influence of these,
but of many other analogous facts; it has been perceived by
them, that  -->

They perceived the decline of such prejudices to be favourable to the advancement of science, or to a more exact knowledge of the immutable laws of nature. This then <!-- ; that this improvement in the
cultivation of science has itself --> has been favourable to the progress of industry, and industry to national opulence. 

<!-- From such an induction of facts they have been enabled to conclude, with
much greater certainty than the unthinking multitude, that  -->

Many modern states became wealthy through taxation and restrictions. But the enlightened people showed how those states became wealthy despite such restraints. <!--  on the natural course of human affairs, but in spite of such powerful causes of discouragement. --> Their prosperity would have been <!--  of the same countries would have --> been much greater had they been governed by a more liberal and enlightened policy. 6

<!-- posing them well examined, well observed, and well described, how many of them either prove nothing, or directly
the reverse of what’s intended to be established by them. -->

<!-- Hence, there is not an absurd theory, or an extravagant opinion that has not been supported by an appeal to facts; 4 and it
is by facts also that public authorities have been so often misled. But a knowledge of facts, without a knowledge of their
mutual relations, without being able to show why the one is a cause, and the other a consequence, is really no better than
the crude information of an office-clerk, of whom the most intelligent seldom becomes acquainted with more than one
particular series, which only enables him to examine a question in a single point of view.

Nothing can be more idle than the opposition of theory to practice! What is theory, if it be not a knowledge of the laws
which connect effects with their causes, or facts with facts?

And who can be better acquainted with facts than the theorist who surveys them under all their aspects, and comprehends their relation to each other? And what is practice 5 without theory, but the employment of means without knowing how or why they act? In any investigation, to treat dissimilar cases as if they were analogous, is but a dangerous kind of empiricism, leading to conclusions never foreseen. -->

<!-- Hence it is, that after having seen the exclusive or restrictive system of commerce, a system founded on ,   -->

After the revival of arts and letters, the mercantile system was almost universally adopted throughout Europe. It was based on the opinion that one nation can only gain what another loses. 

This system led to a perpetual increase in taxes. In some countries, it rose to an enormous amount. People saw that it made these same countries more opulent, populous, and powerful than they were when trade was free and had low taxes. And so people <!--  were almost entirely exempt from public burdens, the generality of mankind have --> concluded that national wealth and power were attributable to such:
- restraints imposed on industry
- taxes on incomes of individuals

<!-- Shallow thinkers have even pretended that this opinion was founded on facts, and that every different one was the offspring of a wild and disordered imagination. -->

To say whether this is true, <!--  obtain the truth we do not need so many facts. --> we only need the essential facts which have a direct and immediate influence. Above all, we need to:
- examine them under all their aspects
- deduce from them just conclusions
- be assured that the consequences ascribed to them do not in reality proceed from other causes. 

Every other fact is like the erudition of an almanac -- a mere useless compilation. 

<!-- And it may be remarked, that this sort of information is peculiar to men of clear memories and clouded judgments; men who declaim against the best established
doctrines, the fruits of the most enlarged experience and profoundest reasoning; and whilst inveighing against system,
whenever their own routine is departed from, are precisely those most under its influence, and who defend it with stub -->

The supporters of the opposite opinion embraced a wider circle of facts. <!-- , and understood them much better than their opponents. --> During the middle ages, free Italy and the Hanse towns of the north of Europe promoted industry and produced riches in both. They knew that the true causes of their increased opulence were:
- the shock of the crusades
- the progress of the arts and sciences
- the improvement of navigation and consequent discovery of the route to India and America

<!-- , as well as a succession of other less important events, were all known to them as the true causes of  of the most ingenious nations on the globe. -->

These led to the decline of the power of <!-- And although they were aware that this activity had received successive checks, they at the same time knew that it had been freed from more oppressive obstacles.

by both parties, but are classed and explained differently by
each; and it is worthy of remark, that  -->

In these contests, genuine philosophers are not arrayed against pretenders. Leibnitz and Newton, Linnuaus and Jussieu, Priestley and Lavoisier, Desaussure and Dolomieu, were all men of uncommon genius, who, however, did not agree in their philosophical systems. But have not the sciences they taught an existence, notwithstanding these disagreements? 7

Thus, if from all the phenomena of production, as well as from the experience of the most extensive commerce, you demonstrate that a free intercourse between nations is reciprocally advantageous, and that the mode found to be most beneficial to individuals transacting business with foreigners, must be equally so to nations, men of contracted views and high presumption will accuse you of system. Ask them for their reasons, and they will immediately talk to you of the balance of trade; will tell you, it is clear that a nation must be ruined by exchanging its money for merchandise — in itself a system. 

Some will assert that circulation enriches a state, and that a sum of money, by passing through 20 different hands, is equivalent to twenty times its own value; others, that luxury is favourable to industry, and economy ruinous to every branch of commerce — both mere systems; and all will appeal to facts in support of these opinions, like the shepherd, who upon the faith of his eyes, affirmed that the sun, which he saw rise in the morning and set in the evening, during the day traversed the whole extent of the heavens, treating as an idle dream the laws of the planetary world. 

In like manner, the general facts constituting the sciences of politics and morals, exist independently of all controversy.

Hence the advantage enjoyed by every one who, from distinct and accurate observation, can establish the existence of these general facts, demonstrate their connexion, and deduce their consequences. They as certainly proceed from the nature of things as the laws of the material world. We do not imagine them; they are results disclosed to us by judicious observation and analysis. Sovereigns, as well as their subjects, must bow to their authority, and never can violate them with impunity. 

General facts form the general laws which facts follow. These laws are principles whenever they are applied. 

They become principles when we use them to ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us. 

A knowledge of principles is the only way of uniformly conducting any inquiry with success.

Persons who come from other branches of knowledge are ignorant of the principles of the political economy. 

They tend to suppose that absolute truth is confined to:
- mathematics and
- the results of careful observation and experiment in the physical sciences


They imagine that the moral and political sciences:
- contain no invariable facts or indisputable truths
- are not genuine sciences, but merely hypothetical systems that are purely arbitrary. 

This is because of:
- the lack of agreement among political writers
- the wild absurdities taught by some of them. 

<!-- But what science has been free from extravagant hypotheses? How many years have elapsed since those most advanced have been altogether disengaged from system? On the contrary, do we not still see men of perverted understandings attacking the best established positions?  -->
