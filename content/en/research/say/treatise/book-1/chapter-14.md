A whole country may grow rich even on its ornamental possessions. 

Were trees planted wherever they could thrive without injury to other products, 118 besides the accession of beauty and salubrity, and the additional moisture attracted by the multiplication of timber-trees, the value of the timber alone would, in a country of much extent, amount to something considerable. 

It is the province of speculative philosophy to trace the origin of the right of property; of legislation to regulate its transfer; and of political science to devise the surest means of protecting that right. Political economy recognises the right of property solely as the most powerful of all encouragements to the multiplication of wealth, and is satisfied with its actual stability, without inquiring about its origin or its safeguards. 

In fact, the legal inviolability of property is obviously a mere mockery, where the sovereign power is unable to make the laws respected, where it either practises robbery itself, 121 or is impotent to repress it in others; or where possession is rendered perpetually insecure, by the intricacy of legislative enactments, and the subtleties of
technical nicety. Nor can property be said to exist, where it is
not matter of reality as well as of right. 

Then, and then only, can the sources of production, namely, land, capital, and industry,
attain their utmost degree of fecundity. 122

There is this advantage, in the cultivation of timber-trees, that they require no human industry beyond the first planting, after which nature is the sole agent of their production. But it is not enough merely to plant, we must check the desire of cutting down, until the weak and slender stalk, gradually imbibing the juices of the earth and atmosphere, shall, without the
hand of cultivation, have acquired bulk and solidity, and spread its lofty foliage to the heavens. 119 The best that man can do for it is, to forget it for some years; and even where it yields no annual product, it will recompense his forbearance when arrived at maturity, by an ample supply of firing, and of timber for the carpenter, the joiner, and the wheel-wright.

There are some truths so completely self-evident, that demonstration is quite superfluous. This is one of that number. For
who will attempt to deny, that the certainty of enjoying the fruits of one’s land, capital and labour, is the most powerful inducement to render them productive? Or who is dull enough to doubt,
that no one knows so well as the proprietor how to make the best use of his property? Yet how often in practice is that inviolability of property disregarded, which, in theory, is allowed by
all to be so immensely advantageous? How often is it broken in
upon for the most insignificant purposes; and its violation, that
should naturally excite indignation, justified upon the most flimsy
pretexts? 

So few persons are there who have a lively sense of any but a direct injury, or, with the most lively feelings, have
firmness enough to act up to their sentiments! There is no security of property, where a despotic authority can possess itself of the property of the subject against his consent. 

Neither is there such security, where the consent is merely nominal and delusive. In England, the taxes are imposed by the national representation; if, then, the minister be in the possession of an absolute majority, whether by means of electioneering influence, or by the overwhelming patronage foolishly placed at his disposal, taxation would no longer be in reality imposed by the national representatives; the body bearing that name would, in effect, be the representatives of the minister; and the people of England would be forcibly subjected to the severest privations, to further projects that possibly might be every way injurious to them. 123

In all ages, the love of trees and their cultivation has been strongly recommended by the best writers. The historian of
Cyrus records, among his chief titles to renown, the merit of having planted all Asia Minor. In the United States, upon the
birth of a daughter, the cultivator plants a little wood, to grow up with her, and to be hex portion on the day of marriage. 120

Sully, whose views of policy were extremely enlightened, enriched most of the provinces of France with the plantation
he directed. I have seen several, to which public gratitude still affixes his name; and they remind me of the saying of
Addison, who was wont to exclaim, whenever he saw a plantation, “A useful man has passed this way.”

As yet we have been taken up with the consideration of the agents essential to production; without whose agency mankind would have no other subsistence or enjoyment, than the  scanty and limited supply that nature affords spontaneously.

We first investigated the mode in which these agents, each in its respective department, and all in concert, co-operate in
the work of production, and have afterwards examined in detail the individual action of each, for the further elucidation of the subject. We must now proceed to examine the intrinsic and accidental causes, which act upon production,
and clog or facilitate the exertion of productive agents. 

It is to be observed that the right of property is equally invaded, by obstructing the free employment of the means of production, as by violently depriving the proprietor of the product of his land, capital, or industry= for the right of property, as defined by jurists, is the right of use or even abuse. Thus, landed property is violated by arbitrarily prescribing tillage or planta-

the loss of superior depth and quality. 128 Sometimes a vein of mineral passes through the ground of many proprietors, but is
accessible only in one spot. In this case, the obstinacy of a refractory proprietor must be disregarded, and the prosecution of the works be compulsory; though, after all, I will not undertake to affirm, that it would not be more advisable on the whole to respect his rights, or that the possession of a few additional mines is not too dearly purchased by this infringement upon the inviolability of property.

tion; or by interdicting particular modes of cultivation; the property of the capitalist is violated, by prohibiting particular ways of employing it; for instance, by interdicting large purchases of corn, directing all bullion to be carried to the mint, forbidding the proprietor to build on his own soil, or prescribing the form and requisites of the building. It is a further violation of the capitalist’s property to prohibit any kind of industry, or to load
it with duties amounting to prohibition, after he has once embarked his capital in that way. It is manifest, that a prohibition upon sugar would annihilate most of the capital of the sugar refiners, vested in furnaces, utensils, &c. &c. 124

Lastly, public safety sometimes imperiously requires the sacrifice of private property; but that sacrifice is a violation, notwithstanding an indemnity given in such cases. For the right of property implies the free disposition of one’s own; and its sacrifice, however fully indemnified, is a forced disposition.

The property a man has in his own industry, is violated, whenever one is forbidden the free exercise of his faculties and talents, except insomuch as they would interfere with the rights of third parties. A similar violation is committed when a man’s labour is put in requisition for one purpose, though designed by himself for another; as when an artisan or trader is forced into the military life, whether permanently or merely for the occasion.

When public authority is not itself a spoliator, it procures to the nation the greatest of all blessings, protection from spoliation by others. 

Without this protection of each individual by the united force of the whole community, it is impossible to conceive any
considerable development of the productive powers of man, of land, and of capital; or even to conceive the existence of capital at all; for it is nothing more than accumulated value, operating under the safeguard of authority. This is the reason why no nation has ever arrived at any degree of opulence, that has not been subject to a regular government. Civilized nations are indebted to political organization for the innumerable and infinitely various productions, that satisfy their infinite wants, as well as for the fine arts and the opportunities of leisure that accumulation affords, without which the faculties of the mind tould never be cultivated, or man by their means attain the fill
dignity, whereof his nature is susceptible.

The security of property depends on the order of society. 

<!-- , takes precedence
of property itself; for which very reason, nothing short of the
necessity of defending that order from manifest danger can
authorise these or similar violations of individual right. --> And this it is which impresses upon the proprietors the necessity of requiring, in the constitution of the body politic, some guarantee or other, that the public service shall never be made a mask to the passions and ambition of those in power.

Thus taxation, when not intended as an engine of national depression and misery, must be proved indispensable to the exist-
ence of social order; every step it takes beyond these limits, is an actual spoliation; for taxation, even where levied by national consent, is a violation of property; since no values can be levied, but upon the produce of the land, capital, and industry of individuals.

The poor man, that can call nothing his own, is equally interested with the rich in upholding the inviolability of property.
His personal services would not be available, without the aid of accumulations previously made and protected. Every obstruc-
tion to, or dissipation of these accumulations, is a material injury to his means of gaining a livelihood; and the ruin and spoliation of the higher is as certainly followed by the misery and
degradation of the lower classes. 

A confused notion of the advantages of this right of property has been equally conducive with the personal interest of the wealthy, to make all civilized communities pursue and punish every invasion of property as a crime. 

The study of political economy is admirably calculated to justify and confirm this act of legislation; inasmuch, as it
explains why the happy effects, resulting from the right of property, are more striking in proportion as that right is well
guarded by political institutions.

But there are some extremely rare cases, where interference between the owner and his property is even beneficial to pro-
duction itself. 125 

For example, in all countries that admit the detestable right of slavery, a right standing in hostility to all
others, it is found expedient to limit the master’s power over his slave. 126 

Thus also, if a society stand in urgent need of timber for the shipwright or carpenter, it must reconcile itself to some
regulations respecting the felling of private woods; 127 or the fear of losing the veins of mineral that intersect the soil, may sometimes oblige a government to work the mines itself. 

It may be readily conceived, that, even if there were no restraints upon mining, want of skill, the impatience of avarice, or the insufficiency of capital, might induce a proprietor to exhaust the superficial, which are commonly the poorest loads, and occasion
