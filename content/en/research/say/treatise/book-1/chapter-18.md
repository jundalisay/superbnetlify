The substance of the argument of the prohibitionists is that domestic agriculture must be encouraged, even at the consumer's expense, in order to avoid the risk of starvation by external means. 

They say this is proven by 2 occasions: 

<!-- which is seriously to be apprehended on two, occasions in particular;  -->

1. When the enemy is able to intercept or check the imports
2. When the food-growing countries themselves experience a scarcity, and must retain their crops for their own subsistence. 204

New value cannot be produced, wealth cannot be increased, if the output of production is less than its cost of production. 207 

<!-- Thus, whether government or individuals be the adventurers in the losing concern, it is equally ruinous to the nation, and there is so much less value in the country.  -->

It is of no avail to pretend, that, although the government be a loser, its agents, the industrious people, or the workmen it employs, have made a profit. 

If the concern cannot support itself and pay its own way, the receipt must fall short of the outlay, and the difference fall upon those, who supply the expenditure of the state;

that is to say, the tax-payers. 208

The partisans of free-trade replied that if England became a constant grain importer then:
- many foreign countries would supply her
- wheat-farming in Poland, Spain, Barbary, and North America for Britain would grow. 
  - Their sale of wheat would become indispensable to them, as the purchase would be to England. 

Napopleon Bonaparte is the most bitter enemy of England. 
- He had taken Britain's money to export corn to her. 

The manufacture of Gobelin tapestry, carried on by the government of France, consumes a large quantity of wool, silk, and dyeing-drugs; 

furthermore, it consumes the rent of the
ground and buildings, as well as the wages of workmen employed; all which should be reimbursed by the product, which
they are very far from being. This establishment, instead of a
source of wealth to the nation at large, for the government is


But, although the public can scarcely be itself a successful
producer; it can at any rate give a powerful stimulus to indi-
vidual productive energy, by well-planned, well-conducted,
and well-supported public works, particularly roads, canals,
and harbours.

fully aware of the loss to itself, is, on the contrary, a source of
perpetual impoverishment. The annual loss to the nation is
the whole excess of the annual consumption of the concern,
including wages, which are one item of consumption, above
the annual product. The same may be said of the manufacture
of porcelain at Sevres, and I fear of all manufacturing con-
cerns carried on upon account of governments.

Facility of communication assists production, exactly in the same way as the machinery, that multiplies manufactured products, and abridges the labour of production. It is a means of furnishing the same product at less expense, which has exactly the same effect, as raising a greater product with the same expense. 

If we take into account the immense quantity of goods conveyed upon the roads of a rich and populous empire, from the commonest vegetables brought daily to market, up to the rarest imported luxuries poured into its harbours from every part of the globe, and thence diffused, by means of land-carriage, over the whole face of the territory, we shall readily perceive the inestimable economy of good roads in the charges of production. 

The saving in carriage amounts to the whole value the article has derived gratuitously from nature, if, without good roads, it could not be had at all. Were it possible to transplant from the mountain to the plain the beautiful forests that flourish and rot neglected upon the inaccessible sides of the Alps and Pyrenees, the value of these forests would be an entirely new creation of value to mankind, a clear gain of revenue both to the landholder and the consumer also.

We are told that:
- this is a necessary sacrifice
- otherwise the sovereign would be unprovided with objects of royal bounty and of royal splendour. This is no place to inquire how far the munificence of the monarch and the splendour of
his palaces contribute to the good government of the people.

I take for granted that these things are necessary; yet, admitting them to be so, there is no reason why the national sacrifices, requisite to support this magnificence and liberality, should be aggravated by the losses incurred by a misdirection of the public means. A nation had much better buy outright what it thinks proper to bestow; it would probably obtain for less money an object full as precious; for individuals
can always undersell the government. 209

There is a further evil attending the productive efforts of the government; they counteract the individual industry, not of those it deals with, for they take good care to be no losers, but of its competitors in production. 

The state is too formidable a rival in agriculture, manufacture, and commerce; it has too much wealth and power at command, and too little care of its own interest. It can submit to the loss of selling below prime cost; it can consume, produce, or monopolize in very little time so large a quantity of products, as violently to derange the relative prices of commodities= and every violent fluctuation of price is calamitous. 

The producer calculates upon the probable value of his product when ready for market; nothing discourages him so much, as a fluctuation that defies all calculation. The loss he suffers is equally unmerited, as the accidental gains that may be thrown into his hands. 

His unmerited gains, if any there be, are so much extra charge upon the consumer. There are some concerns, I know, which
the government must of necessity keep in its own hands. The building of ships of war cannot safely be left to individuals;
nor, perhaps, the manufacture of gunpowder. 

However, in France, cannon, muskets, caissons, and tumbrils are bought of private makers, and seemingly with benefit. Perhaps the same system might be further extended. A government must act by deputy, by the intermediate agency of a set of people, whose interest is in direct opposition to its own; and they will of course attend to their own in preference. If it be so circumstanced as to be invariably cheated in its bargains, there is no need to multiply the opportunities of fraud, by engaging itself in production and adventure; that is to say, embarking in concerns, that must infinitely multiply the occasions of bargaining with individuals.

Academies, libraries, public schools, and museums, founded by enlightened governments, contribute to the creation of
wealth, by the further discovery of truth, and the diffusion of what was known before; thus empowering the superior agents
and directors of production, to extend the application of human science to the supply of human wants. 210 So likewise of
travels, or voyages of discovery, undertaken at the public charge; the consequences of which have of late years been
rendered particularly brilliant, by the extraordinary merit of those who have devoted themselves to such pursuits.
It is observable, too, that the sacrifices made for the enlargement of human knowledge, or merely for its conservation,
should not be reprobated, though directed to objects of no immediate or apparent utility. 

The sciences have an universal chain of connexion. One which seems purely speculative must advance a step, before another of great and obvious practical utility can be promoted. Besides, it is impossible to say what useful properties may lie dormant in an object of mere curiosity. 

When the Dutchman, Otto Guericke, struck out tile first sparks of electricity, who would have supposed they would
have enabled Franklin to direct the lightning, and divert it from our edifices; an exploit apparently so far beyond the
powers of man?

colonies shake off their dependence upon the mother coun-
try, they become substantive and independent states.
But of all the means, by which a government can stimulate
production, there is none so powerful as the perfect security
of person and property, especially from the aggressions of
arbitrary power. 211 This security is of itself a source of public
prosperity, that more than counteracts all the restrictions hith-
erto invented for checking its progress. 

Restrictions compress the elasticity of production; but want of security destroys it
altogether. 212 To convince ourselves of this fact, it is suffi-
cient to compare the nations of western Europe with those
subject to the Ottoman power. Look at most parts of Africa,
Arabia, Persia, and Asia Minor, once so thickly strown with
flourishing cities, whereof, as Montesquieu remarks, no trace
now remains but in the pages of Strabo. 

The inhabitants are pillaged alike by bandits and pachas; wealth and population
have vanished; and the thinly scattered remnant are miserable objects of want and wretchedness. Survey Europe on the
other hand; and, though she is still far short of the prosperity
she might attain, most of her kingdoms are in a thriving condition, in spite of taxes and restrictions innumerable; for the
simple reason, that persons and property are there pretty generally safe from violence and arbitrary exaction.

It is common for nations to colonize when:
- their population becomes crowded in its ancient territorial limits
  - this is ancient colonization
- particular classes of society are exposed to the persecution of the rest. 
  - this is modern colonization

These appear to have been the only motives for colonization among the ancients; the moderns have been actuated
by other views. The vast improvements in navigation have opened new channels to their enterprise, and discovered countries before unknown; they have found their way to another hemisphere, and to the most inhospitable climates, not with
the intention of there fixing themselves and their posterity,
but to obtain valuable articles of commerce, and return to
their native countries, enriched with the fruits of a forced, but
yet very extensive production.

<!-- It is worth while to note this difference of motive, which has
made so marked a difference in the consequences of the two
systems of colonization. I am strongly tempted to call one the
colonial system of the ancients, and the other the colonial
system of the moderns;  -->

although there have been many colonies in modern times established on the ancient plan, of which
those of North America are the most distinguished. 213
There is one expedient by which a government may give its subjects a momentary accession of wealth, that I have hitherto omitted to mention. I mean the robbery from another nation of all its moveable property, and bringing home the spoil, or the imposition of enormous tributes upon its growing produce. This was the mode practised by the Romans in the latter periods of the republic, and under the earliest emperors. 

This is an expedient of the same nature, as the acquirement of wealth by individual acts of illegal violence or fraud. There is no actual production, but a mere appropriation of the products of others. I mention this method of acquiring wealth, once for all, without meaning to recommend it as either safe or honourable. Had the Romans followed the contrary system with equal perseverance, had they studied to spread civilization among their savage neighbours, and to establish a friendly intercourse that might have engendered reciprocal wants, the Roman power would probably have existed to this day.

The production of colonies, formed upon the ancient system, is inconsiderable at the commencement; but increases with
great rapidity. The colonists choose for their country of adoption a spot where the soil is fertile, the climate genial, or the position advantageous for commercial purposes. 

The land is generally quite fresh, whether it have been the scene of a dense population long since extinguished, or merely the range of roving tribes, too small in number and strength to exhaust the productive qualities of the soil.

Families transplanted from a civilized to an entirely new country, carry with them theoretical and practical knowledge, which
is one of the chief elements of productive industry= they carry likewise habits of industry, calculated to set these elements in activity, as well as the habit of subordination, so essential to the preservation of social order; they commonly take with them some little capital also, not in money, but in tools and stock of different kinds= moreover, they have no landlord to share the produce of a virgin soil, far exceeding in extent what they are able to bring into cultivation for years to come. 

To these causes of rapid prosperity, should, perhaps, be superadded the chief cause of all, the natural desire of mankind to better their condition, and to render as comfortable as possible the mode of life they have adopted.
