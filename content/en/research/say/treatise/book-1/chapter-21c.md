## Section 3: The Accession of Value a Commodity receives by being Vested with the Character of Money

Money is currency, not because of the authority of the government, but because it is a commodity bearing a peculiar and intrinsic value. 

But its preference, as an object of exchange, to all other commodities of equivalent value, is owing to its
characteristic properties as money; and to the peculiar advantage it derives from its employment in that character;
namely, the advantage of being in universal use and request.

The whole population, from the lowest degree of poverty to the highest of wealth, must effect exchanges, must buy the
objects of want; must be consumers of money; or, in other words, must obtain possession of the commodity, that acts as
the medium of exchange, the commodity generally admitted to be best suited, and most frequently employed for that pur-
pose. 

A man that has any other commodity, jewels, for instance, to offer in exchange for the necessaries or luxuries he may have occasion for, cannot get those necessaries or luxuries by the process of exchange, until he has found a consumer for his jewels; nor can he even then be sure, that such a consumer will be able to give him, in return, the very identical article he may want= whereas, a man, with money in his
pocket, is quite certain, that it will be acceptable to the person, of whom he would buy any thing; because that person
will, in turn, be himself obliged to become a purchaser in like
manner. 240 

With the commodity, money, he can obtain all he wants by a single act of exchange only, called a purchase; whereas, with all others two acts at least are necessary; a sale and a purchase. This is the sum total of its advantages in the
character of money= but it must be obvious to every body,
that the preference, thus shown it as money, is a consequence
of its actual use as such.

Hence it naturally follows, that these metals being, by reason of their employment as money, raised to such a price, as precludes their so general use in the form of plate and jewellery,
it is in consequence found less convenient to use them in that
form. The luxury costs more than it is worth. Thus, massive
gold plate has gone completely out of fashion, particularly in
those countries, where the activity of commerce, and the rapid
progress of wealth, make gold in great demand for the pur-
poses of money. The richest individuals content themselves
with gilt plate, that is to say, plate covered with a very thin
coat of gold; solid gold is used only in smaller articles of
manufacture, and those in which the value of the workman-
ship exceeds that of the metal. In England, plate is made very
light, and people of affluence often content themselves with
silver-plated goods. The ostentation of displaying a large ser-
vice of that metal costs the interest of a considerable capital.
The increase of the value of metals is, generally speaking,
attended with some disadvantages; inasmuch as it places many
articles of comfort and convenience, silver dishes, spoons,
&c., beyond the reach of most private families; but there is
no disadvantage in such increased value of the metal in its
character of money; on the contrary, there is a greater conve-
nience in the transfer of a less bulky commodity, on every
change of residence, and every act of exchange.

The selection of any commodity, to act as money in but one part of the world, increases its value everywhere else. There
is no doubt, that, if silver should cease to be current as money
in Asia, the value of that metal in Europe would be affected,
and more of it would be given in exchange for all other com-
I must here observe, that the adoption of any specific com-
modity to serve as money, considerably augments its intrin-
sic value, or value as an article of commerce. A new use be-
ing discovered for the commodity, it unavoidably becomes
more in request; the employment of a great part, the half or


1,200,000,000 lbs. weight of sugar. Why? Because the busi-
ness of circulating all the values of England required no larger
value. No government has the power of increasing the total
national money otherwise than nominally. The increased quan-
tity of the whole reduces the value of every part; and vice
versa. 245

modities; for one use of silver in Europe is, the possibility of
exporting it to Asia.
The employment of the precious metals as money by no means
renders their value stationary; they remain subject to local as
well as temporary fluctuations of value, like every other ob-
ject of commerce. In China, half an ounce of silver will pur-
chase as many objects of use or pleasure as an ounce in France;
and an ounce of silver in France will generally go much far-
ther in the purchase of commodities, than it will in America.
Silver is more valuable in China than in France, and in France than in America.

Since the national money, whatever be its material, must have
a peculiar and inherent value, originating in its employment
in that character, it forms an item of national wealth, in the
same manner as sugar, indigo, wheat, and all the other com-
modities that the nation may happen to possess. 246 It fluctu-
ates in value like other commodities; and like them, too, is
consumed, though less rapidly than most of them. Where-
fore, it would be wrong to subscribe to the opinion of
Garnier, 247 who lays it down as a maxim, that, “so long as
silver remains in the shape of money, it is not an item of ac-
tual wealth in the strict sense of the word; for it does not
directly and immediately satisfy a want or procure an enjoy-
ment.” There are abundance of values incapable of satisfying
a want, or procuring an enjoyment, in their present existing
shape. A merchant may have his warehouse full of indigo,
which is of no use in its actual state, either as food or as cloth-
ing; yet it is nevertheless an item of wealth, and one that can
be converted, at will, into another value fit for immediate
use. Silver, in the shape of crown pieces, is, therefore, equally
an article of wealth with indigo in chests. Besides, is not the
utility of money an object of desire in civilized society?
Thus money, or specie, as some people call it, is a commod-
ity, whose value is determined by the same general laws, as
that of all other commodities; that is to say, rises and falls in
proportion to the relative demand and supply. And so intense
is that demand, as to have sometimes been sufficient to make
paper, employed as money, equal in value to gold of the same
denomination; of which the money of Great Britain is a present
example.

It must not be imagined, that the paper money of that country
derives its value from the promise of payment in specie, which
it purports to convey. That promise has been held out ever
since the suspension of cash payments by the bank in 1797,
without any attempt at performance, which many people con-
sider impossible. 243 Gold is only procurable piecemeal, and
by payment of an agio or percentage; in other words, by giv-
ing a larger amount in paper for a smaller amount in gold. Yet
the paper, though depreciated, is invested with value far ex-
ceeding that of its flimsy material. Whence, then, is that value
derived? From the urgent want, in a very advanced stage of
society and of industry, of some agent oi medium of exchange.
England, in its actual state, requires, for the effectuation of
its sales and purchases, an agent or medium equal in value,
say to 1,284,000 lbs. weight of gold; or, what is the same
thing, to 1,200,000,000 lbs. weight of sugar; or, what is still
the same thing, to £60,000,000 sterling of paper, taking the
Bank of England paper at 30 millions, and the paper of the
country banks at as much more. 244 This is the reason, why the
60 millions of paper, though destitute of intrinsic value, are,
by the mere want of a medium of exchange, made equal in
value to 1,284,000 lbs. weight of gold, or 1,200,000,000 lbs.
weight of sugar.

Indeed, the same writer elsewhere admits that, “specie in the
coffers of an individual is real wealth, an integral part of his
substance, which he may immediately devote to his personal
enjoyment; although, in the eye of political economy, this same
coin is a mere instrument of exchange, essentially differing
from the wealth it helps to circulate.” 248 I hope what I have
said is quite sufficient to show the complete analogy of specie
to all other items of wealth. Whatever is wealth to an indi-
vidual, is wealth to the nation, which is but an aggregate of
many individuals; and is wealth also in the eye of political
economy, which must not be misled by the notion of imagi-
nary value, or regard as value any thing, but what, all the
members of the community, individually, as well as jointly,
treat as value, not nominal, but actual. And this is one proof
more, that there are not two kinds of truth in this, more than
in any other science. What is true in relation to an individual,
is true in relation to the government, and to the community.
Truth is uniform; in the application only can there be any
variety.

As a proof that this paper has a peculiar and inherent value,
when its credit was the same as at present, and its volume or
nominal amount was enlarged, its value fell in proportion to
the enlargement, just like that of any other commodity. And,
as all other commodities rose in price, in proportion to the
depreciation of the paper, its total value never exceeded the
same amount of 1,284,000 lbs. weight of gold, or,
