Civilized nations are still unenlightened and ignorant! 

<!--  are the very nations we
term ! Survey entire provinces of proud Europe; in-
terrogate a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand indi-
viduals, and of this whole number, you will hardly, perhaps,
find two embued with the slightest tincture of the improved
science of which the present age so much boasts. This gen-
eral ignorance of recondite truths is by no means so remark-
able as an utter unacquaintance with the simplest rudiments
of knowledge applicable to the situation and circumstances
of everyone. How rare, also, are the qualifications necessary
for oneâ€™s own instruction, and how few persons are solely
capable of observing what daily happens, and of questioning
whatever they do not understand! -->


If we take the pains to inquire what that is, which mankind in a social state of existence denominate wealth, we shall find the term employed to designate an indefinite quantity of objects bearing inherent value, as of land, of metal, of coin, of grain, of stuffs, of commodities of every description. 

When they further extend its signification to landed securities, bills, notes of hand, and the like, it is evidently because they contain obligations to deliver things possessed of inherent value.
In point of fact, wealth can only exist where there are things possessed of real and intrinsic value.

The highest branches of knowledge are then very far from having yielded to society all the advantages to be expected
from them, and without which they would be mere curious speculations. Perhaps their perfect application is reserved for
the nineteenth century. In moral as well as in physical science, inquirers of superior minds will appear, who, after hav-
ing extended their theoretical views, will disclose methods of placing important truths within the reach of the humblest capacities. 

In the ordinary occurrences of life, instead of then being guided by the false lights of a transcendental philoso-
phy, mankind will be governed by the maxims of common sense. Opinions will not rest on gratuitous assumptions, but
be the result of an accurate observation of the nature of things.
Thus, habitually and naturally ascending to the source of all
truth, we shall not suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by
empty sounds, or submit to the guidance of erroneous im-
pressions. Corruption, deprived of the weapons of empiri-
cism, will lose her principal strength, and no longer be able
to obtain triumphs, calamitous to honest men, and disastrous
to nations.

Wealth is proportionate to the quantum of that value; great, when the aggregate of component value is great; small, when
that aggregate is small. 

The value of a specific article is always vague and arbitrary, so long as it remains unacknowl-
edged. Its owner is not a jot the richer, by setting a higher
ratio upon it in his own estimation. But the moment that other
persons are willing, for the purpose of obtaining it, to give in
exchange a certain quantity of other articles, likewise bear-
ing value, the one may then be said to be worth, or to be of
equal value with, the other.

The quantity of money, which is readily parted with to obtain a thing, is called its price. Current price, at a given time and
place, is that price which the owner is sure of obtaining for a
thing, if he is inclined to part with it. 40

The knowledge of the real nature of wealth, thus defined, of the difficulties that must be surmounted in its attainment, of
the course and order of its distribution amongst the members of society, of the uses to which it may be applied, and, fur-
ther, of the consequences resulting respectively from these several circumstances, constitutes that branch of science now
entitled Political Economy.

The value that mankind attach to objects originates in the use it can make of them. Some afford sustenance; others serve
for clothing; some defend them from the inclemencies of the season, as houses; others gratify their taste, or, at all events,
their vanity, both of which are species of wants= of this class
are all mere ornaments and decorations. 

When men attribute value to any thing, it is in consideration of its useful properties; what is good for nothing they
set no price upon. 41 To this inherent fitness or capability of
certain things to satisfy the various wants of mankind, I shall

viz. 1. Its real value originating in its utility= 2. The value of
the tax that the government thinks fit to exact, for permitting
its manufacture, transport, or consumption.

take leave to affix the name of utility. 

To create objects which have any kind of utility, is to create wealth. The utility of things is the ground-work of their value. Their value constitutes wealth.

Wherefore, there is no actual production of wealth, without a creation or augmentation of utility. Let us see in what manner
this utility is to be produced.

Objects, however, cannot be created by human means; nor is the mass of matter, of which this globe consists, capable of
increase or diminution. All that man can do is, to re-produce existing materials under another form, which may give them
an utility they did not before possess, or merely enlarge one they may have before presented. 

So that, in fact, there is a
creation, not of matter, but of utility; and this I call production of wealth.
