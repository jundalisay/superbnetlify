Production is the creation of utility, not matter. It is not to be estimated by the length, the bulk, or the weight of the product, but by the utility it presents.

Some items of human consumption are the spontaneous gifts of nature, and require no exertion of man for their production; as air, water, and light, under certain circumstances.

These are destitute of exchangeable value; because the want of them is never felt, others being equally provided with them
as ourselves. Being neither procurable by production, nor destructible by consumption, they come not within the province of political economy.

Price is the measure of the value of things, and their value the measure of their utility. But it would be absurd to draw
the inference, that, by forcibly raising their price, their= utility can be augmented. Exchangeable value, or price, is an
index of the recognised utility of a thing, so long only as human dealings are exempt from every influence but that of the
identical utility in like manner as a barometer denotes the weight of the atmosphere, only while the mercury is submitted to the exclusive action of atmospheric gravity.

But there are abundance of others equally indispensable to  our existence and to our happiness, which man would never enjoy at all, did not his industry awaken, assist, or complete the operations of nature. Such are most of the articles which
serve for his food, raiment and lodging.

In fact, when one man sells any product to another, he sells
him the utility vested in that product; the buyer buys it only
for the sake of its utility, of the use he can make of it. 

If, by any cause whatever, the buyer is obliged to pay more than the
value to himself of that utility, he pays for value that has no
existence, and consequent ly which he does not receive. 42

When that industry is limited to the bare collection of natural products, it is called agricultural industry, or simply agriculture.

When it is employed in severing, compounding, or fashioning the products of nature, so as to fit them to the satisfaction
of our various wants, it is called manufacturing industry. 44

This is precisely the case, when authority grants to a particular class of merchants the exclusive privilege of carrying on a
certain branch of trade, the India trade for instance; the price of Indian imports is thereby raised, without any accession to
their utility or intrinsic value. 

This excess of price is nothing more or less than so much money transferred from the pockets of the consumers into those of the privileged traders, whereby the latter are enriched exactly as much as the former are unnecessarily impoverished. 

In like manner, when a government imposes on wine a tax, which raises to 15 cents the
bottle what would otherwise be sold for 10 cents, what does it else, but transfer 5 cents per bottle from the hands of the
producers or the consumers of wine to those of the tax-gatherer? 43 

The particular commodity is here only the means resorted to for getting at the tax-payer with more or less conve-
nience; and its current value is composed of two ingredients,
When it is employed in placing within our reach objects of
want which would otherwise be beyond reach, it is called
commercial industry, or simply commerce.

It is solely by means of industry that mankind can be furnished, in any degree of abundance, with actual necessaries,
and with that variety of other objects, the use of which, though
not altogether indispensable, yet marks the distinction between
a civilized community and a tribe of savages. 

Nature, left entirely to itself, would provide a very scanty subsistence to
a small number of human beings. Fertile but desert tracts have
been found inadequate to the bare nourishment of a few
wretches, cast upon them by the chances of shipwreck= while
the presence of industry often exhibits the spectacle of a dense
population plentifully supplied upon the most un. grateful soil.

wealth is to be created by the annexation of value. Practically, the man who has in his warehouse a quintal of wool
worked up into fine cloths, is richer than one who has the same quantity of wool in packs.
The term products is applied to things that industry furnishes to mankind.

A particular product is rarely the fruit of one branch of industry exclusively. A table is a joint product of agricultural in-
dustry, which has felled the tree whereof it is made, and of manufacturing industry, which has given it form. Europe is
indebted for its coffee to the agricultural industry, which has planted and cultivated the bean in Arabia or elsewhere, and
to the commercial industry, which hands it over to the consumer.

To this position the economists replied, that the additional value communicated to a product by manufacture, was no
more than equivalent to the value consumed by the manufacturer during the process; for, said they, the competition of
manufactures prevents their ever raising the price beyond the
bare amount of their own expenditure and consumption;
wherefore their labour adds nothing to the total wealth of the
community, because their wants on the one side destroy as
much as their industry produces on the other. 46

These 3 branches of industry, which may at pleasure be again infinitely subdivided, are uniform in their mode of contributing to the act of production. They all either confer an utility on a substance that possessed none before, or increase
one which it already possessed. 

The husbandman who sows a grain of wheat that yields twenty-fold, does not gain this prod-
uct from nothing= he avails himself of a powerful agent; that
is to say, of Nature, and merely directs an operation, whereby
different substances previously scattered throughout the ele-
ments of earth, air, and water, are converted into the form of
grains of wheat.

But it should have been previously demonstrated by those who made use of this argument, that the value, consumed by
mechanics and artizans, must of necessity barely equal the value produced by them, which is not the fact; for it is unquestionable, that more savings are made, and more capital accumulated from the profits of trade and manufacture, than from those of agriculture. 47

Besides, even admitting that the profits of manufacturing industry are consumed in the satisfaction of the necessary wants
of the manufacturers and their families, that circumstance does
not prevent them being positive acquisitions of wealth. 

For unless they were so, they could not satisfy their wants the profits of the land-owner and agriculturist are allowed to be
items of positive wealth; yet they are equally consumed in the maintenance of those classes.

Gall-nuts, sulphate of iron, and gum-arabic, are substances existing separately in nature. The joint industry of the merchant and manufacturer brings them together, and from their compound derives the black liquid, applied to the transmission of useful science. 

This joint operation of the merchant and manufacturer is analogous to that of the husbandman, who chooses his object and effects its attainment by precisely the same kind of means as the other two.

Commercial, in like manner as manufacturing industry, concurs in production, by augmenting the value of a product by
its transport from one place to another. A quintal of Brazil cotton has acquired greater utility, and therefore larger value,
by the time it reaches a warehouse in Europe, than it possessed in one at Pernambuco. The transport is a modification
that the trader gives to the commodity, whereby he adapts to our use what was not before available; which modification is
equally useful, complex and uncertain in the result, as any it derives from the other two branches of industry. 

He avails himself of the natural properties of the timber and the metals used in the construction of his ships, of the hemp whereof his
rigging is composed, of the wind that fills his sails, of all the natural agents brought to concur in his purpose, with precisely the same view and the same result, and in the same
manner too, as the agriculturist avails himself of the earth,
the rain, and the atmosphere. 48

No human being has the faculty of originally creating matter, which is more than nature itself can do. But any one may
avail himself of the agents offered him by nature, to invest matter with utility. In fact, industry is nothing more or less
than the human employment of natural agents; the most perfect product of labour, the one that derives nearly its whole
value from its workmanship, is probably the result of the action of steel, a natural product upon some substance or other,
likewise a natural product. 45

Through ignorance of this principle, the economists of the 18th century, though many enlightened writers were to be
reckoned amongst them, were betrayed into the most serious errors. They allowed no- industry to be productive, but that
which procured the raw materials; as the industry of the husbandman, the fisherman and the miner; not adverting to the
distinction, that wealth consists, not in matter, but in the value
of matter; because matter without value is no item of wealth; otherwise water, flint-stones, and dust of the roads, would be
wealth. 

Wherefore, if the value of matter constitutes wealth,

Thus, when Raynal says of commerce, as contrasted with
agriculture and the arts, that “it produces nothing of itself,”
he shows himself to have had no just conception of the phe-
27Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
they at the same time consume an equivalent product, fur-
nished by the real producers= manufacturing and commercial
nations, therefore, subsist wholly upon the wages they receive
from their agricultural customers; in proof of which position,

nomenon of production. In this instance Raynal has fallen
into the same error with regard to commerce, as the econo-
mists made respecting both commerce and manufacture. They
pronounced agriculture to be the sole channel of production;
Raynal refers production to the two channels of agriculture
and manufacture= his position is nearer the truth than the other,
but still is erroneous.

The truth is, that, in whatever class of industry a person is
engaged, he subsists upon the profit he derives from the addi-
tional value, or portion of value, no matter in what ratio, which
his agency attaches to the product he is at work upon. The
total value of products serves in this way to pay the profits of
those occupied in production. The wants of mankind are sup-
plied and satisfied out of the gross values produced and cre-
ated, and not out of the net values only.

Condillac also is confused in his endeavour to explain the
mode in which commerce produces. He pretends that, be-
cause all commodities cost to the seller less than the buyer,
they derive an increase of value from the mere act of transfer
from one hand to another. But this is not so; for, since a sale
is nothing else but an act of barter, in which one kind of goods,
silver for example, is received in lieu of another kind of goods,
the loss which either of the parties dealing should sustain on
one article would be equivalent to the profit he would make
on the other, and there would be to the community no pro-
duction of value whatsoever. 49 When Spanish wine is bought
at Paris, equal value is really given for equal value= the silver
paid, and the wine received, are worth one the other; but the
wine had not the same value before its export from Alicant:
its value has really increased in the hands of the trader, by the
circumstance of transport, and not by the circumstance, or at
the moment, of exchange.

A nation, or a class of a nation, engaged in manufacturing or
commercial industry, is not a whit more or less in the pay of
another, than one employed in agriculture. The value created
by one branch is of the same nature as that created by others.
Two equal values are worth one the other, although perhaps
the fruit of different branches of industry= and when Poland
barters its staple product, wheat, for the staple commodity of
Holland, East and West India produce, Holland is no more in
the pay or service of Poland, than Poland is of Holland.
The seller does not play the rogue, nor the buyer the fool; and
Condillac has no grounds for his position, that “ if men al-
ways exchanged equal value for equal value, there would be
no profit to be made by the traders.” 50
Nay, Poland herself, which exports at the rate of ten millions
of wheat annually, and therefore, according to the economists,
takes the sure road to national wealth, is, notwithstanding,
poor and depopulated= and why? — Because she confines
her industry to agriculture, though she might be at the same
time a commercial and manufacturing state. Instead of keep-
ing Holland in her pay, she may with more propriety be said
to receive wages from the latter, for the raising of ten mil-
lions of wheat, per annum. Nor is she a jot less dependent
than the nations that buy wheat of her= for she has just as
much desire to sell to them, as they have to buy of her. 53
In some particular cases the two other branches of industry
produce in a manner analogous to commerce, viz., by giving
a value to things to which they actually communicate no new
quality, but that of approximation to the consumer. Of this
description is the industry of miners. The coal or metal may
exist in the earth, in a perfect state, but unpossessed of value.
The miner extracts them thence, and this operation gives them
a value, by fitting them for the use of mankind. So also of the
herring fishery. Whether in or out of the sea, the fish is the
same; but under the latter circumstances, it has acquired an
utility, a value, it did not before possess. 51
Moreover, it is not true that Colbert ruined France. On the
contrary, the fact is that France, under Colbert’s administra-
tion, emerged from the distress that two regencies and a weak
reign had involved her in. She was, indeed, afterwards ruined
again; but for this second calamity, she may thank the pag-
eantry and the wars of Louis XIV. Nay, the very prodigality
of that prince is an undeniable evidence of the vast resources
that Colbert had placed at his disposal. It must, however, be
admitted that those resources would have been still more
ample, if he had but given the same protection to agriculture,
as to the other branches of industry.

Examples might be infinitely multiplied, and would all bear as close an affinity, as those natural objects, which the natu-
ralist classifies only to facilitate their description. This fundamental error of the economists, in which I have shown that
their adversaries in some measure participated, led them to the strangest conclusions. According to their theory, the trad-
ers and manufacturers, being unable to add an iota to the general stock of wealth, live entirely at the expense of the sole
producers, that is to say, the proprietors and cultivators of the
land. Whatever new value they may communicate to things,

The means of enlarging and multiplying wealth within the reach of every community are much less confined than the economists imagined. A nation, by their


Wealth, which consists in the
value that human industry, in aid and furtherance of natural
agents, communicates to things, is susceptible of creation and
destruction, of increase and diminution, within the limits of
each nation and independently of external agency, according
to the method it adopts to bring about those effects.

account, was unable to produce annually any values beyond
the net annual produce of its lands; to which fund alone recourse could be had for the support not only of the propri-
etary and the idler, but likewise of the merchant, the manufacturer, and the mechanic, as well as for the total consump-
tion of the government. Whereas we have just seen that the annual produce of a nation is composed, not of the mere net
produce of its agriculture, but of the gross produce of its ag-
riculture, commerce, and manufacture united. For, in fact, is
not the sum total, that is to say, the aggregate of the gross
product raised by the nation, disposable for its consumption?

Is value produced less an item of wealth, because it must needs be consumed? And does not value itself originate in this very applicability to consumption.
