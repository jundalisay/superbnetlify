Governments that have been perpetually pressed with the lack of money have been obliged into the most ruinous expedients to extricate themselves. 

- Charles the Bald put his titles and safe-conducts up for sale.
- Charles 2nd of England:
  - sold Dunkirk to the French king
  - took a bribe of £80,000 from the Dutch, to delay the sailing of the English expedition to the East Indies, 1680, intended to protect their settlements in that quarter, which, in consequence, fell into the hands of the Dutchmen. 38 

<!-- Thus,  too, have governments committed frequent acts of bankruptcy, sometimes in the shape of adulteration of their coin, and some-times by open breach of their engagements. -->

- Louis 14th towards the close of his reign utterly exhausted his resources
  - He had to create the most ridiculous offices, making his counsellors of state, one an inspector of fagots, another a
licenser of barber-wigmakers, another, visiting inspector of fresh, or taster of salt, butter, and the like.

Such paltry and mischievous expedients can never long defer the hour of calamities, that must sooner or later befal the extravagant and spendthrift governments. 

“When a man will not listen to reason,” says Franklin, “she is sure to make herself felt.”


Since all consumption by the public is in itself a sacrifice of value, an evil balanced only by such benefit, as may result to the community from the satisfaction of any of its wants, a good administration will never spend for the mere sake of spending, but take care to ascertain that the public benefit, resulting, in such instance, from the satisfaction of a public want, shall exceed the sacrifice incurred in its acquirement.

A comprehensive view of the principal public wants of a civilized community, can alone qualify us to estimate with tolerable accuracy the sacrifice it is worth while for the community to make for their gratification. 40


The public consumes little else, but what have been denominated Immaterial products, that is to say, products destroyed as soon as created; in other words, the services or agency, either of human beings, or of other objects, animate or inanimate.

It consumes the personal service of all its functionaries, civil, judicial, military, or ecclesiastical. It consumes the agency of land and capital. The navigation of rivers and seas, utility of roads and ground open to the public, are so much agency derived by the public from land, of which either the absolute property, or the beneficial enjoyment, is vested in the public. 

Where capital has been vested in the land, in the shape of buildings, bridges, artificial harbours, causeways, dikes, canals, &c. the public then consumes the agency, or the rent of the land, plus the agency, or the interest, of the capital so vested.


Sometimes the public maintains establishments of productive industry for instance, the porcelain manufacture of Sevres, the Gobelin tapestry, the salt-works of Lorraine and of the Jura, &c., in France. When concerns of this kind bring more than their expenditure, which is but rarely the case, they furnish part of the national revenue, and must by no means be classed among the items of national charge.


Fortunately, an economical administration soon repairs the mischiefs of one of an opposite character. Sound health can not be restored all at once; but there is a gradual and perceptible improvement; every day some cause of complaint disappears, and some new faculty comes again into play. 

Half  the remaining resources of a nation, impoverished by an extravagant administration, are neutralized by alarm and uncertainty; whereas, credit 39 doubles those of a nation, blessed with one of a frugal character. It would seem, that there exists in the politic, to a stronger degree than even in the natural, body a principle of vitality and elasticity, which can not be extinguished without the most violent pressure. 

One can not look into the pages of history, without being struck with the rapidity, with which this principle has operated. It has nowhere been more strikingly exemplified, than in the frequent vicissitudes that our own France has experienced since the commencement of the revolution. 

Prussia has afforded another illustration in our time. The successor of Frederick the Great squandered the accumulations of that monarch, which were estimated at no less a sum than 42 millions of dollars, and left behind him, besides, a debt of 27 millions.

In less than eight years, Frederick William III had not only paid off his father’s debts, but actually began a fresh accumulation; such is the power of economy, even in a country of limited extent and resources.



## The Charge of Civil and Judicial Administration

The charge of civil and judicial administration is made up, partly of the specific allowances of magistrates and other officers, and partly of such degree of pomp and parade, as may be deemed necessary in the execution of their duties. 

Even if the burthen of that pomp and parade be thrown wholly or partially upon the public functionary, it must ultimately fall upon the shoulders of the public, for the salary of the functionary must be raised, in proportion to the appearance he is expected to make.

This applies to every description of functionary, from the prince to the constable inclusive consequently, a nation, which reverences its prince only when surrounded with the externals of greatness, with guards, horse
and foot, laced liveries, and such costly trappings of royalty,
must pay dearly for its taste. If, on the contrary, it can be
content, to respect simplicity rather than pageantry, and obey
the laws, though unaided by the attributes of pomp and cer-
emony, it will save in proportion. This is what made the
charges of government so light in many of the Swiss cantons,
before the revolution, and in the North American colonies
before their emancipation. It is well known, that those colo-
nies, though under the dominion of England, had separate
governments, of which they respectively defrayed the charge;
yet the whole annual expenditure all together amounted to no
more than £64,700 sterling. “An ever memorable example,”
observes Smith, “at how small an expense three millions of
people may not only be governed, but well governed.” 42


On the other hand, a public duty may be cheap, although very liberally paid. A low salary is wholly thrown away upon an
incapable and inefficient officer; his ignorance will probably cost the public ten times the amount of his salary; but the
knowledge and activity of a man of ability are fully equivalent to the pay he receives; the losses he saves to the public,
and the benefits derived from his exertions, greatly outweigh his personal emolument, even if settled on the most liberal scale.

There is real economy in procuring the best of every thing, even at a larger price. Merit can seldom be engaged at a low
rate, because it is applicable to more occupations than one. 

The talent, that makes an able minister, would, in another profession, make a good advocate, physician, farmer, or mer-
chant; and merit will find both employment and emolument in all these departments. If the public service offer no ad-
equate reward for its exertion, it will choose some other more
promising occupation.

Causes entirely of a political nature as well as the form of government which they help to determine, have an influence
in apportioning the salaries of public officers, civil and judicial, the charge of public display, and those likewise of pub-
lic institutions and establishments. 

Thus, in a despotic government, where the subject holds his property at the will of the sovereign, who fixes himself the charge of his household, that is to say, the amount of the public money which he chooses to spend on his personal necessities and pleasures, and the
keeping up of the royal establishment, that charge will probably be fixed at a higher rate, than where it is arranged and
contested between the representatives of the prince and of the tax payers respectively.

Integrity is like talent; it can not be had without paying for it, which is not at all wonderful; for the honest man can not re-
sort to those discreditable shifts and contrivances, which dishonesty looks to as a supplemental resource.

The salaries of inferior public officers in like manner depend,
partly upon their individual importance, and partly upon the
general plan of government. Their services are dear or cheap
to the public, not merely in proportion to what they actually
cost, but likewise in proportion as they are well or ill ex-
ecuted. A duty ill performed is dearly bought, however little
be paid for it; it is dear too, if it be superfluous, or unneces-
sary; resembling in this respect an article of furniture, that, if
it do not answer its purpose, or be not wanted, is merely use-
less lumber. Of this description, under the old regime of
France, were the officers of high-admiral, high-steward of
the household, the king’s cup-bearer, the master of his hounds,
and a variety of others, which added nothing even to the
splendour of royalty, and were merely so many means of dis-
pensing personal favour and emolument.

For the same reason, whenever the officers of government are needlessly multiplied, the people are saddled with charges,
which are not necessary to the maintenance of public order. It
is only giving an unnecessary form to that benefit, or prod-
uct, which is not at all the better of it, if indeed it be not
worse. 43 A bad government, that can not support its violence,
injustice, and exaction, without a multitude of mercenaries,
satellites, and spies, and gaols innumerable, makes its sub-
jects pay for its prisons, spies, and soldiers, which nowise
contribute to the public happiness.
