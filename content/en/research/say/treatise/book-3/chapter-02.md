The immediate effect of consumption of every kind is, the loss of value, consequently, of wealth, to the owner of the article consumed. This is the invariable and inevitable consequence, and should never be lost sight of in reasoning on this
matter. 

A product consumed is a value lost to all the world and to all eternity; but the further consequence, that may follow, will depend upon the circumstances and nature of the consumption.

fore, in common parlance, to spend and to consume have become nearly synonymous. Yet, by the mere act of buying,
the value expended is not lost; for the article purchased has likewise a value, which may be parted with again for what it
cost, if it has not been bought over-dear. The loss of value does not happen till the actual consumption, after which the
value is destroyed; it then ceases to exist, and is not the object of a second consumption. 

This is why in domestic life, the bad management of the wife soon runs through a moderate fortune; for she in general regulates the daily consumption of the family, which is the chief source of expense, and one that is always recurring. 

If the consumption be unproductive, there usually results the gratification of some want, but no reproduction of value what-
ever; if productive, there results the satisfaction of no want, but a creation of new value, equal, inferior, or superior in
amount to that consumed, and profitable or unprofitable to the adventurer accordingly. 6

This will serve to expose the error of the notion, that where there is no loss of money, there can be no loss of wealth. It is
the commonest thing in the world to hear it roundly asserted, that the money spent is not lost, but remains in the country;
and, therefore, that the country cannot be impoverished by its internal expenditure. It is true, the value of the money re-
mains as before; but the object, or the hundred objects, perhaps, that have been successively bought with the same money,
have been consumed, and their value destroyed.

Thus, consumption may be regarded as an act of barter,
wherein the owner of the value consumed gives up that value
on the one hand, and receives in return, either the satisfaction
of a personal want, or a fresh value, equivalent to the value consumed.

Consumption that produces nothing beyond a present gratification, requires no
skill or talent in the consumer. It requires neither labour nor
ingenuity to eat a good dinner, or dress in fine clothes. 7 On
the contrary, productive consumption, besides yielding no
immediate or present gratification, requires an exertion of
combined labour and skill, or, of what has all along been denominated, industry.

Wherefore, it is superfluous, I had almost said ridiculous, to
confine at home the national money, for the purpose of pre-
serving national wealth. Money by no means prevents the
consumption of value, and the consequent diminution of
wealth; on the contrary, it facilitates the arrival of consum-
able objects at their ultimate destination; which is a most ben-
eficial act, when the end is well chosen, and the result satis-
factory. Nor would it be correct even to maintain, that the
export of specie is at all events a loss, although its presence
in the country may be no hindrance to consumption or to the
diminution of wealth. For unless it be made without any view
to a return, which is rarely the case, it is in fact the same thing
as productive consumption; being merely a sacrifice of one
value, for the purpose of obtaining another. Where no return
whatever is in view, there indeed is so much loss of national capital; but the loss would be quite as great, were goods, and
not money, so exported.

When the owner of a product ready for consumption has him-
self no industrious faculty, and wishes, but knows not how to
consume it productively, he lends it to some one more indus-
trious than himself, who commences by destroying it, but in
such a way, as to reproduce another, and thereby enable him-
self to make a full restitution to the lender, after retaining the
profit of his own skill and labour. The value returned consists
of different objects from that lent, it is true; indeed, the con-
dition of a loan is in substance this; to replace the value lent,
of whatever amount, say 2000 dollars, at a time specified, by
other value, equivalent to the same amount of silver coin of
the like weight and quality at the time of repayment. An ob-
ject, lent on condition of specific restitution, cannot be avail-
able for reproduction; because, by the terms of the loan, it is
not to be consumed.


Sometimes a producer is the consumer of his own product; as when the farmer eats his own poultry or vegetables; or the
clothier wears his own cloth. But, the objects of human consumption being far more varied and numerous, than the ob-
jects of each personâ€™s production respectively, most operations of consumption are preceded by a process of barter. He
first turns into money, or receives in that shape, the values composing his individual revenue; and then changes again
that money for the articles he purposes to consume. Where
