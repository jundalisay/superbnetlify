## PART 1

Justice is useful to society. This gives it its merit. <!--  , and consequently that PART of its merit, at least, must arise from that consideration, it would be a superfluous undertaking to prove.  -->

But is public utility the SOLE origin of justice?

Are the benefits of justice the SOLE foundation of its merit?

Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse ABUNDANCE of all EXTERNAL conveniencies, that, without any uncertainty in the event, without any care or industry on our part, every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites can want, or luxurious imagination wish or desire. 

His natural beauty surpasses all acquired ornaments. 

The perpetual clemency of the seasons renders all clothes or covering useless. 

The raw herbs afford him the most delicious fare.

The clear fountain, the richest beverage. 

The following are not needed:
- any laborious occupation
- tillage
- navigation. 

His sole activities would be:
- music
- poetry
- contemplation
- conversation
- mirth
- friendship

In such a happy state:
- social virtues would flourish and increase tenfold. 
- the cautious, jealous virtue of justice would never be dreamed of.

Why would we need to divide goods if everyone has more than enough? Why create property when no one is threatened by loss? 

Why call this object MINE, when upon the seizing of it by another, I need but stretch out my hand to possess myself to what is equally valuable? 

In those cases, justice becomes totally useless and would just be for ceremony. <!-- It would be an idle ceremonial, and could never possibly have place in the catalogue of virtues. -->

We see, even in the present necessitous condition of mankind, that, wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance. 

we leave it always in common among the whole human race, and make no subdivisions of right and property. 

Water and air are the most necessary of all objects. No one makes a property of them. No one commits injustice by <!-- , are not challenged as the property of individuals; nor can any man commit injustice by the most --> lavishly drinking water and breathing so much air. <!--  use and enjoyment of these blessings.  -->

In large, fertile countries with few people, land is seen in the same way. The defenders of the liberty of the seas cite the wideness of the oceans. <!--  , as the unexhausted use of them in navigation. --> 

<!-- regarded on the same footing. And no topic is so much insisted on by those, who defend the  Were the advantages, procured by navigation, as inexhaustible, these reasoners had never had any adversaries to refute; nor had any claims ever been advanced of a separate, exclusive dominion over the ocean. -->

Some countries might establish property on water and not on land. But in such a case it is the water-areas that are scarce. <!-- , at some periods, that there be established a property in water, none in land [Footnote=  Genesis, chaps. xiii. and xxi.]; if the latter be in greater abundance than can be used by the inhabitants, and the former be found, with difficulty, and in very small quantities. -->

Imagine all humans filled with friendship and generosity that everyone has perfect fellow-feeling. In such a case, justice would be suspended by benevolence and property and obligatory contracts would not be thought of. 

<!-- Again; suppose, that, though the necessities of human race continue the same as at present, yet the mind is so enlarged, and so replete with 
, that every man has the utmost tenderness for every man, and feels no more concern for his own interest than for that of his fellows; it seems evident, that the use of justice would, in this case, be suspended by such  -->

an extensive benevolence, nor would the divisions and barriers of property and obligation have ever been thought of. 

Why should I bind another, by a deed or promise, to do something for me when he is always working towards my happiness? 

<!--  any good office, when I know that he is already prompted, by the strongest inclination, to seek my happiness
 -->

<!-- , and would, of himself, perform the desired service; except the hurt, he thereby receives, be greater than the benefit accruing to me? in which case, he knows, that, from my innate humanity and friendship, I should be the first to oppose myself to his imprudent generosity.  -->

Why raise fences between my neighbour's field and mine, when we have a united interest and share everything? 

<!-- my heart has made no division between our interests; but shares all his joys and sorrows with the same force and vivacity as if originally my own?  -->

In this case, every man is a second self to another.
- He would trust all his interests to the discretion of every man without jealousy, partition, or distinction. 

**The whole human race would form only one family where everything would be:
**- common property**
**- used freely and cautiously with a regard to the necessities of each individual**

<!--  without regard to property; but  too, with as entire , as if our own interests were most intimately concerned. -->

In the present disposition of the human heart, it would be difficult to find complete instances of such enlarged affections.
- It is seen in families.
<!-- But still we may observe, that the case of  approaches towards it; -->

The stronger the mutual benevolence among the individuals, the nearer this commoness of property becomes until all the distinction of property  is lost and confounded among them. 

Between married persons, the cement of friendship is supposed to be so strong. 
- The laws abolish all division of possessions. 

It has often, in reality, the force ascribed to it.

<!-- , when every principle is inflamed into extravagance,  -->

The commoness <!-- community --> of goods has frequently been attempted during the ardour of new enthusiasms.
- The returning or disguised selfishness of people expose its inconveniencies
- This makes their proponents <!--  imprudent fanatics would adopt anew --> rever to the ideas of justice and of separate property.


## Justice

This virtue of justice derives its existence entirely from its necessary USE to the intercourse and social state of mankind.

<!-- To make this truth more evident, let us reverse the foregoing suppositions; and carrying everything to the opposite extreme, consider what would be the effect of these new situations.  -->

Imagine society fall into a lack of all common necessities. <!--  that the utmost frugality and industry cannot save the majority from perishing and everyone from extreme misery. --> 
- The laws of justice then will be suspended to give way to the stronger motives of necessity and self-preservation. 

Is it a crime for a shipwrecked people to seize whatever object <!--  instrument of safety that --> they can get, and ignore <!-- the former limitations of --> property rules?

If a besieged city were starving, would they still observe the rules of equity and justice?
- The public opens private granaries without the consent of proprietors.
<!--  perishing with hunger; can we imagine, that men will see any means of preservation before them, and lose their lives, from a scrupulous regard to what, in other situations, would be ?  -->

<!-- The use and tendency of justice is to procure happiness and security, by preserving order in society.  -->

<!-- But where the society is ready to perish from extreme necessity, no greater evil can be dreaded from violence and injustice; and every man may now provide for himself by all the means, which prudence can dictate, or humanity permit.  -->

<!-- ; as justly supposing, that the authority of magistracy may, consistent with equity, extend so far. -->

But if men assembled by themselves <!-- , without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction; --> to forcibly and violently equally distribute bread in a famine<!-- , though effected by power and even violence, -->, would it be regarded as criminal or injurious?



Suppose a virtuous man's fate was decided by a society of ruffians<!-- , remote from the protection of laws and government; --> what should he do? 

- Such a society would dissolve sooner or later.

<!-- He sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail; such a disregard to equity, such contempt of order, such stupid blindness to future consequences, as must immediately have the most tragical conclusion, and must terminate in destruction to the greater number, and in a total dissolution of society to the rest.  -->
- He, meanwhile, can have no other expedient than to arm himself. <!-- , to whomever the sword he seizes, or the buckler, may belong=  To make provision of all means of defence and security. -->
- His particular regard to justice being no longer of use to his own safety or that of others, he must consult the dictates of self-preservation alone, without concern for those who no longer merit his care and attention.


When any man, even in political society, renders himself by his crimes, obnoxious to the public, he is punished by the laws in his goods and person; that is, the ordinary rules of justice are, with regard to him, suspended for a moment, and it becomes equitable to inflict on him, for the BENEFIT of society, what otherwise he could not suffer without wrong or injury.

The rage and violence of public war; what is it but a suspension of justice among the warring parties, who perceive, that this virtue is now no longer of any USE or advantage to them? 
s


The laws of equity and justice are succeeded by the laws of war which aim for the ADVANTAGE and UTILITY of that state of war. 

If a civilized nation is engaged with lawless barbarians, then it must also:
- suspend its civilized laws
<!-- . their observance of them, where they no longer serve to any purpose; and must  -->
- render every action against the barbarians as bloody and pernicious as possible

Thus, the rules of equity or justice:
- depend entirely on the state and condition of society
<!-- in which men are placed. -->
- owe their origin and existence to that utility, which is gained by the public from their strict and regular observance. 


Justice is made totally useless when humans are in the state of: 
- extreme abundance or
- extreme necessity

<!-- Reverse, in any considerable circumstance, the condition of men=  Produce =  Implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity, or perfect rapaciousness and malice=  By rendering justice totally USELESS, you thereby totally destroy its essence, and suspend its obligation upon mankind.  -->

The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these extremes.

We are naturally partial to ourselves, and to our friends. But we are capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable conduct.

 

The open and liberal hand of nature gives us few enjoyments. 
- We can extract more enjoyments from nature by art, labour, and industry.

Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all civil society.

Hence justice derives its usefulness to the public.

Hence alone arises its merit and moral obligation.
