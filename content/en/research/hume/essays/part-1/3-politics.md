<!-- It is a question with several, whether there be any essential difference between one form of government and another?

It is wrong to say that all governments are alike, and that their only difference is in the character and conduct of the governors. If this were true, then most political disputes would end and there would be just one constitution for all. <!--  above another, must be esteemed mere bigotry and folly.  -->

<!-- But, though a friend to moderation, I cannot forbear condemning this sentiment, and should be sorry to think, that  -->

I condemn the idea that human affairs are merely caused by <!-- admit of no greater stability, than what they receive from --> the casual humours and characters of particular men.

The goodness of all government is in the goodness of the administration. 

<!-- , may cite many particular instances in history, where the very same government, in different hands, has varied suddenly into the two opposite extremes of good and bad. --> 

Compare the French government under Henry III and Henry IV. 

- Henry III's reign had oppression, levity, and artifice in its rulers, and faction, sedition, treachery, rebellion, disloyalty in its subjects. 
- Henry IV was a patriot and heroic prince who succeeded Henry III. He caused everything to totally change.

The difference was caused by the difference in the temper and conduct of these two sovereigns. Instances of this kind may be multiplied, almost without number, from ancient as well as modern history, foreign as well as domestic.

<!-- But here it may be proper to make a distinction.  -->

All absolute governments depend very much on the administration. This is one of the great inconveniences of absolutism. 

But a republican and free government would be absurd if the checks and balances, from the constitution:
- were impotent, and 
- made no one, even bad men, to act for the public good. 

<!-- Such is the intention of these forms of government, and such is their real effect, where they are wisely constituted:  -->

Governments would be the source of all disorder and of the blackest crimes if skill or honesty were lacking in their original frame and institution.

The force of laws and forms of government are so great. They depend so little on the humours and tempers of men, that both general and specific consequences can be deduced from them sometimes, just like any mathematical formula. 

The Roman republic's constitution gave the whole legislative power to the people, without giving veto power to the nobility or consuls. This unbounded power was in a collective, not in a representative body. 

Conquest enlarged the republic's population size which was spread far from the capital. This caused the votes to be won by the contemptible city-tribes.

Those urban people supported policies that gave them grains and bribes, making them more licentious everyday. The Campus Martius became a perpetual scene of tumult and sedition.

<!-- They were, therefore, most cajoled by every one that affected popularity. They were supported in idleness by the general distribution of grain, and by particular bribes, which they received from almost every candidate. -->

Armed slaves were introduced among these rascally citizens. This caused them to fall into anarchy and forced the Romans into the despotic power of the Caesars. 

Such are the effects of democracy without a representative.


A Nobility may possess the legislative power of a state in two ways: 

> 1. Every nobleman shares the power with the whole body

An example is the Venetian aristocracy. In it, the nobility has the whole power. No nobleman has any authority which he receives not from the whole. 

<!-- , and the whole body has no authority but what it receives from the concurrence of its parts. The different operations and tendencies of these two species of government might be made apparent even a priori.5  -->

> 2. The whole body enjoys power in parts, each having a distinct power and authority. 

An example is the Polish government where every nobleman has a distinct hereditary authority over his vassals through his fiefs, the concurrence of which gives the authority to the whole. 

The Venetian system is better because it avoids the instability of individual interests and education of the Polish system. 



A nobility, who possess their power in common, will preserve peace and order, among themselves and their subjects.

No noble can have enough power to control the laws for a moment. 

The nobles will preserve their authority over the people, but without any grievous tyranny, or any breach of private property. This is because it would not be the interest of the whole body, however it may be for some individuals. 

The only distinction in the state will be a distinction of rank between the nobility and people. The whole nobility will form one body, and the whole people another, without the usual private feuds. This shows the disadvantages of a Polish nobility.

<!--  and animosities, which spread ruin and desolation every where. It is easy to see the disadvantages of a Polish nobility in every one of these particulars. -->

A free government can have a single prince or king holding a large share of power in order to balance the other parts of the legislature. This chief magistrate may be elected or be hereditary. The hereditary way leads to more inconveniencies than the elective way. This election will to divide the whole people into factions. Upon every vacancy, a civil war will likely happen. 

<!-- and though the former institution may, to a superficial view, appear the most advantageous; yet a more accurate inspection will discover in it greater  than in the latter, and such as are founded on causes and principles eternal and immutable.  -->

<!--   filling of the throne, in such a government, is a point of too great and too general interest, not : 

Whence a , the greatest of ills, may be apprehended, almost with certainty, .  -->

The prince elected must be either:

> a Foreigner

He:
- is ignorant of the people he is to govern
- is suspicious of his new subjects and suspected by them
- prefers foreigners. These only care about enriching themselves in the quickest manner, while their masterâ€™s favour and authority are able to support them. 

> a Native

He:
- will carry his old private animosities and friendships with him. 
- will excite the envy of those who formerly considered him as their equal

A crown is too much of a reward to be given to merit alone. It will always induce the candidates to employ force, money, or intrigue, to procure the votes of the electors. In this way, the election will just be the same as when the position was hereditary.

<!-- give no better chance for superior merit in the prince, than if the state had trusted to birth alone for determining their sovereign. -->

It may therefore be pronounced as an universal axiom in politics, That an hereditary prince, a nobility without vassals, and a people voting by their representatives, form the best monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. 

<!-- But in order to prove more fully, that politics admit of general truths, which are invariable by the humour or education either of subject or sovereign, it may not be amiss to observe some other principles of this science, which may seem to deserve that character. -->

**Maxim: Free governments are commonly the most happy for those who have freedom. But they are the most ruinous and oppressive to their provinces.** 

When a monarch conquers new lands, he soon learns to treat his old and his new subjects as equals. He makes the general laws apply to them equally.

<!-- because, in reality, all his subjects are to him the same, except the few friends and favourites, with whom he is personally acquainted.  -->
<!-- He does not, therefore, make any distinction between them in his .
He is careful to prevent all particular acts of oppression on the one as well as on the other.  -->

But a free state necessarily makes a great distinction until the citizens learn to love their neighbours as themselves. 

In such a government, the conquerors are also lawmakers. They will contrive matters as to draw some private and public advantage from their conquests:
- by restrictions on trade, and 
- by taxes

Provincial governors have also a better chance, in a republic, to escape with their plunder, by means of bribery or intrigue; and their fellow-citizens, who find their own state to be enriched by the spoils of the subject provinces, will be the more inclined to tolerate such abuses. 

A free state changes its governors frequently as a precaution. This obliges these temporary tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious so that they may accumulate wealth before they are replaced. <!--  give place to their successors. What cruel tyrants were the Romans over the world during the time of their commonwealth!  -->

The Romans had laws to prevent the oppression by their provincial governors. But Cicero tells us that the Romans repealed these very laws for the sake of those provinces. 
- When the laws were in place, the tyrants would plunder to satisfy themselves, as well as the judges and the great men in Rome who protected those governors. 
- Without those laws, those governors would plunder only for themselves

<!-- Who can read of the cruelties and oppressions of Verres without horror and astonishment?  -->

![Cicero giving a speech](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/medieval/cicero.jpg)

Cicero had exhausted all the thunders of his eloquence against Gaius Verres, a corrupt governor, in order to have him exiled. Yet that cruel tyrant lived to old age, in opulence and ease. Thirty years later, he was put into the proscription by Mark Anthony because of his exorbitant wealth. <!-- , where he fell with Cicero himself, and all the most virtuous men of Rome? --> 

Tacitus tells us that after the republic's dissolution, the Roman yoke became easier on the provinces. Many of the worst emperors, such as Domitian, were careful to prevent all oppression on the provinces. 

<!-- In Tiberiusâ€™s time, Gaul was esteemed richer than Italy itself. 
Nor, do I find, during the whole time of the Roman monarchy, that the empire became less rich or populous in any of its provinces; though indeed its valour and military discipline were always upon the [21] decline.  -->

Polybius tells us that the oppression and tyranny of the Carthaginians over their subject states in Africa was so severe. They were not content with exacting half of all the produce of the land<!-- , which of itself was a very high rent -->, but also loaded them with many other taxes. 

This is true even in modern times. **The provinces of absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of free states.** 

This is seen in:
- the difference between the PaÃ¯s conquis of France and Ireland. 
- the Persians, under the Greeks of Alexander, not making the smallest effort to recover their former independence, as observed by Machiaveli. 
<!-- , and you will be convinced of this truth; though this latter kingdom, being, in a good measure, peopled from England, possesses so many rights and privileges as should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a conquered province. Corsica is also an obvious instance to the same purpose. -->

<!-- | There is an observation in Machiavel, with regard to the conquests of Alexander the Great, which I think, may be regarded as one of those eternal political truths, which no time nor accidents can vary.  -->

<!-- says that it is strange that such sudden conquests, as those , should be possessed so peaceably by his successors, and that the Persians, during all the confusions and civil wars among the Greeks, never made the .  -->

According to Machiaveli, the cause is that a monarch may govern his subjects in two ways:

> 1. He may rule absolutely, like the eastern princes

He can stretch his authority so far as to leave no distinction of rank among his subjects. There are:
- no advantages of birth, 
- no hereditary honours and possessions and
- no credit among the people, except from his commission alone. 

After a conquest, it is impossible ever to shake off the yoke since no one has so much personal credit and authority to lead the people.


> 2. He may exert his power more mildly, like other European princes

He can leave other sources of honour: Birth, titles, possessions, valour, integrity, knowledge, or great achievements. 

The least discord among the conquerors will encourage the people to rebel since they already have leaders ready to guide them.

This seems solid and conclusive. Machiaveli, however, added a fallacy that monarchies following the eastern policy are the most difficult to subdue, though are more easily kept when once subdued. This cannot happen because:
- a tyrannical government weakens the courage of men and makes them indifferent on the fortunes of their sovereign
- the temporary and delegated authority of their generals and magistrates are also absolute which then leads to the most dangerous and fatal revolutions
<!-- ; since they cannot contain any powerful subject, whose discontent and faction may facilitate the enterprizes of an enemy.  -->

<!-- ; being always, in such governments, as absolute within its sphere, as that of the prince himself; is able, with barbarians, accustomed to a blind submission, to produce . 
 -->

This is why a gentle government is preferable, and gives the greatest security to the sovereign and his subjects.

Legislators, therefore, should not trust the future government of a state entirely to chance. They should provide a system of laws to regulate the administration of public affairs to posterity. 

<!-- Effects will always correspond to causes; and wise regulations in any commonwealth are the most valuable legacy that can be left to future ages.  -->

In the smallest court or office, the stated forms and methods, by which business must be conducted, are a considerable check on mankind's natural depravity. 

The same can be done for the public affairs. The stability and wisdom of the Venetian government is due to its form of government.

It is easy to point out the defects in the original constitutions of Athens and Rome which produced their tumultuous governments and led to their ruin. 

The rise and fall of governments depend so little on the humours and education of particular men. One part of the same republic may be governed well, while another is unstable, by the very same men because of the differences in the institutions of those parts.<!--   the forms and , by which these parts are regulated.  -->

This was actually the case with Genoa. It was always full of sedition,  tumult, and disorder, while the bank of St. George, a big part of the state, was conducted with the utmost integrity and wisdom for several ages.
<!-- , which had become a considerable part of the people,  -->

The ages of greatest public spirit are not always most eminent for private virtue. Good laws may beget order and moderation in the government while the people's manners and customs have little humanity or justice. 

The best political periods of Roman history was that between the beginning of the first Punic war, and the end of the last Punic war. Back then, the balance between the nobility and the people were fixed by the contests of the tribunes and not by the extent of conquests. 

It was then that the horrid practice of poisoning was so common.<!--  , that, during part of a season, --> A Praetor gave capital punishment to over 3,000 persons in a part of Italy for this crime.

<!--  and found informations of this nature still multiplying upon him. There is a similar, or rather [26] a worse instance,17 in the more early times of the commonwealth. So depraved in private life were that people, whom in their histories we so much admire. --> 

They were really more virtuous during the time of the two Triumvirates when they were:
- tearing their common country to pieces, and
- spreading slaughter and desolation merely for the choice of tyrants.

<!-- Here, then, is a sufficient inducement to maintain, with the utmost Zeal,  -->

In every free state, we should maintain with utmost zeal those institutions which:
- secure liberty
- consult the public good, and 
- restrain and punish the avarice or ambition of particular men. 

<!-- Nothing does more honour to human nature, than to see it susceptible of so noble a passion; as nothing can be a greater indication of meanness of heart in any man, than to see him destitute of it. 

A man who loves only himself, without regard to friendship and desert, merits the severest blame. 
A man, who is only susceptible of friendship, without public spirit, or a regard to the community, is deficient in the most material part of virtue.

But this is a subject which needs not be longer insisted on at present. There are enowÂ° of 
 -->

Zealots on both sides who kindle up the passions of their partizans. Under pretence of public good, they pursue the interests and ends of their particular faction. 

I always promote moderation than zeal. The surest way of producing moderation in every party is to increase our zeal for the public. 

Let us try to be moderate with regard to the parties that currently divide our country. At the same time, we should not let this moderation reduce our industry and passion for the good of the country.

Those who either attack or defend a minister in our free government always
- carry matters to an extreme, and
- exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the public. 

His enemies charge him with the greatest crimes, both in domestic and foreign management:
- unnecessary wars, 
- scandalous treaties, 
- profusion of public treasure, 
- oppressive taxes, 
- every kind of mal-administration

To aggravate the charge, they say that his pernicious conduct will extend its baleful influence even to posterity by:
- undermining the best constitution in the world, and
- disordering that wise system of laws, institutions, and customs which have happily governed our ancestors so many centuries. 

<!-- He is not only a wicked minister in himself, but has removed every security provided against wicked ministers for the future. -->

On the other hand, the minister's partizans make his panegyric run as high as those accusations. They celebrate his wise, steady, and moderate conduct of his administration:
- the nation's honour and interest abroad, 
- the public credit maintained at home, 
- the persecutions restrained and faction subdued.

The merit of all these blessings is ascribed solely to the minister. At the same time, he crowns all his other merits by a religious care of the best constitution in the world, which he has preserved and transmitted entire to the future generations.

The attack and defense from the partizans of each party:
- beget an extraordinary ferment on both sides, and
- fill the nation with violent animosities. 

Both the attackers and defeners fail the see their contradictions. 
<!-- But I would fainÂ° persuade these party-zealots, that there is a flat contradiction both in the accusation and panegyric, and that it were impossible for either of them to run so high, were it not for this contradiction.  -->

To the attackers:

If our constitution were really that excellent, then it would never have created a wicked and weak minister to govern triumphantly for 20 years when opposed by the greatest geniuses in the nation who used the freedom of expression in parliament and in public. If the minister is wicked and weak, then it means that the constitution is faulty in its original principles. A good constitution should have provided a remedy against mal-administration. 

<!-- noble fabric, the pride of Britain, the envy of our neighbours, raised by the labour of so many centuries, repaired at the expence of so many millions, and cemented by such a profusion of blood; if our constitution does in any degree deserve [29] these eulogies,h  -->

<!-- He cannot consistently be charged with undermining the best form of government in the world. 
; and if the British, when in its greatest vigour, and repaired by two such remarkable events, as the Revolution and Accession, by which our ancient royal family was sacrificed to it;22 if our constitution, I say, with so great advantages, [30] does not, in fact, provide any such remedy, we are rather beholden to any minister who undermines it, and affords us an opportunity of erecting a better in its place. -->

<!-- I would employ the same topics to moderate the zeal of those who defend the minister.  -->

To the defenders:

If our constitution is so excellent then a change of ministry cannot be a dreadful event since it is essential to our constitution. <!--  in every ministry, both to preserve itself from violation, and to prevent all enormities in the administration. --> 

If our constitution is very bad then such a jealousy and apprehension on the changes is ill-placed. We should expect changes in ministers just as a husband who had married a woman from a bar should expect her infidelity. Public affairs, in such a government, must necessarily go to confusion anyway. The zeal of patriots is in that case is less needed than the patience and submission of philosophers.  The virtue and good intentions of Cato and Brutus are highly laudable. But, to what purpose did their zeal serve? They only hastened the decline of the Roman government and rendered its convulsions and dying agonies more violent and painful. In such a case, the claims of moderate men should be examined or admitted. 

<!-- I would not be understood to mean, that public affairs deserve no care and attention at all. Would men be moderate and consistent, their claims might be admitted; at least .  -->

The country-party might still assert, that our constitution still allows mal-administration even if it is excellent. Therefore, if the minister is bad, it is proper to oppose him with some zeal. 

On the other hand, the court-party may be allowed to defend the minister, with some zeal too, if he were good. 

In this case, the people should not <!--  would only persuade men not to contend, as if they were fighting pro aris & focis, and --> change a good constitution into a bad one, by the violence of their factions.

The best civil constitution is one that restrains every man by the most rigid laws. In it, it is easy to discover the intentions of a minister, and to judge, whether his personal character deserve love or hatred. 

<!-- But such questions are of little importance to the public, and lay those, who employ their pens upon them, under a just suspicion either of malevolence or of flattery. -->
