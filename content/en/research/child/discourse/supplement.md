Supplement
The foregoing discourse I wrote in the sickness-summer at my country
habitation, not then intending to publish it, but only to communicate it
to some honourable and ingenious friends of the present parliament,
who were pleased to take copies of it for their own deliberate considera-
tion, and digestion of the principles therein asserted; which at ﬁrst were
strange to them, as I expect they will be to most others, till they have
spent some time in thinking on them; after which, I doubt not but that
all men will be convinced of the truth of them, that have not some private
interest of their own against them, external to the general good of the
kingdom. For sure I am they have a foundation in nature, and that ac-
cording to the excellent Sir William Petty’s observation in his last dis-
course, concerning taxes, “res nolent male administrare:” nature must
and will have its course, the matter in England is prepared for an abate-
ment of interest, and it cannot long be obstructed; and after the next
abatement, whoever lives forty years longer, shall see a second abate-
ment; for we shall never stand on even ground in trade with the Dutch,
till interest be the same with us as it is with them.
His majesty was graciously pleased at the opening of the last session
of this parliament, to propose to the consideration of both houses, the
ballancing of the trade of the nation; to eﬀect which, in my opinion, the
abatement of interest is the ﬁrst and principal engine which ought to be
set on work, which notwithstanding, I should not have presumed to ex-
pose to public censure, on my own single opinion, if I had not had the
concurrences of much better judgments than my own; having never seen
any thing in print for it, though much against it, until the latter end of
January last; at which time, a friend whom I had often discoursed with
upon this subject, met with by accident a small tract to the same purpose,
 
wrote near ﬁfty years ago, which he gave me, and I have, for the public
good, thought ﬁt to annex it hereunto verbatim.
The author of the said tract, by its stile, seems to have been a country
gentleman, and my education has mostly been that of a merchant, so I
hope, that going together, they may in some measure, supply the defect
of each other.
Another reason that induced me to the printing of them together, is,
because what he wrote then, would be the consequence of the abatement
of interest from  to  per cent. I have, I think, fully proved to the con-
viction of all men not wilfully blind, they have been the real eﬀects of it,
and that to a greater proportion than he did promise; every paragraph of
which is written by me, and copies of it delivered to several worthy mem-
bers of this parliament, many months before ever I saw or heard of this,
or any thing else written or printed to the like purpose.
What I have aimed at in the whole, is the good of my native country,
otherwise I had not busied my self about it; for I want not employment
suﬃcient of my own, nor have reason to be out of love with that I have.
The several particulars in the beginning of this treatise, relating to
trade, I have only hinted in general terms; hoping that some abler pen
will hereafter be incited for the service of his king and country, to enlarge
more particularly upon them.
Before I conclude, though I have studied brevity in the whole, I can-
not omit the inserting of one objection more, which I have lately met
with, to the main design of this treatise, viz.
Object. It is said that the lowness of interest of money in Holland, is
not the eﬀect of the laws, but proceeds only from their abundance of
coin; for that in Holland, there is no law limiting the rate of usury.
Answ. I answer, that it may be true, that in Holland there has not lately
been any law, to limit usury to the present rate it is now at, i.e.  or  per
cent. Altho’ most certain it is, that many years since, there was a law that
did limit it to  or  at most: and by consequence, there would be a re-
newing of that law to a lesser rate, were it necessary at this time; it hav-
ing always been the policy of that people to keep down the interest of
their money,  or  per cent. under the rate of what is usually paid in their
neighbouring countries, which, being now naturally done, it is needless
to use the artiﬁcial stratagem of a law to establish.A New Discourse

Answ. . Although they have no law expresly limiting interest at pres-
ent, yet they have other laws which we cannot yet arrive to, and those do
eﬀect the same thing among them, and would do the like among us, if
we could have them: one of which, is their ascertaining real securities by
their public registers: for we see evidently, money is not so much want-
ing in England as securities, which men account infallible; a remarkable
instance of which is, the east-India company, who can and do take up
what money they please, for  per cent. at any time.
Another law is, their constitutions of Banks and Lumbards, whereby
private persons that have but tolerable credit may be supplied at easy
rates from the state.

A third, and very considerable one, is, their law for transferring bills
of debt, mentioned in the beginning of this discourse.
A fourth, which is a custom, and in eﬀect may be here to our purpose
accounted as a law, is the extraordinary frugality used in all their public
aﬀairs, which in their greatest extremities have been such, as not to com-
pel them to give above four per cent for the loan of money. Whereas it is
said, his majesty in some cases of exigency, when the national supplies
have not come in to answer the present emergencies of aﬀairs, has been
enforced to give above the usual rates to goldsmiths; and that encouraged
them to take up great sums from private persons at the full rate of  per
cent. whereas formerly they usually gave but  per cent. 

Otherwise, in human probability money would have fallen of itself to  per cent.
But again, to conclude, every nation does proceed according to the pe-
culiar methods of their own in the transactions of their public aﬀairs and
law-making: 

In Britain, it has always been the custom to reduce the rate of interest by a law, when nature had prepared the matter
ﬁt for such an alteration, as now I say it has. By a law it was reduced from
an unlimited rate, to ; and afterwards from  to ; and after that from
 to . And through the blessing of almighty God, this kingdom has
found, as I think I have fully proved, and every man’s experience will
witness, prodigious success and advantage thereby. And I doubt not,
through the like blessing of God almighty, but this generation will ﬁnd
the like great and good eﬀects, by the reduction of it from  to , which
is now at the birth. And that the next generation will yet see far greater
advantages by bringing it from  to  per cent.
