The theory of moving tubes of force has been extensively developed by Sir Joseph Thomson.[38] 

Faraday introduced 2 kinds of tubes:

1. Magnetic
2. Electric

These were also used by Poynting.

Thomson resolved to discard the magentic and employ only the electric. This was a distinct departure from Faraday's conceptions which put great significance to the physical reality of the magnetic lines.

Thomson justified his choice by inferences drawn from the phenomena of electric conduction in liquids and gases.

These phenomena indicate that molecular structure is closely connected with tubes of electrostatic force—perhaps much more closely than with tubes of magnetic force; and Thomson therefore decided to regard magnetism as the secondary effect, and to ascribe magnetic fields, not to the presence of magnetic tubes, but to the motion of electric tubes. 

In order to account for magnetic fields occuring without any electric force, he assumed that tubes exist in great numbers everywhere in space, either in the form of closed circuits or else terminating on atoms, and that electric force is only perceived when the tubes have a greater tendency to lie in one direction than in another. 

In a steady magnetic field the positive and negative tubes might be conceived to be moving in opposite directions with equal velocities.

A beam of light might, from this point of view, be regarded simply as a group of tubes of force which are moving with the velocity of light at right angles to their own length. 

Such a conception almost amounts to a return to the corpuscular theory; but since the tubes have definite directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation, there would now be no difficulty in explaining polarization.

The energy accompanying all electric and magnetic phenomena was supposed by Thomson to be ultimately kinetic energy of the aether; the electric part of it being represented by rotation of the aether inside and about the tubes, and the magnetic part being the energy of the additional disturbance set up in the aether by the movement of the tubes. The inertia of this latter motion he regarded as the cause of induced electromotive force.

There was, however, one phenomenon of the electromagnetic field as yet unexplained in terms of these conceptions—namely, the ponderomotive force which is exerted by the field on a conductor carrying an electric current. Now any ponderomotive force consists in a transfer of mechanical momentum from the agent which exerts the force to the body which experiences it; and it occurred to Thomson that the ponderomotive forces of the electromagnetic field might be explained if the moving tubes of force, which enter a conductor carrying a clurent and are there dissolved, were supposed to possess mechanical momentum, which could be yielded up to the conductor. It is readily seen that such momentum must be directed at right angles to the tube and to the magnetic induction—a result which suggests that the momentum stored in unit volume of the aether may be proportional to the vector-product of the electric and magnetic vectors.

For this conjecture reasons of a more definite kind may be given.[39] We have already seen[40] that the ponderomotive forces on material bodies in the electromagnetic field may be accounted for by Maxwell's supposition that across any plane in the aether whose unit normal is N, there is a stress represented by

So long as the field is steady (i.e. electrostatic or magnetostatic) the resultant of the stresses acting on any element of volume of the aether is zero, so that the element is in equilibrium. But when the field is variable, this is no longer the case. The resultant stress on the aether contained within a surface S is

integrated over the surface: transforming this into a volume- integral, the term (D.N)E gives a term div D.E + (D.∇)E, where ∇ denotes the vector operator (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z); and the first of these terms vanishes, since D is a circuital vector; the term - 

(D.E)N gives in the volume-integral a term 

grad (D.E); and the magnetic terms give similar results. So the resultant force on unit-volume of the aether is

which may be written

or, by virtue of the fundamental equations for dielectrics,

This result compels us to adopt one of three alternatives: either to modify the theory so as to reduce to zero the resultant force on an element of free aether; this expedient has not met with general favour;[41] or to assume that the force in question sets the aether in motion: this alternative was chosen by Helmholtz,[42] but is inconsistent with the theory of the aether which was generally received in the closing years of the century; or lastly, with Thomson,[43] to accept the principle that the aether is itself the vehicle of mechanical momentum, of amount [D.B] per unit volume.

Maxwell's theory was now being developed in ways which could scarcely have been anticipated by its author. But although every year added something to the superstructure, the foundations remained much as Maxwell had laid them, the doubtful argument by which he had sought to justify the introduction of displacement-currents was still all that was offered in their defence. In 1884, however, the theory was established[44] on a different basis by a pupil of Helmholtz', Heinrich Hertz (b. 1857, d. 1894).

The train of Hertz' ideas resembles that by which Ampère, on hearing of Oersted's discovery of the magnetic field produced by electric currents, inferred that electric currents should exert ponderomotive forces on each other. Ampère argued that a current, being competent to originate a magnetic field, must be equivalent to a magnet in other respects; and therefore that currents, like magnets, should exhibit forces of mutual attraction and repulsion.

Ampère's reasoning rests on the assumption that the magnetic field produced by a current is in all respects of the same nature as that produced by a magnet; in other words, that only one kind of magnetic force exists. This principle of the "unity of magnetic force" Hertz now proposed to supplement by asserting that the electric force generated by a changing magnetic field is identical in nature with the electric force due to electrostatic charges; this second principle he called the "unity of electric force." 

Suppose, then, that a system of electric currents ι exists in otherwise empty space. According to the older theory, these currents give rise to a vector-potential a1, equal to Pot ι;[45] and the magnetic force H1, is the curl of a1: while the electric force E1, at any point in the field, produced by the variation of the currents, is 


It is now assumed that the electric force so produced is indistinguishable from the electric force which would be set up by electrostatic charges, and therefore that the system of varying currents exerts ponderomotive forces on electrostatic charges; the principle of action and reaction then requires that electrostatic charges should exert ponderomotive forces on a system of varying currents, and consequently (again appealing to the principle of the unity of electric force) that two systems of varying currents should exert on each other ponderomotive forces due to the variations.

But just as Helmholtz,[46] by aid of the principle of conservation of energy, deduced the existence of an electromotive force of induction from the existence of the ponderomotive forces between electric currents (i.e. variable electric systems), so from the existence of ponderomotive forces between variable systems of currents (i.e. variable magnetic systems) we may infer that variations in the rate of change of a variable magnetic system give rise to induced magnetic forces in the surrounding space. The analytical formulae which determine these forces will be of the same kind as in the electric case; so that the induced magnetic force H′ is given by an equation of the form

where e denotes some constant, and b1, which is analogous to the vector-potential in the electric case, is a circuital vector whose curl is the electric force E1, of the variable magnetic system. The value of b1, is therefore 


: so we have
.

This must be added to H1. Writing H2, for the sum, H + H′, we see that H2 is the curl of a2, where


and the electric force E2, will then be 

. This system is not, however, final; for we must now perform the process again with these improved values of the electric and magnetic forces and the vector-potential; and so we obtain for the magnetic force the value curl a3, and for the electric force the value 

This process must again be repeated indefinitely; so finally we obtain for the magnetic force H the value curl a, and for the electric force E the value 


where


It is evident that the quantity a thus defined satisfies the equation


This equation may be written


while the equations H = curl a}, 


These are, however, the fundamental equations of Maxwell's theory in the form given in his memoir of 1868.[47]
