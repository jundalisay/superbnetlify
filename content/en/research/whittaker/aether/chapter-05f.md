A further objection to Cauchy's theories is that the relations between the constants do not appear to admit of any simple physical interpretation, being evidently assumed for the sole purpose of forcing the formulae into some degree of conformity with the results of experiment. 

Further difficulties will appear when we proceed subsequently to compare the properties which are assigned to the aether in crystal-optics with those which must be postulated in order to account for reflexion and refraction.

To the latter problem Cauchy soon addressed himself, his investigations being in fact published[18] in the same year (1830) as the first of his theories of crystal-optics.

At the outset of any work on refraction, it is necessary to assign a cause for the existence of refractive indices, i.e. for the variation in the velocity of light from one body to another. Huygens, as we have seen, suggested that transparent bodies consist of hard particles which interact with the aethereal matter, modifying its elasticity. Cauchy in his earlier papers[19] followed this lead more or less closely, assuming that the density ρ of the aether is the same in all media, but that its rigidity n varies from one medium to another.

Let the axis of x be taken at right angles to the surface of separation of the media, and the axis of z parallel to the intersection of this interface with the incident wave-front; and suppose, first, that the incident vibration is executed at right angles to the plane of incidence, so that it may be represented by


where i denotes the angle of incidence; the reflected wave may be represented by


and the refracted wave by


where r denotes the angle of refraction, and n′ the rigidity of the second medium.

To obtain the conditions satisfied at the reflecting surface, Cauchy assumed (without assigning reasons) that the x- and y-components of the stress across the xy-plane are equal in the media on either side the interface. This implies in the present case that the quantities

are to be continuous across the interface: so we have

Eliminating f′1, we have

Now this is Fresnel's sine-law for the ratio of the intensity of the reflected ray to that of the incident ray; and it is known that the light to which it applies is that which is polarized parallel to the plane of incidence. Thus Cauchy was driven to the conclusion that, in order to satisfy the known facts of reflexion and refraction, the vibrations of the aether must be supposed executed at right angles the plane of polarization of the light.



The case of a vibration performed in the plane of incidence he discussed in the same way. It was found that Fresnel's tangent-law could be obtained by assuming that ex and the normal pressure across the interface have equal values in the two contiguous media.

The theory thus advanced was encumbered with many difficulties. In the first place, the identification of the plane of polarization with the plane at right angles to the direction of vibration was contrary to the only theory of crystal-optics which Cauchy had as yet published. In the second place, no reasons were given for the choice of the conditions at the interface. 

Cauchy's motive in selecting these particular conditions was evidently to secure the fulfilment of Fresnel's sine-law and tangent-law; but the results are inconsistent with the true boundary-conditions, which were given later by Green.

It is probable that the results of the theory of reflexion had much to do with the decision, which Cauchy now made,[20] to reject the first theory of crystal-optics in favour of the second. 

After 1836 he consistently adhered to the view that the vibrations of the aether are performed at right angles to the plane of polarization. In that year he made another attempt to frame a satisfactory theory of reflexion,[21] based on the assumption just mentioned, and on the following boundary-conditions:—At the interface between two media curl e is to be continuous, and (taking the axis of x normal to the interface) 


is also to be continuous.

Again we find no very satisfactory reasons assigned for the choice of the boundary-conditions, and as the continuity of e itself across the interface is not included amongst the conditions chosen, they are obviously open to criticism.

But they lead to Fresnel's sine- and tangent-equations, which correctly express the actual behaviour of light.[22] 

Cauchy remarks that in order to justify them it is necessary to abandon the assumption of his earlier theory, that the density of the aether is the same in all material bodies.

Neither in this nor in Cauchy's earlier theory of reflexion is any trouble caused by the appearance of longitudinal waves when a transverse wave is reflected, for the simple reason that he assumes the boundary-conditions to be only four in number; and these can all be satisfied without the necessity for introducing any but transverse vibrations.

These features bring out the weakness of Cauchy's method of attacking the problem. His object was to derive the properties of light from a theory of the vibrations of elastic solids. At the outset he had already in his possession the differential equations of motion of the solid, which were to be his starting-point, and the equations of Fresnel, which were to be his goal. 

It only remained to supply the boundary-conditions at an interface, which are required in the discussion of reflexion, and the relations between the elastic constants of the solid, which are required in the optics of crystals. Cauchy seems to have considered the question from the purely analytical point of view. 

Given certain differential equations, what supplementary conditions must be adjoined to them in order to produce a given analytical result? The problem when stated in this form admits of more than one solution, and hence it is not surprising that within the space of 10 years the great French mathematician produced two distinct theories of crystal-optics and three distinct theories of reflexion,[23] almost all yielding correct or nearly correct final formulae, and yet mostly irreconcilable with each other, and involving incorrect boundary-conditions and improbable relations between elastic constants.

Cauchy's theories, then, resemble Fresnel's in postulating types of elastic solid which do not exist, and for whose assumed properties no dynamical justification is offered.

The same objection applies, though in a less degree, to the original form of a theory of reflexion and refraction which was discovered about this time[24] almost simultaneously by James MacCullagh (b. 1809, d. 1847), of Trinity College, Dublin, and Franz Neumann (b. 1799, d. 1895), of Königsberg.

To these authors is due the merit of having extended the laws of reflexion to crystalline media; but the principles of the theory were originally derived in connexion with the simpler case of isotropic media, to which our attention will for the present be confined.

MacCullagh and Neumann felt that the great objection to Fresnel's theory of reflexion was its failure to provide for the continuity of the normal component of displacement at the interface between two media; it is obvious that a discontinuity in this component could not exist in any true elastic-solid theory, since it would imply that the two media do not remain in contact. 

Accordingly, they made it a fundamental condition that all three components of the displacement must be continuous at the interface, and found that the sine-law and tangent-law can be reconciled with this condition only by supposing that the aether-vibrations are parallel to the plane of polarization: which supposition they accordingly adopted. 

In place of the remaining three true boundary-conditions, however, they used only a single equation, derived by assuming that transverse incident waves give rise only to transverse reflected and refracted waves, and that the conservation of energy holds for these—i.e. that the masses of aether put in motion, multiplied by the squares of the amplitudes of vibration, are the same before and after incidence. This is, of course, the same device as had been used previously by Fresnel; it must, however, be remarked that the principle is unsound as applied to an ordinary elastic solid; for in such a body the refracted and reflected energy would in part be carried away by longitudinal waves.

In order to obtain the sine and tangent laws, MacCullagh and Neumann found it necessary to assume that the inertia of the luminiferous medium is everywhere the same, and that the differences in behaviour of this medium in different substances are due to differences in its elasticity. The two laws may then be deduced in much the same way as in the previous investigations of Fresnel and Cauchy.

Although to insist on continuity of displacement at the interface was a decided advance, the theory of MacCullagh and Neumann scarcely showed as yet much superiority over the quasi-mechanical theories of their predecessors. 

MacCullagh himself expressly disavowed any claim to regard his theory, in the form to which it had then been brought, as a final explanation of the properties of light. "If we are asked," he wrote, "what reasons can be assigned for the hypotheses on which the preceding theory is founded, we are far from being able to give a satisfactory answer. We are obliged to confess that, with the exception of the law of vis viva, the hypotheses are nothing more than fortunate conjectures.

These conjectures are very probably right, since they have led to elegant laws which are fully borne out by experiments; but this is all we can assert respecting them. We cannot attempt to deduce them from first principles; because, in the theory of light, such principles are still to be sought for. It is certain, indeed, that light is produced by undulations, propagated, with transversal vibrations, through a highly elastic aether; but the constitution of this aether, and the laws of its connexion (if it has any connexion) with the particles of bodies, are utterly unknown."

The needful reformation of the elastic-solid theory of reflexion was effected by Green, in a paper[25] read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in December, 1837. Green, though inferior to Cauchy as an analyst, was his superior in physical insight; instead of designing boundary-equations for the express purpose of yielding Fresnel's sine and tangent formulae, he set to work to determine the conditions which are actually satisfied at the interfaces of real elastic solids, These he obtained by means of general dynamical principles. In an isotropic medium which is strained, the potential energy per unit volume due to the state of stress is

(where ρ denotes the density), the equation of motion may be deduced.

But this method does more than merely furnish the equation of motion

or,


which had already been obtained by Cauchy; for it also yields the boundary-conditions which must be satisfied at the interface between two elastic media in contact; these are, as might be guessed by physical intuition, that the three components of the displacement[26] and the three components of stress across the interface are to be equal in the two media. 

If the axis of x be taken normal to the interface, the latter 3 quantities are
