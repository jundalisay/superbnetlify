The doctrines peculiar to Maxwell are the existence of:
- displacement-currents, and
- electromagnetic vibrations identical with light

These were not introduced in Volume 1 or Volume 2 first half. The account given of them was scarcely more complete, and was perhaps less attractive, than that which had been furnished in the original memoirs.

Some matters were, however, discussed more fully in the Treatise than in Maxwell's previous writings, and among these was the question of stress in the electromagnetic field.

Faraday [62], when studying the curvature of lines of force in electrostatic fields, had noticed an apparent tendency of adjacent lines to repel each other, as if each tube of force were inherently disposed to distend laterally.

In addition to this repellent or diverging force in the transverse direction, he supposed an attractive or contractile force to be exerted at right angles to it, that is to say, in the direction of the lines of force.

Of the existence of these pressures and tensions Maxwell was fully persuaded; and he determined analytical expressions suitable to represent them. The tension along the lines of force must be supposed to maintain the ponderomotive force which acts on the conductor on which the lines of force terminate; and it may therefore be measured by the force which is exerted on unit area of the conductor, i.e., εE2/8πc2 or  DE. 

The pressure at right angles to the lines of force must then be determined so as to satisfy the condition that the aether is to be in equilibrium.

Consider a thin shell of aether included between two equipotential surfaces. 

The equilibrium of the portion of this shell which is intercepted by a tube of force: requires (as in the theory of the equilibrium of liquid films), that the resultant force per unit area due to the abovementioned normal tensions on its two faces shall have the value T(1/ρ1 + 1/ρ2), where ρ1 and ρ2 denote the principal radii of curvature of the shell at the place, and where T denotes. the lateral stress across unit length of the surface of the shell, I being analogous to the surface-tension of a liquid film.

Now, if t denote the thickness of the shell, the area intercepted on the second face by the tube of force bears to the area intercepted on the first face the ratio (ρ1 + t) (ρ2 + t)/ρ1ρ2; and by the fundamental property of tubes of force, D and E vary inversely as the cross-section of the tube, so the total force on the second face will bear to that on the first face the ratio

ρ1ρ2/(ρ1 + t) (ρ2 + t),

or approximately

(1 - t/ρ1 - tρ2);

the resultant force per unit area along the outward normal is
therefore


and so we have



or the pressure at right angles to the lines of force is 
1
2
DE per unit area—that is, it is numerically equal to the tension along the lines of force.

The principal stresses in the medium being thus determined, it readily follows that the stress across any plane, to which the unit vector N is normal, is



Maxwell obtained[63] a similar formula for the case of magnetic fields; the pouderomotive forces on magnetized matter and on conductors carrying currents may be accounted for by assuming a stress in the medium, the stress across the plane N being represented by the vector



This, like the corresponding electrostatic formula, represents a tension across planes perpendicular to the lines of force, and a pressure across planes parallel to them.

Maxwell made no distinction between stress in the material dielectric and stress in the aether. As long as material bodies when displaced carry the contained aether along with them, then no distinction was possible.

Maxwell's theory was modified many years afterwards by his followers. Stresses corresponding to those introduced by Maxwell were assigned to the aether, as distinct from ponderable matter. It was assumed that the only stresses set up in material bodies by the electromagnetic field are produced indirectly. 

They may be calculated by the methods of the theory of elasticity, from & knowledge of the ponderomotive forces exerted on the electric charges connected with the bodies.

Maxwell's theory considered the question of stress in the medium from the purely statical point of view. 

He determined the stress so that it might produce the required forces on ponderable bodies, and be self-equilibrating in free aether. 

But[64] if the electric and magnetic phenomena are really kinetic in their nature and not static, then the stress or pressure need not be self-equilibrating.

This is illustrated by reference to the hydrodynamical models of the aether in which perforated solids are immersed in a moving liquid.

The ponderomotive forces exerted on the solids by the liquid correspond to those which act on conductors carrying currents in a magnetic field, and yet there is no stress in the medium beyond the pressure of the liquid.

Among the problems to which Maxwell applied his theory of stress in the medium was one which had engaged the attention of many generations of his predecessors. 

The adherents of the corpuscular theory of light in the 18th century believed that their hypothesis would be decisively confirmed if it could be shown that rays of light possess momentum.

Several investigators directed powerful beams of light on delicately-suspended bodies. They looked for evidence of a pressure from the impulse of the corpuscles.

In 1708, Homberg did this experiment and [65] imagined that he actually achieved this. 

But Mairan and Du Fay repeated his operations and failed to confirm his conclusion.[66]

The subject was afterwards taken up by Michell. Priestley[67] in 1772 wrote that Michell tried "to ascertain the momentum of light much more accurately than how M. Homberg and M. Mairan had done." 

He exposed a very thin and delicately-suspended copper plate to the sun concentrated by a mirror, and observed a deflexion. 

He was not satisfied that the effect of the heating of the air had been altogether excluded, but Priestley think that "the motion above mentioned is from the impulse of the rays of light."

A similar experiment was made by A. Bennet[68]. He directed the light from the focus of a large lens on writing-paper delicately suspended in an exhausted receiver. But he "could not perceive any motion distinguishable from the effects of heat." 

"Perhaps," he concluded, " sensible heat and light may not be caused by the influx or rectilineal projections of fine particles, but by the vibrations made in the universally diffused caloric or matter of heat, or fluid of light." 

Thus Bennet, and after him Young,[69] regarded the non-appearance of light-repulsion in this experiment as an argument in favour of the undulatory system of light. 

Young writes: "For," wrote , "the corpuscles of light have the utmost imaginable subtility. Their effects might naturally be expected to bear some proportion to the effects of the much less rapid notions of the electrical fluid, which are so very easily perceptible, even in their weakest states."

<!-- This attitude is all the more remarkable, because  -->

Euler many years before had thought that light-pressure might be expected just as reasonably on the undulatory as on the corpuscular hypothesis. 

Euler writes: "Just as [70] a vehement sound excites a vibratory motion in the air and a real movement of the dust in it. The vibratory motion set up by the light causes a similar effect." 

Euler believed:
- in the existence of light-pressure and 
- that the tails of comets (adopting Kepler's suggestion) were caused by the solar rays impinging on the comet's atmosphere, driving off from it the more subtle of its particles.

Maxwell[71] examined this question from the point of view of the electromagnetic theory of light, which readily furnishes reasons for the existence of light-pressure. 

Light falling on a metallic reflecting surface at perpendicular incidence may be regarded as constituted of a rapidly-alternating magnetic field. This must induce electric currents in the surface layers of the metal.

But. a metal carrying currents in a magnetic field is acted on by a ponderomotive force, which is at right angles to both the magnetic force and the direction of the current. It is therefore, in the present case, normal to the reflecting surface. 

This ponderomotive force is the light-pressure. Thus, according to Maxwell's theory, light-pressure is only an extended case of effects which may readily be produced in the laboratory.

The magnitude of the light-pressure was deduced by Maxwell from his theory of stresses in the medium. We have seen that the stress across a plane whose unit-normal is N is represented by the vector


Suppose that a plane wave is incident perpendicularly on a perfectly reflecting metallic sheet: this sheet must support the mechanical stress which exists at its boundary in the aether. 

Owing to the presence of the reflected wave, D is zero at the surface; and B is perpendicular to N, so (B.N) vanishes. 

Thus the stress is a pressure of magnitude (1/8π) (B.H) normal to the surface: that is, the light-pressure is equal to the density of the aethereal energy in the region immediately outside the metal. This was Maxwell's result.

This conclusion has been reached on the assumption that the light is incident normally to the reflecting surface. If, on the other hand, the surface is placed in an enclosure completely surrounded by a radiating shell, so that radiation falls on it from all directions, it may be shown that the light-pressure is measured by one-third of the density of aethereal energy.
