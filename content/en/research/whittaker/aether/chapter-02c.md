The vicissitudes of the theory of heat is the most amazing in the history of natural philosophy. 

The true hypothesis, after having met with general acceptance throughout a century, and having been approved by a succession of illustrious men, was deliberately abandoned by their successors in favour of a conception utterly false, and, in some of its developments, grotesque and absurd.

s'Gravesande explained that in combustion, a heated body causes the light-corpuscles to interact with the material particles. Some constituents become separated and carried away with the corpuscles as flame and smoke. 

This view harmonizes with the theory of calcination which had been developed by Becher and his pupil Stahl at the end of the 17th century. It says that metals were composed of their calces and an element phlogiston. 

Combustion causes a metal to change into its calx. It was interpreted as a decomposition, in which the phlogiston separated from the metal and escaped into the atmosphere. The conversion of the calx into the metal was regarded as a union with phlogiston.[18]

s'Gravesande attributed electric effects to vibrations induced in effluvia, which he supposed to be permanently attached to such bodies as amber. 

He asserted: "Glass contains, and has on its surface, a certain atmosphere which is excited by friction and put into a vibratory motion; for it attracts and repels light Bodies.  The smallest parts of the glass are agitated by the Attrition, and by reason of their elasticity, their motion is vibratory, which is communicated to the Atmosphere above-mentioned: and therefore that Atmosphere exerts its action the further, the greater agitation the Parts of the Glass receive when a greater attrition is given to the glass."

The English translator of s'Gravesando's work played a considerable part in the history of electrical science. 

Jean Théophile Desaguliers (b. 1683, d. 1744) was an Englishman only by adoption. His father had been a Huguenot pastor who escaped France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He brought away the boy from La Rochelle concealed in a tub. 

The young Desaguliers was afterwards ordained, and became chaplain to that Duke of Chandos who was so ungratefully ridiculed by Lope. 

In this situation, he formed friendships with some of the natural philosophers of the capital such as Stephen Gray, an experimenter of whom little is known[19] beyond the fact that he was a pensioner of the Charterhouse.

In 1729, Gray communicated, as he says,[20] "to Dr. Desaguliers and some other Gentlemen” a discovery he had lately made, "showing that the Electrick Vertue of a Glass Tube may be conveyed to any other Bodies so as to give them the same Property of attracting and repelling light Bodies as the Tube does, when excited by rubbing. This attractive Vertue might be carried to Bodies that were many Feet distant from the Tube."

This was a result of the greatest importance, for previous workers had known of no other way of producing the attractive emanations than by rubbing the body concerned.[21] 

It was found that only a limited class of substances, among which the metals were conspicuous, had the capacity of acting as channels for the transport of the electric power; to these Desaguliers, who continued the experiments after Gray's death in 1736, gave[22] the name non-electrics or conductors.

After Gray's discovery, it was no longer possible to believe that the electric effluvia are inseparably connected with the bodies from which they are evoked by rubbing. 

It became necessary to admit that these emanations have an independent existence, and can be transferred from one body to another. 

Accordingly, we find them recognized, under the name of the electric fluid,[23] as one of the substances of which the world is constituted. The imponderability of this fluid did not, for the reasons already mentioned, prevent its admission by the side of light and caloric into the list of chemical elements.

The question was actively debated as to whether the electric fluid was an element sui generis, or, as some suspected, was another manifestation of that principle whose operation is seen in the phenomena of heat.

Those who held the latter view urged that the electric fluid and heat can both be induced by friction, can both induce combustion, and can both be transferred from one body to another by mere contact; and, moreover, that the best conductors of heat are also in general the best conductors of electricity.

On the other hand it was contended that, the electrification of a body does not cause any appreciable rise in its temperature; and an experiment of Stephen Gray's brought to light a yet more striking difference. Gray,[24] in 1729, made two oaken cubes, one solid and the other hollow, and showed that when electrified in the same way they produced exactly similar effects; whence he concluded that it was only the surfaces which had taken part in the phenomena. 

Thus while heat is disseminated throughout the substance of a body, the electric fluid resides at or near its surface. In the middle of the eighteenth century it was generally compared to an enveloping atmosphere. “The electricity which a non-electric of great length (for example, a hempen string 800 or 900 feet long) "receives, runs from one end to the other in a sphere of electrical Effluvia," says Desaguliers in 1740[25] and a report of the French Academy in 1733 says:[26] "Around an electrified body there is formed a vortex of exceedingly fine matter in a state of agitation, which urges towards the body such light substances as lie within its sphere of activity. The existence of this vortex is more than a mere conjecture; for when an electrified body is brought close to the face it causes a sensation like that of encountering a cobweb."[27]

The report from which this is quoted was prepared in connexion with the discoveries of Charles-François du Fay (b. 1698, d. 1739), superintendent of gardens to the King of France. Du Fay[28] accounted for the behaviour of gold leaf when brought near to an electrified glass tube by supposing that at first the vortex of the tube envelopes the gold-leaf, and so attracts it towards the tube. 

But when contact occurs, the gold-leaf acquires the electric virtue, and so becomes surrounded by a vortex of its own. The two vortices, striving to extend in contrary senses, repel each other, and the vortex of the tube, being the stronger, drives away that of the gold-leaf. 

“It is then certain," says du Fay,[29] "that bodies which have become electric by contact are repelled by those which have rendered them electric; but are they repelled likewise by other electrified bodies of all kinds? 

Do electrified bodies differ from each other in no respect save their intensity of electrification? An examination of this matter has led me to a discovery which I should never have foreseen, and of which I believe no one hitherto has had the least idea."

He found, in fact, that when gold-leaf which had been electrified by contact with excited glass was brought near to an excited piece of copal,[30] an attraction was manifested between them. 

"I had expected," he writes, "quite the opposite effect, since, according to my reasoning, the copal and gold-leaf, which both electrified, should have repelled each other." Proceeding with his experiments he found that the gold-leaf, when electrified and repelled by glass, was attracted by all electrified resinous substances, and that when repelled by the latter it was attracted by the glass.

“We see, then," he continues, "that there are two electricities of a totally different nature — namely, that of transparent solids, such as glass, crystal, &e., and that of bituminous or resinous bodies, such as amber, copal, sealing-wax, &e. 

Each of them repels bodies which have contracted an electricity of the same nature as its own, and attracts those whose electricity is of the contrary nature. We see even that bodies which are not themselves electrics can acquire either of these electricities, and that then their effects are similar to those of the bodies which have communicated it to them."

To the two kinds of electricity whose existence was thus demonstrated, du Fay gave the names vitreous and resinous, by which they have ever since been known.
