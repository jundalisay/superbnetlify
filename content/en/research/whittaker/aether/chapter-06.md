Towards the end of 1812, Davy received a letter in which the writer, a bookbinder's journeyman named Michael Faraday, expressed a desire to escape from trade, and obtain employment in a scientific laboratory. 

With the letter was enclosed a neatly written copy of notes which the young man—he was twenty-one years of age—had made of Davy's own public lectures. The great chemist replied courteously, and arranged an interview; at which he learnt that his correspondent had educated himself by reading the volumes which came into his hands for binding, "There were two," 

Faraday wrote later, "that especially helped me, the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica,' from which I gained my first notions of electricity, and Mrs. Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry, which gave me my foundation in that science." Already, before his application to Davy, he had performed a number of chemical experiments, and had made for himself a voltaic pile, with which he had decomposed several compound bodies.

At Davy's recommendation Faraday was in the following spring appointed to a post in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, which had been established at the close of the eighteenth century under the auspices of Count Rumford; and here he remained for the whole of his active life, first as assistant, then as director of the laboratory, and from 1833 onwards as the occupant of a chair of chemistry which was founded for his benefit.

For many years Faraday was directly under Davy's influence, and was occupied chiefly in chemical investigations. But in 1821, when the new field of inquiry opened by Oersted's discovery was attracting attention, he wrote an Historical Sketch of Electro-Magnetism,[1] as a preparation for which he carefully repeated the experiments described by the writers he was reviewing, and this seems to have been the beginning of the researches to which his fame is chiefly due.

The memoir which stands first in the published volumes of Faraday's electrical work[2] was communicated to the Royal Society on November 24th, 1831. The investigation was inspired, as he tells us, by the hope of discovering analogies between the behaviour of electricity as observed in motion in currents, and the behaviour of electricity at rest on conductors. Static electricity was known to possess the power of "induction"—i.e., of causing an opposite electrical state on bodies in its neighbourhood; was it not possible that electric currents might show a similar property? The idea at first was that if in any circuit a current were made to flow, any adjacent circuit would be traversed by an induced current, which would persist exactly as long as the inducing current. Faraday found that this was not the case; a current was indeed induced, but it lasted only for an instant, being in fact perceived only when the primary current was started or stopped. It depended, as he soon convinced himself, not on the mere existence of the inducing current, but on its variation.

Faraday now set himself to determine the laws of induction of currents, and for this purpose devised a new way of representing the state of a magnetic field, Philosophers had been long accustomed[3] to illustrate magnetic power by strewing iron filings on a sheet of paper, and observing the curves in which they dispose themselves when a magnet is brought underneath. These curves suggested to Faraday[4] the idea of lines of magnetic force, or curves whose direction at every point coincides with the direction of the magnetic intensity at that point; the curves in which the iron filings arrange themselves on the paper resemble these curves so far is possible subject to the condition of not leaving the plane of the paper.

With these lines of magnetic force Faraday conceived all space to be filled. Every line of force is a closed curve, which in some part of its course passes through the magnet to which it belongs.[5] Hence if any small closed curve be taken in space, the lines of force which intersect this curve must form a tubular surface returning into itself, such a surface is called a tube of force. From a tube of force we may derive information not only regarding the direction of the magnetic intensity, but also regarding its magnitude; for the product of this magnitude[6] and the cross-section of any tube is constant along the entire length of the tube.[7] On the basis of this result, Faraday conceived the idea of partitioning all space into -compartments by tubes, each tube being such that this product has the same definite value. For simplicity, each of these tubes may be called a "unit line of force"; the strength of the field is then indicated by the separation or concentration of the unit lines of force,[8] so that the number of them which intersect a unit area placed at right angles to their direction at any point measures the intensity of the magnetic field at that point.

Faraday constantly thought in terms of lines of force writing in 1851:

"I cannot refrain [9] from again expressing my conviction of the truthfulness of tho representation, which the idea of lines of force affords in regard to magnetic action. All the points which are experimentally established in regard to that action—i.e. all that is not hypothetical—appear to be well and truly represented by it."[10]

Faraday found that a current is induced in a circuit either when the strength of an adjacent current is altered, or when a magnet is brought near to the circuit, or when the circuit itself is moved about in presence of another current or a magnet. He saw from the first[11] that in all cases the induction depends on the relative motion of the circuit and the lines of magnetic force in its vicinity. 

The precise nature of this dependence was the subject of long-continued further experiments. In 1832 he found[12] that the currents produced by induction under the same circumstances in different wires are proportional to the conducting powers of the wires—a result which showed that the induction consists in the production of a definite electromotive force, independent of the nature of the wire, and dependent only on the intersections of the wire and the magnetic curves. This electromotive force is produced whether the wire forms a closed circuit (so that a current flows) or is open (so that electric tension results).

All that now remained was to inquire in what way the electromotive force depends on the relative motion of the wire and the lines of force. The answer to this inquiry is, in Faraday's own words,[13] that "whether the wire moves directly or obliquely across the lines of force, in one direction or another, it sums up the amount of the forces represented by the lines it has crossed," so that "the quantity of electricity thrown into a current is directly as the number of curves intersected."[14] The induced electromotive force is, in fact, simply proportional to the number of the unit lines of magnetic force intersected by the wire per second.

This is the fundamental principle of the induction of currents. Faraday is undoubtedly entitled to the full honour of its discovery; but for a right understanding of the progress of electrical theory at this period, it is necessary to remember that many years elapsed before all the conceptions involved in Faraday's principle became clear and familiar to his contemporaries; and that in the meantime the problem of formulating the laws of induced currents was approached with success from other points of view. There were indeed many obstacles to the direct appropriation of Faraday's work by the mathematical physicists of his own generation; not being himself a mathematician, he was unable to address them in their own language; and his favourite mode of representation by moving lines of force repelled analysts who had been trained in the school of Laplace and Poisson. Moreover, the idea of electromotive force itself, which had been applied to currents a few years previously in Ohm's memoir, was, as we have seen, still involved in obscurity and misapprehension.

A curious question which arose out of Faraday's theory was whether a bar-magnet which is rotated on its own axis carries its lines of magnetic force in rotation with it. Faraday himself believed that the lines of force do not rotate[15]: on this view a revolving magnet like the earth is to be regarded as moving through its own lines of force, so that it must become charged at the equator and poles with electricity of opposite signs, and if a wire not partaking in the earth's rotation were to have sliding contact with the earth at a pole and at the equator, a current would steadily flow through it. 

Experiments confirmatory of these views were made by Faraday himself;[16] but they do not strictly prove his hypothesis that the lines of force remain at rest; for it is easily seen[17] that, if they were to rotate, that part of the electromotive force which would be produced by their rotation would be derivable from a potential, and so would produce no effect in closed circuits such as Faraday used.

Three years after the commencement of Faraday's researches on induced currents he was led to an important extension of them by an observation which was communicated to him by another worker. William Jenkin had noticed that an electric shock may be obtained with no more powerful source of electricity than a single cell, provided the wire through which the current passes is long and coiled; the shock being felt when contact is broken.[18] As Jenkin did not choose to investigate the matter further, Faraday took it up, and showed[19] that the powerful momentary current, which was observed when the circuit was interrupted, was really an induced current governed by the same laws as all other induced currents, but with this peculiarity, that the induced and inducing currents now flowed in the same circuit. In fact, the current in its steady state establishes in the surrounding region a magnetic field, whose lines of force are linked with the circuit; and the removal of these lines of force when the circuit is broken originates an induced current, which greatly reinforces the primary current just before its final extinction. To this phenomenon the name of self-induction has been given.

The circumstances attending the discovery of self-induction occasioned a comment from Faraday on the number of suggestions which were continually being laid before him. He remarked that although at different times a large number of authors had presented him with their ideas, this case of Jenkin was the only one in which any result had followed. "The volunteers are serious embarrassments generally to the experienced philosopher."[20]

The discoveries of Oersted, Ampère, and Faraday had shown the close connexion of magnetic with electric science. But the connexion of the different branches of electric science with each other was still not altogether clear. Although Wollaston's experiments of 1801 had in effect proved the identity in kind of the currents derived from frictional and voltaic sources, the question was still regarded as open thirty years afterwards,[21] no satisfactory explanation being forthcoming of the fact that frictional electricity appeared to be a surface-phenomenon, whereas voltaic electricity was conducted within the interior substance of bodies. To this question Faraday now applied himself; and in 1833 he succeeded[22] in showing that every known effect of electricity-physiological, magnetic, luminous, calorific, chemical, and mechanical-may be obtained indifferently either with the electricity which is obtained by friction or with that obtained from a voltaic battery. Henceforth the identity of the two was beyond dispute.

Some misapprehension, however, has existed among later writers as to the conclusions which may be drawn from this identification. What Faraday proved is that the process which goes on in a wire connecting the terminals of a voltaic cell is of the same nature as the process which for a short time goes on in a wire by which a condenser is discharged. He did not prove, and did not profess to have proved, that this process consists in the actual movement of a quasi-substance, electricity, from one plate of the condenser to the other, or of two quasi-substances, the resinous and vitreous electricities, in opposite directions. The process had been pictured in this way by many of his predecessors, notably by Volta; and it has since been so pictured by most of his successors: but from such assumptions Faraday himself carefully abstained.

What is common to all theories, and is universally conceded, is that the rate of increase in the total quantity of electrostatic charge within any volume-element is equal to the excess of the influx over the efflux of current from it. This statement may be represented by the equation

where ρ denotes the volume-density of electrostatic charge, and i the current, at the place (x, y, z) at the time t. Volta's assumption is really one way of interpreting this equation physically: it presents itself when we compare equation (1) with the equation


which is the equation of continuity for a fluid of density ρ and velocity v: we may identify the two equations by supposing i to be of the same physical nature as the product ρv; and this is precisely what is done by those who accept Volta's assumption.

But other assumptions might be made which would equally well furnish physical interpretations to equation (1). For instance, if we suppose ρ to be the convergence of any vector of which i is the time-flux,[23] equation (1) is satisfied automatically; 196 Faraday. we can picture this vector as being of the nature of a displacement. By such an assumption we should avoid altogether the necessity for regarding the conduction-current as an actual flow of electric charges, or for speculating whether the drifting charges are positive or negative; and there would be no longer anything surprising in the production of a null effect by the coalescence of electric charges of opposite signs.

Faraday himself wished to leave the matter open, and to avoid any definite assumption.[24] Perhaps the best indication of his views is afforded by a laboratory note[25] of date 1837:—

"After much consideration of the manner in which the electric forces are arranged in the various phenomena generally I have come to certain conclusions which I will endeavour to note down without committing myself to any opinion as to the cause of electricity, i.e., as to the nature of the power. If electricity exist independently of matter, then I think that the hypothesis of one fluid will not stand against that of two fluids. There are, I think, evidently what I may call two elements of power, of equal force and acting toward each other. But these powers may be distinguished only by direction, and may be no more separate than the north and south forces in the elements of a magnetic needle. They may be the polar points of the forces originally placed in the particles of matter."

Ever since the rise of the mathematical theory of electrostatics, the controversy between the supporters of the one-fluid and the two-fluid theories had become manifestly barren. 


The interest was now largely centred on analytical equations. These could be interpreted equally well on either hypothesis.

There was little prospect of discriminating between them by any new experimental discovery. 

But a problem does not lose its fascination because it appears insoluble. "I said once to Faraday," wrote Stokes to his father-in-law in 1879, "as I sat beside him at a British Association dinner, that I thought a great step would be made when we should be able to say of electricity that which we say of light, in saying that it consists of undulations. He said to me he thought we were a long way off that yet."[26]

For his next series of researches,[27] Faraday reverted to subjects which had been among the first to attract him as an apprentice attending Davy's lectures: the voltaic pile, and the relations of electricity to chemistry.

It was at this time generally supposed that the decomposition of a solution, through which an electric current is passed, is due primarily to attractive and repellent forces exercised on its molecules by the metallic terminals at which the current enters and leaves the solution. Such forces had been assumed both in the hypothesis of Grothuss and Davy, and in the rival hypothesis of De La Rive;[28] the chief difference between these Being that whereas Grothuss and Davy supposed a chain of decompositions and recompositions in the liquid, De La Rive supposed the molecules adjacent to the terminals to be the only ones decomposed, and attributed to their fragments the power of travelling through the liquid from one terminal to the other.

To test this doctrine of the influence of terminals, Faraday moistened a piece of paper in a saline solution, and supported it in the air on wax, so as to occupy part of the interval between two needle-points which were connected with an electric machine. When the machine was worked, the current was conveyed between the needle-points by way of the moistened paper and the two air-intervals on either side of it; and under these circumstances it was found that the salt underwent decomposition. Since in this case no metallic terminals of any kind were in contact with the solution, it was evident that all hypotheses which attributed decomposition to the action of the terminals were untenable.

The ground being thus cleared by the demolition of previous theories, Faraday was at liberty to construct a theory of his He retained one of the ideas of Grothuss' and Davy's doctrine, namely, that a chain of decompositions and recombinations takes place in the liquid; but these molecular processes he attributed not to any action of the terminals, but to a power possessed by the electric current itself, at all places in its course through the solution. If as an example we consider neighbouring molecules A, B, C, D, ... of the compound—say water, which was at that time believed to be directly decomposed by the current—Faraday supposed that before the passage of the current the hydrogen of A would be in close union with the oxygen of A, and also in a less close relation with the oxygen atoms of B, C, D, ...: these latter relations being conjectured to be the cause of the attraction of aggregation in solids and fluids.[29] When an electric current is sent through the liquid, the affinity of the hydrogen of A for the oxygen of B is strengthened, if A and B lie along the direction of the current; while the hydrogen of A withdraws some of its bonds from the oxygen of A, with which it is at the moment combined. So long as the hydrogen and oxygen of A remain in association, the state thus induced is merely one of polarization; but the compound molecule is unable to stand the strain thus imposed on it, and the hydrogen and oxygen of A part company from each other, Thus decompositions take place, followed by recombinations: with the result that after each exchange an oxygen atom associates itself with a partner nearer to the positive terminal, while a hydrogen atom associates with a partner nearer to the negative terminal.

This theory explains why, in all ordinary cases, the evolved substances appear only at the terminals; for the terminals are the limiting surfaces of the decomposing substance; and, except. at them, every particle finds other particles having a contrary tendency with which it can combine. It also explains why, in numerous cases, the atoms of the evolved substances are not retained by the terminals (an obvious difficulty in the way of all theories which suppose the terminals to attract the atoms): for the evolved substances are expelled from the liquid, not drawn out by an attraction.

Many of the perplexities which had harassed the older theories were at once removed when the phenomena were regarded from Faraday's point of view. Thus, mere mixtures (as opposed to chemical compounds) are not separated into their constituents by the electric current; although there would seem to be no reason why the Grothuss-Davy polar attraction should not operate as well on elements contained in mixtures as on elements contained in compounds.

In the latter part of the same year (1833) Faraday took up the subject again.[30] It was at this time that he introduced the terms which have ever since been generally used to describe the phenomena of electro-chemical decomposition. To the terminals by which the electric current passes into or out of the decomposing body he gave the name electrodes. The electrode of high potential, at which oxygen, chlorine, acids, &c., are evolved, he called the anode, and the electrode of low potential, at which metals, alkalis, and bases are evolved, the cathode. Those bodies which are decomposed directly by the current he named electrolytes; the parts into which they are decomposed, ions; the acid ions, which travel to the anode, he named anions; and the metallic ions, which pass to the cathode, cations,

Faraday now proceeded to test the truth of a supposition which he had published rather more than a year previously,[31] and which indeed had apparently been suspected by Gay-Lussac and Thénard[32] so early as 1811; namely, that the rate at which an electrolyte is decomposed depends solely on the intensity of the electric current passing through it, and not at all on the size of the electrodes or the strength of the solution. Having established the accuracy of this law,[33] he found by a comparison of different electrolytes that the mass of any ion liberated by a given quantity of electricity is proportional to its chemical equivalent, i.e. to the amount of it required to combine with some standard mass of some standard element. If an element is n-valent, so that one of its atoms can hold in combination n atoms of hydrogen, the chemical equivalent of this element may be taken to be 1/n of its atomic weight; and therefore Faraday's result may be expressed by saying that an electric current will liberate exactly one atom of the element in question in the time which it would take to liberate n atoms of hydrogen.[34]

The quantitative law seemed to Faraday[35] to indicate that "the atoms of matter are in some way endowed or associated with electrical powers, to which they owe their most striking qualities, and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity."

Looking at the facts of electrolytic decomposition from this point of view, he showed how natural it is to suppose that the electricity which passes through the electrolyte is the exact equivalent of that which is possessed by the atoms separated at the electrodes; which implies that there is a certain absolute quantity of the electric power associated with each atom of matter.

The claims of this splendid speculation he advocated with conviction. "The harmony," he wrote,[36] "which it introduces into the associated theories of definite proportions and electro-chemical affinity is very great. According to it, the equivalent weights of bodies are simply those quantities of them which contain equal quantities of electricity, or have naturally equal electric powers; it being the electricity which determines tho equivalent number, because it determines the combining force. Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the atoms of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action, have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them. "But," he added, "I must confess I am jealous of the term atom: for though it is very easy to talk of atoms, it is very difficult to form a clear idea of their nature, especially when compound bodies are under consideration."

These discoveries and ideas tended to confirm Faraday in preferring, among the rival theories of the voltaic cell, that one to which all his antecedents and connexions predisposed him. The controversy between the supporters of Volta's contact hypothesis on the one hand, and the chemical hypothesis of Davy and Wollaston on the other, had now been carried on for a generation without any very decisive result. In Germany and Italy the contact explanation was generally accepted, under the influence of Christian Heinrich Pfaff, of Kiel (b. 1773, d. 1852), and of Ohm, and, among the younger men, of Gustav Theodor Fechner (b. 1801, d. 1887), of Leipzig,[37] and Stefano Marianini (b. 1790, d. 1866), of Modena. Among French writers De La Rive, of Geneva, was, as we have seen, active in support of the chemical hypothesis; and this side in the dispute had always been favoured by the English philosophers.

There is no doubt that when two different metals are put in contact, a difference of potential is set up between them without any apparent chemical action; but while the contact party regarded this as a direct manifestation of a "contact-force" distinct in kind from all other known forces of nature, the chemical party explained it as a consequence of chemical affinity or incipient chemical action between the metals and the surrounding air or moisture. There is also no doubt that the continued activity of a voltaic cell is always accompanied by chemical unions or decompositions; but while the chemical party asserted that these constitute the efficient source of the current, the contact party regarded them as secondary actions, and attributed the continual circulation of electricity to the perpetual tendency of the electromotive force of contact to transfer charge from one substance to another.
