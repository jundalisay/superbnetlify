## Proposition 24 Theorem 19

The quantities of matter in funependulous bodies, whose centres of oscillation are equally distant from, the centre of suspension, are in a, ratio compounded of the ratio of the weights and the duplicate ratio of the times of the oscillations in vacuo.

The velocity which a given force can generate in a given matter in a given time is as the force and the time directly, and the matter inversely.

The greater the force or the time is, or the less the matter, the greater velocity will be generated. This is in the 2nd Law of Motion. 

In pendulums of the same length, the motive forces in places equally distant from the perpendicular are as the weights

But the

For when I immersed a pendulous globe, whose diameter was one inch

the thread just above the water, and, by oscillating in the air, assisted the
motion of the pendulum, and continued it longer. The experiments made

be accurate enough, especially if the experiments be made with larger

greater resistance of the full box arises not from any other latent cause,
but only from the action of some subtile fluid upon the included metal.
This experiment is related by memory, the paper being lost in which I
had described it so that I have been obliged to omit some fractional parts,
which are slipt out of my memory and I have no leisure to try it again.
The first time I made it, the hook being weak, the full box was retarded
sooner.
The cause I found to be, that the hook was not strong enough to
bear the weight of the box so that, as it oscillated to and fro, the hook
was bent sometimes this and sometimes that way. I therefore procured a
