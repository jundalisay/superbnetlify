## PROPOSITION 10 PROBLEM 3

Suppose the uniform force of gravity to tend directly to the plane of the
horizon, and the resistance to be as the density of the medium and the
square of the velocity coiijunctly = it is proposed to find the density of
the medium in each place, which shall make the body move in any
given carve line ; the velocity of the body and the resistance of the
medium
