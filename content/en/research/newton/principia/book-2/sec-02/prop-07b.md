## LEMMA 2

The moment of any genitum is equal to the moments of each of the generatinrr sides drawn into the indices of the powers of those sides, and
into their co-efficients continually.
I call any quantity a genitum which is not made by addition or subduction of divers parts, but is generated or produced in arithmetic by the
multiplication, division, or extraction of the root of any terms whatsoever

means of proportionals. Quantities of this kind are products, quotients,
roots, rectangles, squares, cubes, square and cubic sides, and the like.
