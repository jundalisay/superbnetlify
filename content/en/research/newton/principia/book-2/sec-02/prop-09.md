## PROPOSITION 9 THEOREM 7

that if the tangents of
t-he
angles of the sector of a circle, and of an hyperbola, be taken propor
tional to the velocities, the radius being of a fit magnitude, all the time
of the ascent to the highest place icill be as the sector of the circle, and
time of descending from the highest place as the sector of t/ie
