## Proposition 41 Theorem 32

A pressure is only propagated through a fluid in a line if its particles are in a line

If partciles a b c d e are in line, the pressure can travel from a to e. 

But e will urge f and g obliquely. f and g will not sustain this pressure unless supported by h and k lying beyond them. 

But those supporting particles will be  also press on others infinitely. 

Therefore the pressure, as soon as it is propagated to particles that lie out of
right lines, begins to deflect towards one hand and the other, and will be
propagated obliquely in infinitum ; and after it has begun to be propagat
ed obliquely, if it line, it will deflect
more distant particles lying out of the right
again on each hand and this it will do as often as it

The velocity of waves is in the subduplicate ratio of the breadths.
This follows from the construction of the following Proposition.

### P46 PROBLEM 10

To find the velocity of waves.
Let a pendulum be constructed, whose length between the point of sus
pension and the centre of oscillation is equal to the breadth of the waves and in the time that the pendulum will perform one single oscillation the waves will advance forward nearly a space equal to their breadth.

Because the motion of

the waves is
carried on by the successive ascent and descent of the water,
which are highest at one time
so that the parts thereof, as A, C, E, &c.,
become lowest immediately after and because the motive force, by which
the highest parts descend and the lowest ascend, is the weight of the elevated water, that alternate ascent and descent will be analogous to the recip

distances between the highest places of the waves A, C, E, and the lowest

A, C, E, will become the lowest in the time of one oscillation, and in the
time of another oscillation will ascend again. Therefore between the pas

wave will describe its breadth in the time that pendulum will oscillate
twice; but a pendulum of four times that length, and which therefore is
equal to the breadth of the waves, will just oscillate once in that time.

when the mercury in the barometer is at the height of 30 inches of our

For M. Sauveur, by some experiments that he made, found that an
open pipe about five Paris feet in length gives a sound of the same tone
with a viol-string that vibrates a hundred times in one second. Therefore
there are near 10J pulses in a space of 1070 Paris feet, which a sound runs

are equal to twice the length of the pipes.
Moreover, from the Corollary of Prop. XLVIt appears the reason why
the sounds immediately cease with the motion of the sonorous body, and
they are heard no longer when we are at a great distance from the
sonorous bodies than when we are very near them.
