## Proposition 4 Problem 2

Supposing the force of gravity in any similar medium to be uniform, and to tend perpendicularly to the plane of the horizon ; to define the motion of a projectile therein, which
suffers resistance proportional to its velocity.

Let us, therefore, see what motions arise from this law of
