## Proposition 1 Theory 1

If a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, the motion lost by resistance is as the space gone over in its motion.

For since the motion lost in each equal particle of time is as the velocity, that is, as the particle of space gone over, then, by composition, the motion lost in the whole time will he as the whole space gone over.

### Corollary 

Therefore if the body, destitute of all gravity, move by its innate and there be given both its whole motion at the
beginning, and also the motion remaining after some part of the way is gone over, there will be given also the whole space which the body can describe in an infinite time.

For that space will be to the space now described as the whole force only in free spaces, motion at the beginning
is to the part lost of that motion.
