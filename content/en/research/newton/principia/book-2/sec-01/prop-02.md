## Proposition 3 Problem 1

A body which, in a similar medium, ascends or define the motion of

acted upon by an uniform force of gravity.

### Corollary 3

Also the differences of the spaces, which are described in equal differences of the times, decrease in the same
geometrical progression.

The space described by the body is the difference of two of the spaces, whereof one is as the time taken from the
