#### What is a fluid?

A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force impressed on it and are easily moved among themselves.

All the parts of a homogeneous and unmoved fluid included

That the pressure
is not altered by any of these circumstances,
may be collected by applying
the demonstration of this Theorem to the several cases of fluids.

take place in any other centripetal forces.

Therefore if the medium in which any body moves be acted on either by its own gravity, or by any other centripetal force, and the body be urged more powerfully by the same force the difference of the forces is

sation did arise from the motion of their parts, the fluid will neither hurt
the immersed bodies, nor excite any sensation, unless so far as those bodies
may be condensed by the compression. And the case is the same of any
system of bodies encompassed with a compressing fluid. All the parts of
the system will be agitated with the same motions as if they were placed
unless so

far as the fluid
may somewhat

be requisite to con-
glutinate them by compression.
