## Proposition 23 Theorem 18

If a fluid be composed of particles mutually flying each other, and the
drnsity be as the compression, the centrifugal forces of the particles
will be reciprocally proportional to tlie distances of their centres.

And vice versa, particles flying each otli,er, with forces that are reciprocally
proportional to the distances of their centres^ compose an elastic fluid, whose density is as the compression. 

Let the fluid be supposed to be included in a cubic space ACE, and then to be reduced by compression into A a lesser cubic space ace ; and the distances of the partides retaining a like situation with respect to each
other in both the spaces, will be as the sides AB, ab of
