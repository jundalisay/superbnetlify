conceived to go forward with the same velocity in the direction of its axis
through the same medium and let us suppose that the particles of the

medium, on which the globe
or cylinder falls, fly back with as great a force
of reflexion as possible.
Then since the resistance of the globe (by the last
Proposition) is but half the resistance of the cylinder, and since the globe
is to
the cylinder as

and since the cylinder by falling perpendicu

nicates to them a velocity double to its own; it follows that the cylinder.

SCHOLIUM.
I
have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation of
spherical projectiles in mediums that are not continued, and shewn that
this resistance is to the force by which the whole motion of the globe may be
destroyed or produced in the time in which the globe can describe two thirds
of its diameter, with a velocity uniformly continued, as the density of the
medium to the density of the globe, if so be the globe and the particles of
the medium be perfectly elastic, and are endued with the utmost force of
and that this force, where the globe and particles of the medium
reflexion
are infinitely hard and void of any reflecting force, is diminished one half.
But in continued mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as
it
passes through them does not immediately strike against all the parti
