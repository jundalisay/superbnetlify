Suppose two similar systems of bodies with an equal number of particles with the same density.

Like bodies in like situations move with like motions and times. This includes their particles, as per Law 1. 

But if they agitate each other then their partciles wll also be agitated.

will be so (by Cor. 1 and S,
Prop. IV. ; Book 1), if those centres are at rest
but if they are moved, yet by reason of the similitude of the
translations,
their situations
among the particles of the system will remain similar , so
that the changes introduced into the
figures described by the particles will
still be similar.

to move
among those parts in like manner and in proportional times and
will therefore describe spaces proportional to their diameters.
