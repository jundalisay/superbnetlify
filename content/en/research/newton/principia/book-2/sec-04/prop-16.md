This Proposition and the former, which
relate to
mediums of unequal
density, are to be understood of the motion of bodies that are so small, that

away, or the defect supplied.

medium, by
velocity being given, shall revolve in a
given spiral.
Let that
spiral be
PQR.
From
the velocity,
with which the body goes over the very small arc
PQ,, the time will be given and from the altitude
TQ,, which is as the centripetal force, and the

square of the time, that force will be given. Then
from the difference RSr of the areas PSQ, and

the retardation will be found the resisting force

From the centripetal force the velocity in each place must be found
