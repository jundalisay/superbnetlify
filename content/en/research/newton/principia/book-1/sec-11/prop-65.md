lesser bodies may be so far diminished, as that this recess and the mutual

and therefore so as that the orbits may become ellipses, and the areas an
swer to the times, without any error that is not less than any assignable.

### CASE 2

Let us imagine a system of lesser bodies revolving about a very great one in the manner just described, or any other system of two bodies actions of the bodies on each other revolving about each other to be moving uniformly forward in a right line, and in the mean time to be impelled sideways by the force of another vastly greater body situate at a great distance. And because the equal accelerative forces with which the bodies are impelled in parallel directions do not change the situation of the bodies with respect to each other, but only oblige the whole system to change its place while the parts still retain their motions among themselves, it is manifest that no change in those motions of the attracted bodies can arise from their attractions towards the greater, unless by the inequality of the accelerative attractions, or by the inclinations of the lines towards each other, in whose directions the attractions are made.

Suppose, accelerative attractions made towards the great body
