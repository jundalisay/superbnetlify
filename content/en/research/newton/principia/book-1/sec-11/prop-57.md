We have been describing the attractions of bodies towards an immovable centre. But there is probably no such thing, because attractions are made towards bodies, and the actions of the bodies attracted and attracting are always reciprocal and equal, by Law 3. 

If there are two bodies, neither the attracted nor the attracting body is truly at rest. But both revolve around a centre of gravity.

If there are more bodies, which are either attracted by one single one which is attracted by them again, or which all of them, attract each other mutually these bodies will be so moved among themselves, that their common centre of gravity will either be at rest, or move uniformly forward in a line. 

I shall thus talk about the motion of bodies mutually attracting each other considering the centripetal forces as attractions or "impulses".

<!-- But
these propositions are to be considered as purely
mathematical; and therefore, laying aside all physical considerations, I
make use of a familiar way of speaking, to make myself the more easily
understood by a mathematical reader. -->

## PROPOSITION 58 THEOREM 21

If two bodies attract each other mutually with forces of any kind, and
in the mean time revolve about the common centre of gravity ; I say,
by the same forces, there may be described round either body un

moving describe round each other mutually.

### CASE 2

Suppose now that the common centre of gravity, together with the space in which the bodies are moved among themselves, proceeds uni formly in a right line and (by Cor. 6, of the Laws of Motion) all the mo

therefore the bodies will describe mutually about each other the same fig

### Corollary 2

Two bodies, whose forces are reciprocally proportional to
the square of their distance, describe (by Prop. XI, XII, XIII), both round
their common centre of gravity, and round each other mutually, conic sec
tions
having their focus in the centre about which the figures are described.
And, vice versa, if such figures are described, the centripetal forces are re
ciprocally proportional to the squares of the distance.

Any two bodies revolving round their common centre of gravity describe areas proportional to the times,
