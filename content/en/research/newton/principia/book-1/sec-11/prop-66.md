## PROPOSITION 66 THEOREM 26

If 3 bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances attract each other mutually ; and the accelerative attractions of any two towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares,
of the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; The interior of the tivo revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the innermost and greatest, describe round thai body areas more proportional to the times, and a figure more approaching to that of an ellipse in the point of concourse of the radii, if that great

This appears plainly enough from the demonstration of the second
Corollary of tl.e foregoing Proposition; but it may be made out after
this manner by a way of reasoning more distinct and more universally
convincing.

It also follows,
from what was before laid down, that the axis
of the ellipsis described by the body P, or the line of the apsides, does as
to its angular motion go forwards and backwards by turns, but more for
