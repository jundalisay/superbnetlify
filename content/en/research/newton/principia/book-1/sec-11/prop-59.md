## PROPOSITION 59 THEOREM 22

Their common periodic time of two bodies S and P revolving around centre of gravity C, is to the periodic time of one of the bwlies 1? revolving round the other S remaining unmoved, and describing a shape similar and equal to those which the bodies describe about each 

The other mutually , in a subduplicate ratio of the other body

For, by the demonstration of the last Proposition, the times in which

## PROPOSITION 61 THEOREM 24

If two bodies attracting each other with any kind of forces, and not otherwise agitated or obstructed, are moved in any manner whatsoever, those motions will be the same as if they did not at all attract each other mutually, but were both attracted with the same forces by a third body placed in their common centre of gravity ; and the law of the attracting Jones will be the sam# in respect of the distance of the.
bodies from, the common centre, as in respect of the distance between the two bodies.

For those forces with which the bodies attract each other mutually, by
tending to the bodies, tend also to the common centre of gravity lying di
between them and therefore are the same as if they proceeded from
an intermediate body.

Because there is given the ratio of the distance of either body from that common centre to the distance between the two bodies, there is given, rectly
any power of one distance to the same power of the
any quantity derived in any manner
from one of the distances compounded any how with given quantities, to
another quantity derived in like manner from the other distance, and as
of course, the ratio of
ther distance
and

also the ratio of
many given quantities having that given ratio of the distances to the first
Therefore if the force with which one body is attracted by another be di
rectly or inversely as the distance of the bodies from each other, or as any
power of that distance or, lastly, as any quantity derived after any man

be the same with respect to both distances.
