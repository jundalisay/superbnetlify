But if a curvilinear figure is to be transformed, we
must transfer the points, the tangents, and other right lines, by means of
which the curve line is denned. This Lemma is of use in the solution of

This Lemma is also of use in the solution of solid problems. For as
often as two conic sections occur, by the intersection of which a problem
may be solved, any one of them may be transformed, if it is an hyperbola
or a parabola, into an ellipsis, and then this ellipsis may be easily changed
