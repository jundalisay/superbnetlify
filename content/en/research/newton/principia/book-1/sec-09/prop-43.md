## PROPOSITION 43 Problem 30

Make a body move in a trajectory that revolves around the center of force in the same way as another body in the same trajectory at rest

In the orbit VPK given by position, let
the body P revolve proceeding from V towards K.

From the centre C let there be continually drawn Cp equal to CP making the angle VCp proportional to the angle CVP. 

The area which the line Cp describes will be to the area VCP
