## Proposition 82 Theorem 41

In a sphere described about the centre S with the interval SA, if there be
taken SI, SA, SP continually proportional ; ! sat/, that the attraction,
of a corpuscle within the sphere in any place I is to its attraction without
the sphere in the place P in a ratio compounded of the subduplicate
ratio of IS, PS, the distances from the centre, and the subduplicate
ratio of tJie centripetal forces tending to the centre in those places P and I.

As if the centripetal forces of the particles

of the distance SI to the distance SP, and the subduplicate

the centre that is, in the subduplicate ratio of the distances SI, SP to each

other reciprocally.
These two subduplicate ratios compose the ratio of
equality, and therefore the attractions in I and P produced by the whole
sphere are equal.
By the like calculation, if the forces of the particles of
the sphere are reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the distances, it will be
