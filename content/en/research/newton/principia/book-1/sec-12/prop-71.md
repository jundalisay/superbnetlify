## Proposition 74 THEOREM 34

A corpuscle situate without the sphere is attracted with a force reciprocally proportional to the square
of its distance from the centre.

For suppose the sphererical superficies, to be divided into innumerable concentric sphe
and the attractions of the corpuscle arising from the sev
eral superficies will be reciprocally proportional to the square of the dis
tance of the corpuscle from the centre of the sphere (by Prop. LXXI).
And, by composition, the sum of those attractions, that is, the attraction
of the corpuscle towards the entire sphere, will be in the same ratio.

### Corollary 1 

Hence the attractions of homogeneous spheres at equal distances from the centres will be as the spheres themselves. For (by Prop. LXXII) the distances be proportional to the diameters of the spheres, the forces

COR. 3. If a corpuscle placed without an homogeneous sphere is attract

the centre, and the sphere consists of attractive particles, the force of ever y

the attraction of the sphere, equal thereto, is also in the same ratio.

### Corollary 1

The attractions of spheres towards other homogeneous spheres
are as the attracting spheres applied to the squares of the distances of their
centres from the centres of those which they attract.
