## PROPOSITION 76 THEOREM 36

If spheres be however dissimilar (as to density of matter and attractive,
force] in the same ratio onward from the centre to the circumference ; but every where similar, at every given distance from the centre, on all round about ; and the attractive force of every point decreases in the duplicate ratio of the distance of the body attracted that the whole force with which one of these spheres attracts the oilier
will be reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance of the sides centres.

Imagine several concentric similar spheres,
most of AB, CD, EF,
which added
&c.. the inner
to the outermost
a matter more dense to
wards the centre, or subducted from
them may leave the same more lax and
may compose

Then, by Prop.
LXXV,
these

&c., each the other, with forces reciprocally

And, by composition or
square
of all those forces, or the excess of any of them above

posed of any concentric spheres or of their differences) will attract the

ratio. Let the number of the concentric spheres be increased
whole sphere
in the
same
in infinitum, so that the density of the matter together with the attractive
force may, in the progress from the circumference to the centre, increase or
and by the addition of matter not at

#### Corollary 1 

#### Corollary 2

Many spheres of this kind, similar in all respects, at
tract each other mutually, the accelerative attractions of each to each, at
any equal distances of the centre s, will be as the attracting spheres.
if
at
any unequal distances, as the attracting spheres applied
between the centres.
to the squares of the distances


#### Corollary 3

The motive attractions, or the weights of the spheres towards one another, will be at equal distances of the centres as the attracting and that is, as the products arising from multi attracted spheres conjunctly
plying the spheres into each other.


#### Corollary 4

At unequal distances, as those products directly, and the squares of the distances between the centres inversely.

#### Corollary 5

These proportions take place also when the attraction arises from the attractive virtue of both spheres mutually exerted upon each For the attraction is only doubled by the conjunction of the forces, other.
the proportions remaining as before.


#### Corollary 6

If spheres of this kind revolve about others at rest, each about each and the distances between the centres of the quiescent and revolving bodies are proportional to the diameters of the quiescent bodies periodic times will be equal.


#### Corollary 7 

If the periodic times are equal, the distances will be proportional to the diameters.

#### Corollary 8

All those truths above demonstrated, relating to the motions
if bodies about the foci of conic sections, will take place when an attract
ing sphere, of any form and condition like that above described, is placed
in the focus.

#### Corollary 9

When the revolving bodies are also attracting spheres any condition like that above described.224
