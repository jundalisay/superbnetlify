### Corollary 2

Vice versa, if the periodic times are equal, the distances will be proportional to the diameters.
These two Corollaries appear from Cor. 3, Prop. IV.

### Corollary 3 

If to the several points of an^ two solids whatever, of like figare and equal density, there tend equal centripetal forces decreasing in a
