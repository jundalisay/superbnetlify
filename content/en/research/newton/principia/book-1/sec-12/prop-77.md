## Proposition 77 Theorem 37

The several points of spheres there tend centripetal forces proportional to the distances of the points from the attracted bodies  that the compounded force with which two
spheres attract each other

as the distance between the centres of the spheres.

By a like reasoning, the forces of all the planes in the

whole sphere, equi-distant on each side from the centre of the sphere, are
as the sum of those planes drawn into the distance PS, that is, as the
whole sphere and the distance PS conjunctly. Q,.E.D.
2. Let now the corpuscle P attract the sphere AEBF.
And, by
same reasoning, it will appear that the force with which the sphere is
attracted is as the distance PS.



### CASE 3

Imagine another sphere composed of innumerable corpuscles P
and because the force with which every corpuscle is attracted is as the dis
tance of the corpuscle from the centre of the first sphere, and as the same

sphere conjunctly, and

therefore the

which all the corpuscles in the second sphere are attracted, that is, with
which that whole sphere
is
attracted, will be the
same
as if that sphere

were attracted by a force issuing from a single corpuscle in the centre of
and is therefore proportional to the distance between the
the first

centres of the spheres.

#### CASE 4

Let the spheres attract each other mutually, be doubled, but the proportion will remain.

and the force will

Let the corpuscle p be placed within the sphere AEBF
and because the force of the

plane ef upon the corpuscle is as the solid contain
ed under that plane and the distance jog ; and the
contrary force of the plane EF as the solid con
tained under that plane and the distance joG the
force compounded of both will be as the difference

of the corpuscle from the centre of the sphere.
And, by a like reasoning,
the attraction of all the planes EF, ef, throughout the whole sphere, that

is, the attraction of the whole sphere,
conjunctly as the sum of all the
whole sphere, and as joS, the distance of the corpuscle from
the centre of the sphere.

### Case 6

If there be composed a new sphere out of innumerable corpuscles such as 

planes, or as the

jo,
situate within the first sphere AEBF, it may be proved,
whether single of one sphere towards the
as before, that the attraction,
other, or
mutual of both towards each other, will be as the distance joS of the centres.
