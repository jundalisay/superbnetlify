by any sort of centripetal force.

## Proposition 40 Theorem 13

A body, acted upon by any centripetal force, is any how moved, and
another body ascends or descends in a right line, and their velocities
be equal in amj one case of equal altitudes, t/ieir velocities will be also
equal at all equal altitudes.

By the same reasoning, bodies of equal velocities and equal distances
