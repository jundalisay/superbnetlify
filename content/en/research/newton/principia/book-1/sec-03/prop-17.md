## Proposition 17 Problem 9

Supposing the centripetal force to be reciprocally proportional to the squares of the distances of places from the centre, and that the absolute quantity of that force is known.

Determine the line which a body will draw  that is let go from a given place with a given velocity in the direction of a given line

Let the centripetal force tending to the point S be such as will make the body p revolve in any given orbit pq. Suppose the velocity of this body in the place p is known.

be reciprocally as the square of the distance of the body from the centre
