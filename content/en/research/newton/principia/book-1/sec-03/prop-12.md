## PROPOSITION 12 Problem 12

Suppose a body to move in an hyperbola. It is required to find the law of the centripetal force tending to the focus of that shape.

Let:

- CA, CB are  the semi-axes of the hyperbola
- PG, KD are conjugate diameters
- PF is perpendicular to the diameter
and conjugate diameters
