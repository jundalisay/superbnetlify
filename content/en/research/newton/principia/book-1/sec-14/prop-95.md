## PROPOSITION 95 THEOREM 50

The motion before incidence is swifter than afterwards ; 1 sat/, lhat if the line of incidence be inclined continually, the body will be at last reflected, and the angle of reflexion will be equal to the
angle of incidence. 

For conceive the body passing between the parallel planes
Aa, Bb, Cc,

and let those arcs be HP, PQ, QR, &c.

emergence is now become equal to radius, the angle of emergence will be a
right one, and therefore the line of emergence will coincide with the plane
Dd. Let the body come to this plane in the point R and because the
that the sine of incidence in the emergence coincides with that plane, it is manifest that the body can

Moreover, the rays of light that are in
