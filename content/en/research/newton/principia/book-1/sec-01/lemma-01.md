## LEMMA 1

Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which continually converge to equality eventually become equal. 


## LEMMA 2

If any figure AacE, terminated by the right lines A a. AE, and the curve acE, there be inscribed any number of parallelograms Ab, Be, Cd, etc. comprehended under equal bases AB, BC, CD, etc., and the sides, Bb, Cc, Dd, etc., parallel to one side Aa of the figure.

The parallelograms aKbl, bLcm, cMdn, etc are completed.

If the width of those parallelograms are diminished, and their number augmented infinitely, then the ultimate ratios which the inscribed figure AKbLcMdD, the circumscribed figure AalbmcndoE, and the curvilinear figure AabcdE will have to one another, are ratios of equality.

For the difference of the inscribed and circumscribed figures is the sum of the parallelograms Kl, Lw, M. Do. that is (from the equality of all their bases), the rectangle under one of their bases Kb and the sum of their altitudes Aa, that
is, the rectangle ABla.

But this rectangle, because its width AB is supposed diminished infinitely, becomes less than any given space.

Therefore, by Lem. 1, the figures inscribed and circumscribed become ultimately equal one to the other; and much more will the intermediate curvilinear figure be ultimately equal to either.

## LEMMA 3

The same ultimate ratios are also ratios of equality, when the breadths AB, BC, DC, etc of the parallelograms are unequal, and are all diminished in infinitum.

For suppose AF equal to the greatest breadth, and complete the parallelogram FAaf. This parallelo
gram will be greater than the difference of the inscribed and circumscribed figures

If any arc ACB, given in position, is
