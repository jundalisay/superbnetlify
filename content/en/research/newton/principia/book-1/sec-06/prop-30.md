## Proposition 30 PROBLEM 22

Find at any time the place of a body moving in a given parabolic trajectory.

Let:

- S be the focus
- A the principal vertex of the parabola

Suppose 4AS x M equal to the parabolic area to be cut off APS, which either was described by the radius SP, since the body s departure

The time may be found in which the body has described any assigned arc AP.

### LEMMA 28 

There is no oval shape whose area, cut off by right lines at pleasure, can, be universally found by means of equations of any number of finite terms and dimensions.

Suppose that within the oval any point is given, about which as a pole a right line is perpetually revolving with an uniform motion, while in
that right line a mov cable point going out from the pole moves always
forward with a velocity proportional to the square of that right line with
in the oval.
By this motion that point will describe a spiral with infinite
Now if a portion of the area of the oval cut off by that

right line could be found by a finite equation, the distance of the point
from the pole, which is proportional to this area, might be found by the
same equation, and therefore all the points of the spiral might be found
by a finite equation also and therefore the intersection of a right line
given in position with the spiral might also be found by a finite equation.
But every right line infinitely produced cuts a spiral in an infinite num

And therefore
the intersection of a right line with a spiral cannot be universally found by
finite equation ; and of consequence there is no oval figure whose area,
any
cut off by right lines at pleasure, can be universally exhibited by an^
such equation.1

By the same argument, if the interval of the pole and point by which
the spiral is described is taken proportional to that part of the perimeter
of the oval which is cut off, it may be proved that the length of the peri
meter cannot be universally exhibited by any finite equation. But here I
