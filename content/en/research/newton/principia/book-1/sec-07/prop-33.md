## PROPOSITION 33 THEOREM 9

The velocity of a falling body in any place C is to the velocity of a body, describing a circle around B at the distance BC, in the subduplicate ratio of AC, the distance of the body from the remoter vertex A of the circle or  rectangular hyperbola, to 1/2 AB, the principal semi-diameter of the shape

Let AB, the common diameter of both figures RPB, DEBm be
