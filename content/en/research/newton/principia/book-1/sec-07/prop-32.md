The rectilinear ascent and descent of bodies,

## Problem 32 PROBLEM 24

Supposing that the centripetal force is reciprocally proportional to tht distance the square of places from the centre ; it is required to define the spaces which a body, falling directly, describes in given
the times.

### CASE 1

If the body does not fall perpendicularly, it will (by Cor. 1, Prop 13) describe some conic section whose focus is A
placed in the centre of force.
Suppose that conic sec
tion to be
A RPB
and
its
focus S.
And,
the

figure be an ellipsis, upon the greater axis thereof
describe the semi-circle ADB, and let the right line

pass through the falling body, making right angles
with the axis; and drawing DS, PS, the area ASD will c
be proportional to the area ASP, and therefore also to
