## Proposition 34 Theorem 10

If the shape BED is a parabola that the  velocity of a falling body in any place C is equal to the velocity by which a body may uniformly describe a circle around  centre B at half the interval BC

For (by Cor. 7, Prop. 16) the velocity of a
body describing a parabola RPB around the center S in any place P, is equal to the velocity of a body uniformly tracing a circle around the same centre S at half the interval SP. 

Let the breadth CP of the parabola be reduced infinitely so as the parabolic arc PfB may coincide with the line CB, the centre S with the vertex B, and the interval SP with the interval BC, and the proposition will be manifest.

## PROPOSITION 35 THEOREM 40

The area of the figure DES, described by the indefinite radius SD, is equal to the area which a body with a radius equal to half the latus rectum of the figure DES, by
uniformly revolving about the centre S, may describe in the same time

A body C in the smallest moment of time describes in falling the infinitely little line Cc. while another body K, uniformly revolving around the center S in the circle OKk, describes the arc Kk.
