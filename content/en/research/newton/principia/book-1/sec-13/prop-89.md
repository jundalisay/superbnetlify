the attracting bodies, preserving their common centre of gravity, should
unite there, and be formed into a globe.
And, therefore, if the common
centre of gravity of the attracting bodies be either at rest, or proceed uni
formly in a right line, the attracted body will move in an ellipsis having
Us centre in the common centre of gravity of the attracting
bodies.
