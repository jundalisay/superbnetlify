## PROPOSITION 47 THEOREM 15

Supposing the centripetal force to be proportional to t/ie distance of the
body from the centre ; all bodies revolving in any planes whatsoever
will describe ellipses, and complete their revolutions in equal times ;
and
those
which move in right
lines,
running backwards and forwards
going and returning
alternately will complete ttieir several periods of
in the same times.
,
For
letting all things stand as in the foregoing Proposition, the force
SV, with which the body Q, revolving in any plane PQ,R is attracted to
wards the centre S, is as the distance SO. and therefore because SV and
SQ,, TV and CQ, are proportional, the force TV with which the body is
;
attracted towards the given point C in the plane of the orbit is as the dis
tance CQ,.
Therefore the forces with which bodies found in the plane
PQ,R
are attracted towaitis the point O, are in proportion to the distances
with which the same bodies are attract-ed every way to
equal to the forces
wards the centre S
and in the same
;
and therefore the bodies will move in the same times,
figures, in
any plane
PQR
about the point C. n* they
would do

ai
in free spaces about the centre
S

and therefore (by Cor. 2, Prop.
2, Prop. XXXVIII.) they will in equal times either describe
that plane about the centre
C, or move to and fro in right lines
;

ellipses
passing through the centre C in that plane; completing the same periods
of time in all cases.

### SCHOLIUM

The rise and fall of bodies in curve superficies has a near relation motions we have been speaking of. 

Imagine curve lines to be de
to these
scribed on any plane, and to revolve about
any given axes passing through
the centre of force, and
and
by that revolution to describe curve
superficies
that the bodies
move
in
such sort that their centres
m
may
;
be always found
those superficies.
If those bodies
reciprocate to and fro with an oblique
ascent and descent, their motions will be
performed in planes passing through
tiie axis, and therefore in the curve
lines, by whose revolution those curve
were generated. In those cases, therefore,
consider thp motion in those curve lines.
