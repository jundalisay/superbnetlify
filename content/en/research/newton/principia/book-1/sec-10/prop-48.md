## PROPOSITION 48 THEOREM 16

If a wheel stands upon the outside of a globe at right angles thereto, and revolving about its own axis goes forward in a great circle, the length lite curvilinear path which any point, given in the perimeter of the
wheel, hath described, since, the time that it touched the globe (which
curvilinear path w~e may call the cycloid, or epicycloid), will be to double
of the versed sine of half the arc which since that time has touched the
globe in passing over it, as the sn,m of the diameters of the globe and
the wheel to the semi-diameter of the globe.


## PROPOSITION 49 THEOREM 17

If a wheel stand upon the inside of a concave globe at right angles there
to, and revolving about its own axis go forward in one of the great

given in the perimeter of the wheel^ hath described since it toncJied the

of the diameters of the globe and the wheel to the semi-diameter of the
