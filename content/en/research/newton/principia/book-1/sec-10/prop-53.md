## PROPOSITION 53 PROBLEM 35

Granting the quadratures of curvilinear figures, find the forces with which bodies moving in given curve can perform their oscillations in equal times.

Let the body T oscillate in any curve line STRQ,, whose axis is AR passing through the centre of force C.

Draw TX any place of the body T, and in that tangent
