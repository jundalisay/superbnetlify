## PROPOSITION 52 PROBLEM 34

Define the velocities of the pendulums in the several places, and the times in which both the entire oscillations, and the several parts of them are performed.

descent and subsequent ascent in that right line.
Whence there is given
both the time of the descent from any place to the centre, and the time equal

### Corollary 2

Hence also follow what Sir Christopher Wren and M. Huygevs

have discovered concerning the vulgar cycloid. For if the diameter of the
globe be infinitely increased, its sphacrical superficies will be changed into a
plane, and the centripetal force will act uniformly in the direction of lines
perpendicular to that plane, and this cycloid of our s will become the same

four times the versed sine of half the arc of the wheel between the same
plane and the describing point, as was discovered by Sir Christopher Wren.
