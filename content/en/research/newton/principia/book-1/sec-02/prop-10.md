## Proposition 10 Problem 5

If a body revolves in an ellipsis. It is proposed to find the law of the centripetal force tending to the centre of the ellipsis.

Suppose CA, CB to be semi-axes of the ellipsis. GP, DK conjugate diameters. PF, QT perpendiculars to those diameters. Qv an ordinate to the diameter GP. If the parallelogram QvPR be completed, then (by
the properties of the jonic sections) the rectangle
