## Proposition 1 Theorem 1

The areas, which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an immovable centre of force do lie in the same immovable planes, and are proportional to the times in which they are described.

The time to be divided into equal parts, and in the first part of that time let the body by its innate force describe the right line AB. 

In the second part of that time, the same would (by Law I.), if not hindered,
