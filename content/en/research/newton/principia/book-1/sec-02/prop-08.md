## Proposition 8 Problem 3

If a body moves in the semi-circumference PQA,find the law of the centripetal force tending to a point S, so remote that all the lines PS, RS drawn thereto may be taken for parallels.

### SCHOLIUM

A body will be moved in an ellipsis, or even ia
an hyperbola, or parabola, by a centripetal force which is reciprocally ae
the cube of the ordinate directed to an infinitely remote centre of force.


## Proposition 9 Problem 4

If a body revolves in a spiral PQS, cutting all the radii SP, SQ, etc., in a given angle; it is proposed to find the law of the centripetal force tending of that spiral.

Suppose the indefinitely small angle PSQ to be given because, then all the angles are given, the shape SPRQT will be given in specie.

Therefore the ratio ? is also given, and ? is as QT that is as SP. 

But if the angle PSQ is any way changed, the right line QR, subtending the angle of contact is (be
