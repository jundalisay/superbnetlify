## Proposition 2 Theorem 2

Every body that moves in any curve line described in a plane, and by a radius, drawn to a point either immovable, or moving forward with an uniform rectilinear motion, describes about that point areas proportional to the times, is urged by a centripetal force directed

### CASE 1

For every body that moves in a curve line, is (by Law 1) turned aside from
its rectilinear course by the action of some force that impels it. 

That force by which the body is turned off from its rectilinear course, and is made describe, in to
equal times, the equal least

the radii meet, towards the parts to which the motion tends.


## SCHOLIUM

A body may be urged by a centripetal force compounded of several forces. The resulting force  tends to the Point S. 

But if any force acts perpetually in the direction of lines perpendicular to the surface, this force will make the body to deviate from the plane of its motion. But it will neither augment nor diminish the quantity of the described surface and is therefore to be neglected in the composition of forces.
