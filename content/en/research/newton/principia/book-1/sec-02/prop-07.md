## PROBLEM 7 

The law of centripetal force directed to any given point in a body revolving in a circle

Let:

- VQPA be the circumference of the circle
- S is the given point which is the center where the force tends
- P is the body moving in the 
- Q is the next place into which it is to move
- PRZ is the tangent of the circle at the preceding place

Through point S, draw the chord PV, and the diameter VA of the circle. Join AP and draw QT perpendicular to SP which produced may meet the tangent in
