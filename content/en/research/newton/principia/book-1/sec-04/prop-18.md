## LEMMA 15

If from the two foci S, H, of any ellipsis or hyberbola, we draw to any third point V the right lines SV, HV, where one HV is equal to the principal axis of the shape (the axis in which the foci are situated, the other SV is bisected in T by the perpendicular TR that falls on it. That perpendicular TR will touch the conic section somwhere. Vice versa, if it does touch it, HV will be equal to the principal axis of the shape. 

Let the perpendicular TR cut the right line HV in R and then join SR. TS and TV are equal. Therefore the right lines SR and VR and the angles TRS, TRV, will also be equal.

Point R will be in the conic section, and the perpenpendicular TR will touch the same. 


## Proposition 18 PROBLEM 10

From a focus and the principal axes given, describe elliptic and hyperbolic trajectories, which shall pass through given points, and touch right lines given by position.

Let:
- S be the common focus of the shapes. 
- AB is the length of the principal axis of any trajectory
- P is a point through which the trajectory should pass
- TR is a right line which it should touch.

The center P has an interval AB-SP. If the orbit is an ellipsis, or AB-SP, if the orbit is an hyperbola, describe the circle
