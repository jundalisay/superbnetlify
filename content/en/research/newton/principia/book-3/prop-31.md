## Proposition 31 Problem 12

Find the horary motion of the nodes of the moon in an elliptic orbit

Let:
- Qjpmaq represent an ellipsis with the greater axis Qq, and the lesser axis ab QAqB a circle circumscribed
- T is the earth in the common centre of both
- S the sun
- p is the moon moving in this ellipsis 
- pm is an arc which it describes in the least moment of time
- N and n are the nodes joined by the line Nn 
- pK and mk are perpendiculars upon the axis Qq produced both ways till they meet the circle in P and M, and the line of the nodes in D and d

If the moon, by a radius drawn to the earth, describes an area proportional to the time of description, the horary motion of the node in the ellipsis will be as the area pDdm and AZ2 conjunctly.
