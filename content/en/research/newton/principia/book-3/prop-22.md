But there are yet other inequalities not observed by former astronomers, by which the motions of the moon are so disturbed, that to this day we
have not been able to bring them under any certain rule. For the veloc
ities or horary motions of the
apogee and nodes of the moon, and their
equations, as well as the difference betwixt the greatest eccentricity in the
syzygics, and the least eccentricity in the quadratures, and that inequality
which we call the variation, are (by Cor. 14, Prop. LXVI, Book

course of the year augmented and diminished in the triplicate proportion of the sun s apparent diameter.

By Cor. 1 and 2, Lem. 10, and Cor.
16, Prop. LXVI, Book I, the variation is augmented and diminished nearly in the duplicate proportion of the time between
the quadratures.

But in astronomical calculations, this is
commonly thrown inequality into and confounded with the equation of the moon's centre.

Thus, while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the quadratures, during which time the 3d hour of the sun precedes
the 3d hour of the moon, the greatest height of the waters will also precede
the 3d hour of the moon, and that, by the greatest interval, a little after

Farther, it may happen that the tide may be propagated from the ocean
through different channels towards the same port, and may pass quicker
through some channels than through others in which case the same tide,

divided into two or more succeeding one another, may compound new mo
tions of different kinds.
Let us suppose two equal tides flowing towards
the same port from different places, the one preceding the other by 6 hours
;
and suppose the first tide to happen at the third hour of the appulse of the
moon to the meridian of the port. If the moon at the time of the appulse
to the
meridian was in the equator, every 6 hours alternately there would
