## Proposition 33 Problem 14

Find the true motion of the moon's nodes

In the time which is as the area NTA-NdZ that motions is as the area NAe, and is thence given but because the calculus is too difficult, it will be better to use the following construction of the Problem.

Around the centre C, with any interval CD, describe the circle BEFD, produce DC to A so as AB may be to AC as the mean motion to half the mean true motion when

### SCHOLIUM

Astronomer Mr. Machin, Prof. Gresh, and Dr. Henry Pemberton, separately found the motion of the nodes by a different method.
