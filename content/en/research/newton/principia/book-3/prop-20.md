## Proposition 20 Problem 4

Find and compare the weights of bodies in the different regions of our earth

The weights of the unequal legs of the canal ACQqca are equal. The weights of the parts proportional to the whole legs and alike situated in them are one to another as the weights of the wholes, and therefore equal between themselves.

The weights of equal parts, and alike situated in the legs, will be reciprocally as the legs, that is, reciprocally as 230 to And 229.

The case is the same in all homogeneous equal bodies alike situated in the legs of the canal.

Their weights are reciprocally as the legs, that is, reciprocally as the distances of the bodies from the centre of the earth. 

Therefore if the bodies are situated in the uppermost parts of the canals, or on the surface of the earth, their weights will be one to another reciprocally as their distances from the centre.

The weights in other places round the whole surface of the earth are reciprocally as the distances of the places from the centre and, therefore, in the hypothesis of the earth s being a spheroid are given in proportion.

Whence arises this Theorem, that the increase of weight in passing from tne equator to the poles is nearly as the versed sine of double the latitude or, which comes to the same thinir, as the square of the right sine of the latitude and the arcs of the degrees of latitude in the meridian increase same proportion. 

Therefore, since the latitude of Paris nearly in the is 48 50 that of places under the equator 00 00 and that of places
and the versed sines of double those arcs are, under the poles 90
11334,00000 and 20000, the radius being 10000

The force of gravity at the pole is to the force of gravity at the equator as 230 to 229 and the excess of the force of gravity at the pole to the force of gravity at the
the excess of the force of gravity in the latitude of equator as 1 to 229

Paris will be to the force of gravity at the equator as 1 X Htll to 229, or as 5667 to 2290000.

Therefore the whole forces of gravity in those places will be one to the other as 2295667 to 2290000.

Wherefore since the lengths of pendulums vibrating in equal times are as the forces of gravity, and in the latitude of Paris, the length of a pendulum vibrating is 3 Paris feet, and S of lines, or rather because of the seconds weight lines, the length of a pendulum vibrating in the same time arider the equator will be shorter by 1,087 lines.

By a like calculus, the following table is made.

Dr. Halley in 1677 arrived at the island of St. Helena, found his pendulum clock to go slower there than at it London without marking the difference. 

But he shortened the rod of more than the \ of an inch, or l line and to effect this, be

In the following years, 1699, and 1700, M. des Hayes, making another to America, determined that in the island of Cayenne and Granada voyage
the length of the pendulum vibrating in seconds was a small matter less

In 1704, P. Feuille, at Puerto Bello in America, found that the length of the pendulum vibrating in seconds was 3 Paris feet, and only 5--^ lines, that is, almost 3 lines shorter than at Paris ; but the

the excesses of the length of the pendulum at Paris above the lengths of
the isochronal pendulums observed in those latitudes are a little
greater than by the table of the lengths of the pendulum before computed. 

And is a little higher under the equator than by the preceding calculus, and a little denser at the centre than in mines near the surface, unless, perhaps,
the heats of the torrid zone have a little extended the length of the pendulums.

Mr. Picart observed, that a rod of iron, which in frosty weather was one foot long, when heated by lire, was lengthened
into one foot and line.

Afterward Mr. de la Hire found that a rod of in which the like winter season was 6 feet long, when exposed to the iron, in the winter season summer heat of the case the heat

In the former sun, was extended into 6 feet and f line.

in the latter but in the latter it was greater was greater than

than the heat of the external parts of a human body for metals exposed to the summer sun acquire a very considerable degree of heat. 

But the rod of a pendulum clock is never exposed to the heat of the summer sun, nor ever acquires a heat equal to that of the external parts of a human body and, therefore, though the 3 feet rod of a pendulum clock will indeed be a

little longer in the amount summer than
in the winter season, yet the difference will 

Therefore the total difference of the lengths of scarcely isochronal pendulums in different climates cannot be ascribed to the difference of heat nor indeed to the mistakes of the French astronomers.

Although there is not a perfect agreement between their observations, yet and in this they all the errors are so small that they may be neglected agree, that isochronal pendulums are shorter under the equator than

at the Royal Observatory of Paris, by a difference not less than 1{ line,
nor greater than 2| lines.

By the less accurate observations of others, the same was made about two

this disagreement might arise partly from the errors of the observations, partly
from the dissimilitude of the internal parts of the earth, and the height of
mountains partly from the different heats of the air.

I take an iron rod of 3 feet long to be shorter by a sixth part of one line

in winter time with us here in England than
in the summer.

Because of the great heats under the equator, subduct this quantity from the difference of one line and a quarter observed by M. Richer, and there will remain one line T V, which agrees very well with l T -oo ^ ne collected, by the theory a M.

If this gentleman s
observations are to be depended on, the earth is higher under the
equator than at the
poles, and that by an excess of about 17 miles; as appeared above by the
theory.
