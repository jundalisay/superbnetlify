Book 1 laid down the principles of mathematical philosophy. This will be the basis of our reasonings on philosophical inquiries.

These mathematical principles are the laws and conditions of certain motions and forces. I use them to build a system of the universe.

To prevent them from being dry and barren, I have illustrated them here with some philosophical scholiums, such as:
- the density and the resistance of bodies
- spaces void of all bodies and
- the motion of light and sounds. 

I explain the principles as propositions. Readers should go through Books 1 and 2 first, specifically:
- the definitions
- laws of motion
- sections 1-3 of Book 1



## Rules Of Reasoning

### Rule 1: We only need to look for the causes of natural phenomena that are enough to explain their appearances.  

Nature is pleased with simpicity.

### Rule 2: The same natural effects come from the same natural causes

- Respiration is the same for humans and animals
- The light of our stove fire is the same as the light of the sun 




### Rule 3(!*): Universal qualities are those which are common to all the bodies which we experiment with 

The qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments. We deem universal all those qualities that universally agree with experiments. <!--  nnd such as are not liable to diminution can never be quite taken away. -->

We will not relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of vain fictions. <!--  of our own devising nor are we to recede from
the analogy of Nature, which uses to be simple, and always consonant to
;
itself. -->

We can only know bodies than by our senses..

bodies are hard, we learn by experience and because

the hardness of the whole arises from the hardness of the parts, we therefore

all others.

penetrable, and thence conclude impenetrability to be an universal property
That all bodies are rnoveable, and endowed with

tion, or in their rest, we only infer from the like properties observed in the
of all bodies whatsoever.

we have seen. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mo
and vis inertia of the whole, result from the extension, hardness,
impenetrability, mobility, and vires inertia of the parts; and thence we

conclude the least particles of all bodies to be also all extended, and hard
and impenetrable, and moveable, and endowed with their proper vires inertia.
And this is the foundation of all philosophy. Moreover, that the divided
but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one another, is
matter of observation and, in the particles that remain undivided, our
minds are able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically demon
But whether the parts so distinguished, and not yet divided, may,

by the powers of Nature, be actually divided and separated from one an
other, we cannot certainly determine.
Yet, had we the proof of but one
experiment that any undivided particle, in breaking a hard and solid body,
suffered a division, we might by virtue of this rule conclude that the un
divided as well as the divided particles may be divided and actually sep
;
arated to infinity.
Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical obser
vations, that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the earth, and
that in proportion to the quantity of matter which they severally contain
that the moon likewise, according to the quantity of its matter, gravitates
towards the earth that, on the other hand, our sea gravitates towards the

and
the planets mutually one towards another and the comets

This is immutable.

Their gravity is diminished as they recede from the earth. -->


> *Superphysics Note: Newton bases perception-effects on the immediate senses. This leads to causes which are limited to the 3 layers instead of all 5 layers since 2 of the upper layers are sensed by feelings instead of the eyes.




### Rule 4*: Induction from Phenomena over Imaginary Hypothesis

Our experiments<!--  philosophy -->, must be based on propositions collected by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, despite any contrary imaginary hypotheses, until these are corrected by <!--  till such time as --> other phenomena. <!--  occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions. --> <!-- This rule we must follow, that --> The argument of induction cannot evaded by hypotheses.


> *Superhysics Note: Superphysics improves Physics-inductions by getting the general inductions from the feelings noted throughout history which may have escaped most people who have a limited view. These are then put into experiments to create new principles. We use data science instead of math to improve the quality of inductions, as well as aid in the expriments, since the brain can only process a limited data set
