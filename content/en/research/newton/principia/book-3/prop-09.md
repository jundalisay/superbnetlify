### Proposition 9 Theorem 9

Gravity, as a downward pull of a planet, decreases nearly in the proportion of the distances from their centres. 

If the matter of the planet were of an uniform density, this Proposition would be accurately true (by Prop. LXXIII. Book I).

The error no greater than what therefore, can be
may arise from the inequality of the density.


### Proposition 10 Theorem 10

It is shewn in the Scholium of Prop. XXII, Book II, that at the height

ficies of the earth in the ratio of 30 to 0,0000000000003999, or as
is 75000000000000 to 1 nearly. And hence the planet Jupiter, revolving in
a medium of the same density with that superior air, would not lose by the

the lightest down, let fall together, will descend with equal velocity; and
though they fall through a space of four, six, and eight feet, they will come

And therefore the celestial regions being perfectly void of air and exhalations, the
planets and comets meeting no sensible resistance in those spaces will con

### Proposition 11 Theorem 11

The common centre of gravity of the earth, the sun, and all the planets are immovable.

Corollary 4 of the Laws shows that centre is  either:
- at rest, or 
- moves uniformly forward

But if that centre moved, the centre of the world would move also, against the Hypothesis.


### Proposition 12 Theorem 12

The sun is agitated by a perpetual motion, but never recedes far from the common, centre of gravity of all the planets

By Cor. 2, Prop. 8, the quantity of matter in the sun is to the quantity of matter in Jupiter as 1067 = 1.

Based on the distance of Jupiter from the sun, the common center of Jupiter and the sun is at a point a little outside the sun's surface.

The quantity of matter in the sun is to the quantity of matter in Saturn as 3021 = 1.

Based on the distance of Saturn from the sun, the common center of Saturn and the sun is at a point a little within the sun's surface.

We extend this to all the planets to find that their common centre of gravity would be within 1 diameter of the sun.

therefore, since that centre of gravity is in perpetual rest, the sun, accord

Hence the common centre of gravity of the earth, the sun, and all the planets, is the centre of the universe. This is because the sun, and all the planets, mutually gravitate one towards another, and are therefore, according to their powers of gravity, in perpetual agitation, as the Laws of Motion require, it is plain that their moveable centres can not be taken for the immovable centre of the world.

If that body were to be placed in the centre, towards which other bodies gravitate most, that privilege ought to be allowed to the sun; but since the sun itself is moved, a fixed point is to be chosen from which the be placed centre and from which it would recede yet least, and greater, and therefore less apt denser of the were sun body sun recedes
