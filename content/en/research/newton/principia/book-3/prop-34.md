## Proposition 34 Problem 15

Find the horary variation of the inclination of the moon's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic.

Let:

- A and a are syzygies
- Q and q are the quadratures
- N and n are the nodes
- P is the place of the moon in its orbit
- p is the orthographic projection of that place upon the plane of the ecliptic
- mTl is the momentaneous motion of the nodes as above. 

If upon Tm we let fall the perpendicular PG and joining pG we produce it till it meet Tl in g, and also join Pg, the angle PGp will be the inclination of the moon s orbit to the plane of the ecliptic when the moon is in P
and the angle Pgp will be the inclination of the same after a small moment of time is elapsed;

Therefore the angle GPg- will be the momentaneous variation of the

But this angle GPg- is to the angle GTg as TG to PG and
