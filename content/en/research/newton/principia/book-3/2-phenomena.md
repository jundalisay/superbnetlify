The circumjovial planets, by radii drawn to Jupiter s centre, describe areas proportional to the times of description.  

Their periodic times, with the fixed stars at rest, are in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from its centre.

Astronomical observations prove this. The orbits of these planets differ but insensibly from circles concentric to Jupiter. Their motions in those circles are uniform.

All astronomers agree that their periodic times are in the sesquiplicate proportion of the semi-diameters of their orbits:

## PHENOMENON 4

With the fixed stars at rest, the periodic times of the five primary planets, and (whether of the suit about the earth, or) of the earth about the sun, are in the sesquiplicate proportion of their mean distances from the sun.

This proportion was first observed by Kepler. All astronomers agree:
- that the periodic times are the same
- the dimensions of the orbits are the same, whether the sun revolves about the earth, or the earth about the sun.
- on the measures of the periodic times

But for the dimensions of the orbits, Kepler and Bullialdns, above all others, have determined them from observations with the and the mean distances corresponding to the periodic times differ but insensibly from those which they have assigned, and for the most part fall in between them as we may see from the following table.

## PHENOMENON 5

The primary planets, by radii drawn to the earth, describe areas no to the times ; but that the areas which they describe wise proportional by radii drawn to  the snn are proportional  to the times described.

For to the earth they appear sometimes direct, sometimes stationary,

But from the sun they are always seen nay, and sometimes retrograde. direct, and to proceed with a motion nearly uniform, that is to say, a little swifter in the perihelion and a little slower in the aphelion distances, so as
to maintain an equality in the description of the areas.

This a noted proposition among astronomers, and particularly demonstrable in Jupiter,
from the eclipses of his satellites; by the help of which eclipses, as we have
said, the heliocentric longitudes of that planet, and its distances from the
sun, are determined.

## PHENOMENON 6

The moon, by a radius drawn to the earths centre, describes an area proportional to the time of description.

This we gather from the apparent motion of the moon, compared with its apparent diameter.

It is true that the motion of the moon is a little disturbed by the action of the sun but in laying down these Phenomena I neglect those imall and inconsiderable errors.
