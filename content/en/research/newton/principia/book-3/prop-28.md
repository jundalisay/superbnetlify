## Proposition 28 Problem 9

Find the diameters of the orbit, in which, without eccentricity, the moon would move.

The curvature of a body's orbit is:
- directly proportional to the force of attraction 
- inveresely proportional to the square of the velocity

The curvatures of lines compared with one another according to the evanescent proportion of the sines or tangents of their angles of contact to equal radii, supposing those radii to be infinitely diminished.

But the attraction of the moon towards the earth in the syzygies the excess of its gravity towards the earth above the force of the sun 2PK (Prop 25) by which force the accelerative gravity of the Earth towards the sun, or is exceeded by it.

But in the quadratures that attraction is the sum of the gravity of the moon towards the earth, 


by which the moon is attracted towards the earth.

there will remain 2000, the force by which the moon in the syzygies is
drawn from the earth, and which we above called 2 PIC. But the velocity

Because the figure of the moon s orbit is unknown, let us, in its stead,
assume the ellipsis DBCA, in the centre of which we suppose the earth to
DC to lie between the quadratures as the
between the syzygies. But since the plane of this ellipsis is re-
rolved about the earth by an angular motion, and the orbit, whose curva
be situated, and the greater axis

we now examine, should be
described in a plane void of such motion we are to consider the figure which the moon,
