## Proposition 26 Problem 7

Find the horary increment of the area which the moon, by a radius drawn to the earth, describes in a circular orbit.

### Corollary 1

The apparent diameter of the moon is given for it is reciprocally as the distance of the moon from the earth.

Let astronomers

accurately this rule agrees with the phenomena.
Hence also the orbit of the moon may be more exactly defined
from the phaenomena than hitherto could be done.
