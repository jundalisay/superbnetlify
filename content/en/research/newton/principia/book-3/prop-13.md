### Proposition 13 Theorem 13

The planets move in ellipses which have their common focus in the sun's centre. By radii drawn, to tJtat centre, they describe areas pro the times of description.

The weights of the planets towards the sun are reciprocally as the squares of their distance from the sun s centre, if the sun was at rest, and the other planets did not mutually act one upon another, their orbits would be ellipses,
having common focus

They would describe areas proportional to the times of description, by Prop. I and XI, and Cor. 1, Prop. XIII, Book I. But the mutual actions of the planets one upon another are so the sun in their and by Prop. LXVI, Book I, they very small, that they may be neglected disturb the motions of the planets around the sun in motion than if less those motions were performed about the sun at rest.

### Proposition 14 Theorem 14

The aphelions and nodes of the orbits of the planets are fixed.

The aphelions and the planes of the orbits are immovable (Prop. 11 Book 1).  If the planes are fixed, then the nodes must be fixed too. 

Some inequalities may arise from the mutual actions of the planets and comets in their revolutions. But these will be so small, that they be here passed by.

Corollary 1= The fixed stars are immovable since they keep the same position to the aphelions and nodes of theh planets

Corollary 2= These stars are liable to no sensible parallax from the annual motion of the earth. Thus, they can have no force, because of their immense distance, to produce any sensible effect in our system. 

The stars are promiscuously dispersed in the heavens. Their contrary attractions destroy their mutual actions by Proposition 70 Book 1. 


### SCHOLIUM

Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars are so small that they can act with but little force on each other. Therefore their aphelions and nodes must be fixed, except as they are disturbed by the actions of Jupiter and Saturn, and other higher planets. 

Thus, their aphelions move a little in consequece, with respect of the fixed stars in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from the sun.

This in 100 years, the aphelions will be carried:
- Mars by 33'20"
- Earth by 17'40"
- Venus by 10'53"
- Mercury by 4'16"


## Proposition 15 Problem 1

Find the principal diameters of the orbits of the planets.

They are in the sub-sesquiplicate proportion of the periodic times, by Prop. 15, Book 1. Then they are augmented in the
proportion of the sum of the masses of matter in the sun and each planet to the first of two mean proportionals betwixt that sum and the quantity of matter in the sun, by Prop. 60, Book 1.


## Proposition 16 Problem 2 

Find the eccentricities and aphelions of planets 

This Problem is resolved by Proposition 18, Book 1. 


## Proposition 17 Theorem 15

The rotations of the planets are uniform. The libration of the moon is caused by its rotation. 

This is proven by the First Law of Motion, and Cor. 22, Prop 66 Book 1.

- Jupiter, with respect to the fixed stars, rotates in 9h 56m
- Mars in 24h 39m
- Venus in 23h
- Earth in 23h 56m
- Sun in 25.5 days
- The moon in 27 days 7h 43m

The sun's spots return in 27.5 days relative to the Earth. Relative to the stars, it rotates in 25.5 days.
