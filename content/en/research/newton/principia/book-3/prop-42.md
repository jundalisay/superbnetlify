Correct a comet's trajectory

### OPERATION 1 

Assume that position of the plane of the trajectory which was determined according to the preceding proposition

### Operation 2

Retaining the inclination of the plane of the trajectory to the
plane of the ecliptic, let the longitude of the nodes of the plane of the trajectory be increased by the addition of 20 or 30 minutes, which call P.

Then from the aforesaid three observed places of the comet let the three
true places be found (as before) in this
new plane;
as also the orbit passing
through those places, and the two areas of the same described between the
two observations, which call d and e ; and let t be the whole time in which
the whole area d + e should be described.
OrER. 3. Retaining the longitude of the nodes in the first operation, let
the inclination of the plane of the trajectory to the plane of the ecliptic be increased by adding thereto 20 or 30 , which call Q,.
Then from the aforesaid three observed apparent places of the comet let the three true places be found in this new plane, as well as the orbit passing through them, and the two areas of the same described between the observation,
and let r be the whole time in which the whole area
which call d and

The annual parallax of both these comets (this and the

This theory is likewise confirmed by the motion of that comet, which
in the year 1683 appeared retrograde, in an orbit whose plane contained
almost a right angle with the plane of the ecliptic, and whose ascending

to ex
pect that the same comet will return exactly in the same orbit, and in the
same periodic times it will be sufficient if we find the changes no greater
than may arise from the causes just spoken of.
:
And hense a reason may be assigned why comets are not comprehend-ed
within the limits of a zodiac, as the planets are; but, being confined to no
bounds, are with various motions dispersed all over the heavens; namely,
to this purpose, that in their aphelions,
where their motions are exceedingly
one from another, they may suffer less
disturbance from their mutual gravitations= and hence it is that the comets
slow, receding to greater distances
which descend the lowest, and therefore move the slowest in their aphelions,
ought also to ascend the highest.
The comet which appeared in the year 1GSO was in its perihelion less
distant from the sun than by a sixth part of the sun s diameter; and be
