## EXAMPLE

We propose a comet in the year 1680. This table shows its motion, as observed by Flamsted, and calculated and corrected by Dr. Halley.

stars amongst themselves, and collected their longitudes and

Now, in order to determine the orbit of the comet out of the observations above described, I selected those three which Flamsted made, Dec. 21, Jan. 5, and Jan. 25; from which I found S^ of 9842,1 parts, and V of 455

Lastly, in order to discover whether the comet did truly move in the orbit so determined, I

Moreover, Dr. Halley, observing that a remarkable comet had appeared four times at equal intervals of 575 years (that is, in the month of September after Julius Ccesar was killed An. Chr. 531, in the consulate of Lainpadins and Orestes; An. Chr. 1106, in the month of February. and at the end of the year 16SO; and that with a long and remarkable tail, except when it was seen after C(Bsai s death, at which time, by reason of the inconvenient, situation of the earth, the tail was not so conspicuous),
set himself to find out an elliptic orbit whose greater axis should be 1382957 parts, the mean distance of the earth from the sun containing 10000 such in which orbit a comet might revolve in 575 years and, placing the ascending node in 25 2 2 the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic in an angle of 61 6 48&quot;, the perihelion

Now one reflects upon the orbit described, and duly considers the other
