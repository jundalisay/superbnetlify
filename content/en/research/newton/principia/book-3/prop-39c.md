The comet of the year 1683 (by the observations of the same LJevelius),

appeared, moved at a very slow rate,

### Corollary 1 

Therefore the comets shine by the sun's light, which they reflect.

### Corollary 2

Comets are so frequently seen in that hemisphere where the sun is, and so seldom in the other.
