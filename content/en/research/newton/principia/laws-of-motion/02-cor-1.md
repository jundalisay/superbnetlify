## Corollary 1

{{< q >}}
A body that is moved by two perpendicular forces will move in a diagonal
{{< /q >}}


![Force on a plane](/graphics/physics/mnabcd.png)

- A force `M` impressed on a body at A will be uniformly carried from `A` to `B`. 
- A force `N` impressed  at `A` will be carried from `A` to `C`. 
- If `N` and `M` act together, their forces will an the same time be carried in the diagonal from `A` to `D`.
  - Law 2 means that `N` will not at all change the velocity generated by `M` <!-- , , by which the body is carried towards the line BD. -->
  - The body therefore will arrive at the line BD in the same time, whether the force `N` be impressed or not. Therefore at the end of that time, it will be found somewhere in the line BD.
- Likewise, it will be found somewhere in the line CD at the end of the same time, if N were impressed.  Therefore, it will be in the point D where both lines meet. 
  - But Law 1 means that it will move from A to D. 


## Corollary 2

{{< quote >}}
Thus, a single force AD is made up of two forces AC and CD just as those two forces can arise from AD.
