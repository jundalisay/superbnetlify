description: "The uniform gravity of a body acts equally in equal particles of time on that body to create equal velocities"

Galileo discovered Law 1, 2, and Corollaries 1, 2 as bodies:
- falling in the duplicate ratio of the time [as seconds squared]
- moving in a parabola as projectiles

The uniform gravity of a body acts equally in equal particles of time on that body to create equal velocities. In the whole time, gravity impresses a whole force and generates a velocity proportional to that time.

The space traveled per time are proportional to the velocity and time together in a duplicate ratio of the times*. 


> *Superphysics note: This leads to a unity as meters-per-second-squared


When a body is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity impresses forces and removes its upward velocities proportional to the times. At the time at the highest point, all the upward velocities [in unity] are removed. 

If a body is projected in any direction, the resulting motion is compounded with the motion arising from its gravity. 

<!-- As if the body A by its
jection alone could describe in a given time the right line
AB, and with its motion of falling alone could describe in
motion of pio-
same time the altitude AC complete the paralello-
ABDC, and the body by that compounded motion
will at the end of the time be found in the
place D and
the curve line AED, which that body describes, will be a
parabola, to which the right line AB will be a tangent in
A and whose ordinate BD will be as the square of the line AB. On the
same Laws and Corollaries depend those things which have been demonstrated concerning the times of the vibration of pendulums, and are con firmed by the daily experiments of pendulum clocks.

By the same, together with the third Law, Sir Christ. Wren, Dr. Wallis, and Mr. Huygens, the greatest geometers of our times, did severally determine the rules 
of the congress and reflexion of hard bodies, and much about the same time communicated their discoveries to the Royal Society, exactly agreeing among themselves as to those rules. 

Dr. Wallis was more early in the publication then followed Sir Christopher Wren, and,

Sir Christopher Wren confirmed the truth of the thing before the Royal Society by the experiment of pendulums, which Mr. Mariottc soon after thought fit to explain in a treatise entirely upon

Thus trying the thing with pendulums of ten feet, in unequal

through large spaces, as of 8, 12, or 16 feet, I found always, without an
error of 3 inches, that
when
the bodies concurred together directly, equal
changes towards the contrary parts were produced in their motions, and,
of consequence, that the action and reaction were always equal.
As if the

receded with 8 to wit, with a deduction of 14 parts of motion on
each side.
For from the motion of A subducting twelve parts, nothing
will remain
but subducting 2 parts more, a motion will be generated of
2 parts towards the contrary way and so, from the motion of the body

But if the bodies were made both to move towards the

and after reflexion A went on with 5, B likewise went on with 14 parts
9 parts being transferred from A to B. And so in other cases. By the
congress and collision of bodies, the quantity of motion, collected from the
sum of the motions directed towards the same way, or from the difference,
of those that were directed towards contrary ways, was never changed.
For the error of an inch or two in measures may be easily ascribed to tht

And as those bodies are equipollent in the congress and reflexion, whose velocities are reciprocally as their innate forces, so in the use of mechanic
instruments those agents are equipollent, and mutually sustain each the contrary pressure of the other, whose velocities, estimated according to the determination of the forces, are reciprocally as the forces.

So those weights are of equal force to move the arms of a balance;
