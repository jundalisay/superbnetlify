Krishna.

Whoever serve Me--as I show Myself-- Constantly true, in full devotion fixed,
Those hold I very holy. But who serve--
Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible,
The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable,
Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure--
Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense,
Of one set mind to all, glad in all good,
These blessed souls come unto Me.

Yet, hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach th' Unmanifest. That viewless path sShall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! 

But whereso any doeth all his deeds Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed
To serve only the Highest, night and day Musing on Me--him will I swiftly lift
Forth from life's ocean of distress and death, Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!

Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell surely with Me on high. But if thy thought
Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set Body and soul upon Me constantly,
Despair not! Give Me lower service! 

Seek To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;

If thou canst not worship steadfastly, work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!
For he that laboureth right for love of Me shall finally attain! 

But, if in this your faint heart fails, bring Me your failure. Find refuge in Me and let fruits of labour go.

Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart, so you shall come. 

To know is more than diligence, yet worship better is than knowing, and renouncing better still.

Very near to renunciation dwells Eternal Peace. 

Who hateth nought
Of all which lives, living himself benign,
compassionate, from arrogance exempt,
Exempt from love of self, unchangeable
By good or ill; patient, contented, firm
In faith, mastering himself, true to his word,
Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,--

I love such a person who:
- does not troubles others nor is troubled by them. 
- is clear of wrath
- living above gladness, grief, or fear
- dwells quiet-eyed,[FN#25] stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,
- works with Me, yet detached from all works
- fixed in faith on Me
- dotes upon none
- scorns none
- rejoices not,
- grieves not
- letting good or evil happen
- letting in Light when it will, and let it will depart
- keeps an equal heart to friend and foe
- with equal mind bears shame and glory
- with an equal peace takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain
- quit of desires,
- hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint unmoved by each
- linked by no ties to earth
- steadfast in Me

But most of all I love those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live
In single fervid faith and love unseeing/
