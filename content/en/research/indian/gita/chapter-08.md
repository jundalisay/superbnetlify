Who is that Brahma? 

What that Soul of Souls, the ADHYATMAN? 

What is work, the KARMA? 

What is what you call the ADHIBHUTA? 

What is ADHIDAIVA?

How can ADHIYAJNA be in your flesh?

How can good men find you in the hour of death?
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
I am BRAHMA, the One Eternal GOD.

ADHYATMAN is My Being's name, the Soul of Souls.

What goes forth from Me is called KARMA. It causes all life to live

I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives, manifested in divided forms.

I am ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods, because I am PURUSHA, who begets.

I am ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice--speaking with thee in this body here--Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines
Flame unto Me!) 

At the hour of death, he who has meditated on Me alone and put off his flesh, comes forth to Me and enters into My Being. Do not doubt!

But, if he meditated otherwise at hour of death, in putting off the flesh, he goes to what he looked for.

This is because the Soul is fashioned to its like.

So have Me in your heart always, and fight!

{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,
Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave
With never-wavering will of firmest faith,
Owning none other Gods: all come to Me,
The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!
Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,
Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,
Boundless,--but unto every atom Bringer
Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say,
Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;
Seen my effulgence--which no eye hath seen--
Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing,
Dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been
Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending,
With mind set fast and trustful piety,
Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,
In happy peace that faithful one doth die,--
In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.
The place which they who read the Vedas name
AKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven
Saints and ascetics--their road is the same.
That way--the highest way--goes he who shuts
The gates of all his senses, locks desire
Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs
Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set;
And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable--
Emblem of BRAHM--dies, meditating Me.
For who, none other Gods regarding, looks
Ever to Me, easily am I gained
By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,
They fall not--those Mahatmas--back to birth,
To life, which is the place of pain, which ends,
But take the way of utmost blessedness.
The worlds, Arjuna!--even Brahma's world--
Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest;
But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,
Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day
Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know
The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,
Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know!
When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible
Is brought anew into the Visible;
When that deep Night doth darken, all which is
Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth;
Yea! this vast company of living things--
Again and yet again produced--expires
At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,
Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.
But--higher, deeper, innermost--abides
Another Life, not like the life of sense,
Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures
When all created things have passed away:
This is that Life named the Unmanifest,
The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.
Thither arriving none return. That Life
Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith
Which wanders not, there is a way to come
Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread
The Universe around me--in Whom dwell
All living Things--may so be reached and seen!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . [FN#14]

Richer than holy fruit on Vedas growing, Greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast,
Such wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing, Comes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.
