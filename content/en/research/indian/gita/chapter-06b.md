{{< r a="Arjuna" >}}
Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog, This Peace, derived from equanimity,
Made known by thee--I see no fixity Therein, no rest, because the heart of men
Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous, Wilful and strong. 

It were all one, I think, To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
<!-- Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard -->
Man's heart is wavering and hard to restrain.

Yet may it grow restrained by habit, wont of self-command. 

This Yog, Comes not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;

But he who will be master of himself
Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Arjuna" >}}
What path goeth he who, having faith,
Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back
From holiness, missing the perfect rule?
Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,
Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven
When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?

Fain would I hear thee answer me herein,
Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
He is not lost. 

Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,
Because no heart that holds one right desire
Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,
Desiring righteousness, cometh at death
Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there
Measureless years, and being born anew,
Beginneth life again in some fair home
Amid the mild and happy. 

It may chance he descend into a Yogin house on Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth
Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!

So hath he back again what heights of heart
He did achieve, and so he strives anew
To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!
For by the old desire he is drawn on
Unwittingly; and only to desire
The purity of Yog is to pass
Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.
But, being Yogi, striving strong and long,
Purged from transgressions, perfected by births
Following on births, he plants his feet at last
Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks
Above ascetics, higher than the wise,
Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou
Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe,
Truest and best is he who worships Me
With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!
