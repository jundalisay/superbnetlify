This deathless Yoga, this deep union, I taught Vivaswata,[FN#6] the Lord of Light;
Vivaswata gave it to Manu who gave it to Ikshwaku. 

In time, the truth grew dim and perished.

I have reincarnated many times. 

Maya is my magic which I stamp on floating Nature-forms. 

I come, and go, and come. 

When Righteousness declines, I rise, from age to age, and take Visible shape, and move a man with men. I succour the good, thrust the evil back, and setting Virtue on her seat again.

<!-- Who knows the truth touching my births on earth -->

<!-- And my divine work, when he quits the flesh Puts on its load no more, falls no more down
To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!

Many there be who come!  -->

I come in many forms, all free from fear, anger, desire. They keep their hearts fixed on me.

<!-- --my Faithful--purified
By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these
Mix with my being. Whoso worship me,
Them I exalt; but all men everywhere
Shall fall into my path; albeit, -->

Those souls which seek reward for works, make sacrifices to the lower gods. They willl have their reward here. 

But I made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts. <!-- Yea, I
Created, the Reposeful; I that live
Immortally, made all those mortal births: -->

Works do not soil my essence, because I am uninvolved in them, just as the all those saints of old worked  unchained by action.

<!--  works
Wrought .[FN#7] Who knows me acting thus
, action binds not him;
And, so perceiving, 
Worked, seeking for deliverance.  -->

Work as those saints did.

Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before
By singers and by sages, "What is act,
And what inaction? "I will teach thee this,
And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save
Needs must one rightly meditate those three--
Doing,--not doing,--and undoing. 

Here Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees
How action may be rest, rest action--he
Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!
He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed
In all his works from prickings of desire,
Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth,

The wise call that man wise; and such an one,
Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.

Always self-satisfying, if he works,
Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,
Which--quit of fear and hope--subduing self--
Rejecting outward impulse--yielding up
To body's need nothing save body, dwells
Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm
Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved,
Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same
In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound

By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,
Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,
Whose heart is set on truth--of such an one
What work he does is work of sacrifice,
Which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar! All's then God!

- the sacrifice is Brahm
- the ghee and grain are Brahm
- the fire is Brahm
- the flesh it eats is Brahm
- unto Brahm attaineth he Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.

Some devotees serve the gods with flesh and altar-smoke. But others light subtler fires, make purer rite
with will of worship. 

Of the which be they
Who, in white flame of continence, consume
Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,
Forgoing tender speech and sound of song:

And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,

Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss Of youth and love, renouncing happiness:
And they who lay for offering there their wealth,
Their penance, meditation, piety, Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore
Painfully gained with long austerities:

There are those who make silent sacrifice by drawing in their breath to feed the flame of thought and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high.

Governing the ventage of each entering air
Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:
And they who, day by day denying needs,
Lay life itself upon the altar-flame,
Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep
The rite of offering, as if they slew
Victims; and all thereby efface much sin.
Yea! and who feed on the immortal food
Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,
To The Unending. But for him that makes
No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot

Even in the present world. How should he share
Another, O thou Glory of thy Line?
In sight of Brahma all these offerings
Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend
That all proceed by act; for knowing this,
Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice
Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts
Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth--O my Prince!
Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:
And these are gained by reverence, by strong search,
By humble heed of those who see the Truth
And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more
Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show
All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.
Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst
Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth
Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea
Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame
Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,
So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought

The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!
There is no purifier like thereto
In all this world, and he who seeketh it

Shall find it--being grown perfect--in himself.
Believing, he receives it when the soul
Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes--
Possessing knowledge--to the higher peace,
The uttermost repose. But those untaught,
And those without full faith, and those who fear
Are shent; no peace is here or other where,
No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.
He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,

Disparting self from service, soul from works,
Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince!

Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain
With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!
This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond
Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!
Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!
