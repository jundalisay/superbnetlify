hursday, December 14, 1882

IT WAS AFTERNOON. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed after a short noonday rest. Vijay, Balaram, M., and a few other devotees were sitting on the floor with their
faces toward the Master. They could see the sacred river Ganges through the door.


Since it was winter all were wrapped up in warm clothes. Vijay had been suffering from
colic and had brought some medicine with him.

## Vijay, the Brahmo preacher

Vijay was a paid preacher in the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, but there were many things about which he could not agree with the Samaj authorities. He came from a very noble
family of Bengal noted for its piety and other spiritual qualities. 

Advaita Goswami, one of his remote ancestors, had been an intimate companion of Sri Chaitanya. Thus the
blood of a great lover of God flowed in Vijay's veins. As an adherent of the Brahmo
Samaj, Vijay no doubt meditated on the formless Brahman; but his innate love of God,
inherited from his distinguished ancestors, had merely been waiting for the proper time
to manifest itself in all its sweetness. Thus Vijay was irresistibly attracted by the God-
intoxicated state of Sri Ramakrishna and often sought his company. He would listen to
the Master's words with great respect, and they would dance together in an ecstasy of
divine love.

It was a week-day. Generally devotees came to the Master in large numbers on
Sundays; hence those who wanted to have intimate talks with him visited him on week-
days.


## Tendencies from previous births

A boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide by cutting his
throat with a razor. The talk turned to him.

MASTER: "I felt very badly when I heard of the boy's passing away. He was a pupil in a
school and he used to come here. He would often say to me that he couldn't enjoy
worldly life. He had lived with some relatives in the western provinces and at that time
used to meditate in solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had
visions of many divine forms.
"Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his duties in his previous
birth. The little that had been left undone was perhaps finished in this one.
"One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous births. There is a
story about a man who practised the sava-sadhana.l He worshipped the Divine Mother in
180a deep forest. First he saw many terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed
him. Another man, happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed
a tree. Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship at hand. He
performed some purifying ceremonies and seated himself on the corpse. No sooner had
he done a little japa than the Divine Mother appeared before him and said: 'My child, I
am very much pleased with you. Accept a boon from Me.' He bowed low at the Lotus
Feet of the Goddess and said: 'May I ask You one question, Mother? I am speechless
with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so hard to get the ingredients
for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long time, but You didn't
condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who don't know anything of worship, who
have done nothing, who have neither devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven't
practised any austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.' The Divine Mother said
with a laugh: 'My child, you don't remember your previous births. For many births you
tried to propitiate Me through austerities. As a result of those austerities all these things
have come to hand, and you have been blessed with My Vision. Now ask Me your boon.'
"
Suicide after the vision of God
A DEVOTEE: "I am frightened to hear of the suicide."
MASTER: "Suicide is a heinous sin, undoubtedly. A man who kills himself must return
again and again to this world and suffer its agony.
"But I don't call it suicide if a person leaves his body after having the vision of God.
There is no harm in giving up one's body that way. After attaining Knowledge some
people give up their bodies. After the gold image has been cast in the clay mould, you
may either preserve the mould or break it.
"Many years ago a young man of about twenty used to come to the temple garden from
Baranagore; his name was Gopal Sen. In my presence he used to experience such
intense ecstasy that Hriday had to support him for fear he might fall to the ground and
break his limbs. That young man touched my feet one day and said: 'Sir, I shall not be
able to see you any more. Let me bid you good-bye.' A few days later I learnt that he
had given up his body.
Four classes of men
"It is said that there are four classes of human beings: the bound, those aspiring after
liberation, the liberated, and the ever-perfect.
Parable of the fish and the net
"This world is like a fishing-net. Men are the fish, and God, whose maya has created this
world, is the fisherman. When the fish are entangled in the net, some of them try to
tear through its meshes in order to get their liberation. They are like the men striving
after liberation. But by no means all of them escape. Only a few jump out of the net
with a loud splash, and then people say, 'Ah! There goes a big one!' In like manner,
three or four men attain liberation. Again, some fish are so careful by nature that they
are never caught in the net; some beings of the ever-perfect class, like Narada, are
181never entangled in the meshes of worldliness. Most of the fish are trapped; but they are
not conscious of the net and of their imminent death. No sooner are they entangled
than they run headlong, net and all, trying to hide themselves in the mud. They don't
make the least effort to get free. On the contrary, they go deeper and deeper into the
mud. These fish are like the bound men. They are still inside the net, but they think
they are quite safe there. A bound creature is immersed in worldliness, in 'woman and
gold', having gone deep into the mire of degradation. But still he believes he is quite
happy and secure. The liberated, and the seekers after liberation, look on the world as a
deep well. They do not enjoy it. Therefore, after the attainment of Knowledge, the
realization of God, some give up their bodies. But such a thing is rare indeed.
Worldly-minded forget their lessons
"The bound creatures, entangled in worldliness, will not come to their senses at all.
They suffer so much misery and agony, they face so many dangers, and yet they will not
wake up.
"The camel loves to eat thorny bushes. The more it eats the thorns, the more the blood
gushes from its mouth. Still it must eat thorny plants and will never give them up. The
man of worldly nature suffers so much sorrow and affliction, but he forgets it all in a few
days and begins his old life over again. Suppose a man has lost his wife or she has
turned unfaithful. Lo! He marries again.
"Or take the instance of a mother: her son dies and she suffers bitter grief; but after a
few days she forgets all about it. The mother, so overwhelmed with sorrow a few days
before, now attends to her toilet and puts on her jewelry. A father becomes bankrupt
through the marriage of his daughters, yet he goes on having children year after year.
People are ruined by litigation, yet they go to court all the same. There are men who
cannot feed the children they have, who cannot clothe them or provide decent shelter for
them; yet they have more children every year.
"Again, the worldly man is like a snake trying to swallow a mole. The snake can neither
swallow the mole nor give it up. The bound soul may have realized that there is no
substance to the world-that the world is like a hog plum, only stone and skin-but still he
cannot give it up and turn his mind to God.
"I once met a relative of Keshab Sen, fifty years old. He was playing cards. As if the
time had not yet come for him to think of God!
"There is another characteristic of the bound soul. If you remove him from his worldly
surroundings to a spiritual environment, he will pine away. The worm that grows in filth
feels very happy there. It thrives in filth. It will die if you put it in a pot of rice."
All remained silent.
Bondage removed by strong renunciation
VIJAY: "What must the bound soul's condition of mind be in order to achieve liberation?"
182MASTER: "He can free himself from attachment to 'woman and gold' if, by the grace of
God, he cultivates a spirit of strong renunciation. What is this strong renunciation? One
who has only a mild spirit of renunciation says, 'Well, all will happen in the course of
time; let me now simply repeat the name of God.' But a man possessed of a strong spirit
of renunciation feels restless for God, as the mother feels for her own child. A man of
strong renunciation seeks nothing but God. He regards the world as a deep well and
feels as if he were going to be drowned in it. He looks on his relatives as venomous
snakes; he wants to fly away from them. And he does go away. He never thinks, 'Let
me first make some arrangement for my family and then I shall think of God.' He has
great inward resolution.
Parable of the two farmers
"Let me tell you a story about strong renunciation. At one time there was a drought in a
certain part of the country. The farmers began to cut long channels to bring water to
their fields. One farmer was stubbornly determined. He took a vow that he would not
stop digging until the channel connected his field with the river. He set to work. The
time came for his bath, and his wife sent their daughter to him with oil. 'Father,' said
the girl, 'it is already late. Rub your body with oil and take your bath.' 'Go away!'
thundered the farmer. 'I have too much to do now.' It was past midday, and the farmer
was still at work in his field. He didn't even think of his bath. Then his wife came and
said: 'Why haven't you taken your bath? The food is getting cold. You overdo
everything. You can finish the rest tomorrow or even today after dinner.' The farmer
scolded her furiously and ran at her, spade in hand, crying: 'What? Have you no sense?
There's no rain. The crops are dying. What will the children eat? You'll all starve to
death. I have taken a vow not to think of bath and food today before I bring water to
my field.' The wife saw his state of mind and ran away in fear. Through a whole day's
back-breaking labour the farmer managed by evening to connect his field with the river.
Then he sat down and watched the water flowing into his field with a murmuring sound.
His mind was filled with peace and joy. He went home, called his wife, and said to her,
'Now give me some oil and prepare me a smoke.' With serene mind he finished his bath
and meal, and retired to bed, where he snored to his heart's content. The determination
he showed is an example of strong renunciation.
"Now, there was another farmer who was also digging a channel to bring water to his
field. His wife, too, came to the field and said to him: 'It's very late. Come home. It
isn't necessary to overdo things.' The farmer didn't protest much, but put aside his
spade and said to his wife, 'Well, I'll go home since you ask me to.' (All laugh) That man
never succeeded in irrigating his field. This is a case of mild renunciation.
"As without strong determination the farmer cannot bring water to his field, so also
without intense yearning a man cannot realize God. (To Vijay) Why don't you come here
now as frequently as before?"
VIJAY: "Sir, I wish to very much, but I am not free. I have accepted work in the Brahmo
Samaj."
183Attachment to "woman" creates bondage
MASTER: "It is 'woman and gold' that binds man and robs him of his freedom. It is
woman that creates the need for gold. For woman one man becomes the slave of
another, and so loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.
Story of Govindaji's priests
"The priests in the temple of Govindaji at Jaipur were celibates at first, and at that time
they had fiery natures. Once the King of Jaipur sent for them, but they didn't obey him.
They said to the messenger, 'Ask the king to come to see us.' After consultation, the
king and his ministers arranged marriages for them. From then on the king didn't have
to send for them. They would come to him of themselves and say: 'Your Majesty, we
have come with our blessings. Here are the sacred flowers of the temple. Deign to
accept them.' They came to the palace, for now they always wanted money for one thing
or another: the building of a house, the rice-taking ceremony of their babies, or the
rituals connected with the beginning of their children's education.
Story of twelve hundred nedas
"There is the story of the twelve hundred nedas and thirteen hundred nedis. Virabhadra,
the son of Nityananda Goswami, had thirteen hundred 'shaven-headed' disciples. They
attained great spiritual powers. That alarmed their teacher. 'My disciples have acquired
great spiritual powers', thought Virabhadra. 'Whatever they say to people will come to
pass. Wherever they go they may create alarming situations; for people offending them
unwittingly will come to grief.' Thinking thus, Virabhadra one day called them to him and
said, 'See me after performing your daily devotions on the bank of the Ganges.' These
disciples had such a high spiritual nature that, while meditating, they would go into
samādhi and be unaware of the river water flowing over their heads during the flood-
tide. Then the ebb-tide would come and still they would remain absorbed in meditation.
"Now, one hundred of these disciples had anticipated what their teacher would ask of
them. Lest they should have to disobey his injunctions, they had quickly disappeared
from the place before he summoned them. So they did not go to Virabhadra with the
others. The remaining twelve hundred disciples went to the teacher after finishing their
meditation. Virabhadra said to them: 'These thirteen hundred nuns will serve you. I ask
you to marry them.' 'As you please, revered sir', they said. 'But one hundred of us have
gone away.' Thenceforth each of these twelve hundred disciples had a wife.
Consequently they all lost their spiritual power. Their austerities did not have their
original fire. The company of woman robbed them of their spirituality because it
destroyed their freedom.
Degrading effect of serving others
(To Vijay) "You yourself perceive how far you have gone down by being a servant of
others. Again, one finds that people with many university degrees, scholars with their
vast English education, accept service under their English masters and are daily
trampled under their boots. The one cause of all this is woman. They have married and
set up a 'gay fair' with their wives and children. Now they cannot go back, much as they
would like to. Hence all these insults and humiliations, all this suffering from slavery.
184"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion, he is no longer attached to
woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder, he is free from fear of and
attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the other small.
Which one will attract the iron? The big one, of course. God is the big magnet.
Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can 'woman' do?"
Worshipping woman as Divine Mother
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, shall we hate women then?"
MASTER: "He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the eye of lust; so
he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so many aspects of the
Divine Mother. He worships them all as the Mother Herself.
(To Vijay) "Come here now and then. I like to see you very much."
VIJAY: "I have to do my various duties in the Brahmo Samaj; that is why I can't always
come here. But I shall visit you whenever I find it possible."
Difficulties of preaching
MASTER (to Vijay): "The task of a religious teacher is indeed difficult. One cannot teach
men without a direct command from God. People won't listen to you if you teach
without such authority. Such teaching has no force behind it. One must first of all attain
God through spiritual discipline or some other means. Thus armed with authority from
God, one can deliver lectures.
"After receiving the command from God, one can be a teacher and give lectures
anywhere. He who receives authority from God also receives power from Him. Only
then can he perform the difficult task of a teacher.
"An insignificant tenant was once engaged in a lawsuit with a big landlord. People
realized that there was a powerful man behind the tenant. Perhaps another big landlord
was directing the case from behind. Man is an insignificant creature. He cannot fulfil the
difficult task of a teacher without receiving power direct from God."
VIJAY: "Don't the teachings of the Brahmo Samaj bring men salvation?"
MASTER: "How is it ever possible for one man to liberate another from the bondage of
the world? God alone, the Creator of this world-bewitching maya, can save men from
maya. There is no other refuge but that great Teacher, Satchidananda. How is it ever
possible for men who have not realized God or received His command, and who are not
strengthened with divine strength, to save others from the prison-house of the world?
"One day as I was passing the Panchavati on my way to the pine-grove, I heard a
bullfrog croaking. I thought it must have been seized by a snake. After some time, as I
was coming back, I could still hear its terrified croaking. I looked to see what was the
matter, and found that a water-snake had seized it. The snake could neither swallow it
nor give it up. So there was no end to the frog's suffering. I thought that had it been
185seized by a cobra it would have been silenced after three croaks at the most. As it was
only a water-snake, both of them had to go through this agony. A man's ego is
destroyed after three croaks, as it were, if he gets into the clutches of a real teacher.
But if the teacher is an 'unripe' one, then both the teacher and the disciple undergo
endless suffering. The disciple cannot get rid either of his ego or of the shackles of the
world. If a disciple falls into the clutches of an incompetent teacher, he doesn't attain
liberation."
Ego alone the cause of bondage
VIJAY: "Sir, why are we bound like this? Why don't we see God?"
MASTER: "Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul. This egotism has
covered everything like a veil. 'All troubles come to an end when the ego dies.' If by the
grace of God a man but once realizes that he is not the doer, then he at once becomes a
Jivanmukta. Though living in the body, he is liberated. He has nothing else to fear.
"This maya, that is to say, the ego, is like a cloud. The sun cannot be seen on account
of a thin patch of cloud; when that disappears one sees the sun. If by the grace of the
guru one's ego vanishes, then one sees God.
"Rama, who is God Himself, was only two and a half cubits ahead of Lakshmana. But
Lakshmana couldn't see Him because Sita stood between them. Lakshmana may be
compared to the jiva, and Sita to maya. Man cannot see God on account of the barrier
of maya. Just look: I am creating a barrier in front of my face with this towel. Now you
can't see me, even though I am so near. Likewise, God is the nearest of all, but we
cannot see Him on account of this covering of maya.
Maya creates upadhis
"The jiva is nothing but the embodiment of Satchidananda. But since maya, or ego, has
created various upadhis, he has forgotten his real Self.
"Each upadhi changes man's nature. If he wears a fine black-bordered cloth, you will at
once find him humming Nidhu Babu's love-songs. Then playing-cards and a walking-
stick follow. If even a sickly man puts on high boots, he begins to whistle and climbs the
stairs like an Englishman, jumping from one step to another. If a man but holds a pen in
his hand, he scribbles on any paper he can get hold of-such is the power of the pen!
"Money is also a great upadhi. The possession of money makes such a difference in a
man! He is no longer the same person. A brahmin used to frequent the temple garden.
Outwardly he was very modest. One day I went to Konnagar with Hriday. No sooner did
we get off the boat than we noticed the brahmin seated on the bank of the Ganges. We
thought he had been enjoying the fresh air. Looking at us, he said: 'Hello there, priest!
How do you do?' I marked his tone and said to Hriday: 'The man must have got some
money. That's why he talks that way.' Hriday laughed.
186"A frog had a rupee, which he kept in his hole. One day an elephant was going over the
hole, and the frog, coming out in a fit of anger, raised his foot, as if to kick the elephant,
and said, 'How dare you walk over my head?' Such is the pride that money begets!
"One can get rid of the ego after the attainment of Knowledge. On attaining Knowledge
one goes into samādhi, and the ego disappears. But it is very difficult to obtain such
Knowledge.
Seven planes of the mind
"It is said in the Vedas that a man experiences samādhi when his mind ascends to the
seventh plane. The ego can disappear only when one goes into samādhi. Where does
the mind of a man ordinarily dwell? In the first three planes. These are at the organs of
evacuation and generation, and at the navel. Then the mind is immersed only in
worldliness, attached to 'woman and gold'. A man sees the light of God when his mind
dwells in the plane of the heart. He sees the light and exclaims: 'Ah! What is this? What
is this?' The next plane is at the throat. When the mind dwells there he likes to hear and
talk only of God. When the mind ascends to the next plane, in the forehead, between
the eyebrows, he sees the form of Satchidānanda and desires to touch and embrace It.
But he is unable to do so. It is like the light in a lantern, which you can see but cannot
touch. You feel as if you were touching the light, but in reality you are not. When the
mind reaches the seventh plane, then the ego vanishes completely and the man goes
into samādhi."
Indescribability of highest plane
VIJAY: "What does a man see when he attains the Knowledge of Brahman after reaching
the seventh plane?"
MASTER: "What happens when the mind reaches the seventh plane cannot be described.
"Once a boat enters the 'black waters' of the ocean, it does not return. Nobody knows
what happens to the boat after that. Therefore the boat cannot give us any information
about the ocean.
"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner did it enter the
water than it melted. Now who could tell how deep the ocean was? That which could
have told about its depth had melted. Reaching the seventh plane, the mind is
annihilated; man goes into samādhi. What he feels then cannot be described in words.
The "wicked I"
"The 'I' that makes one a worldly person and attaches one to 'woman and gold' is the
'wicked I'. The intervention of this ego creates the difference between jiva and Ātman.
Water appears to be divided into two parts if one puts a stick across it. But in reality
there is only one water. It appears as two on account of the stick. This 'I' is the stick.
Remove the stick and there remains only one water as before.
"Now, what is this 'wicked I'? It is the ego that says: 'What? Don't they know me? I have
so much money! Who is wealthier than I?' If a thief robs such a man of only ten rupees,
187first of all he wrings the money out of the thief, then he gives him a good beating. But
the matter doesn't end there: the thief is handed over to the police and is eventually
sent to jail. The 'wicked I' says: 'What? Doesn't the rogue know whom he has robbed?
To steal my ten rupees! How dare he?' "
VIJAY: "If without destroying the 'I' a man cannot get rid of attachment to the world and
consequently cannot experience samādhi, then it would be wise for him to follow the
path of Brahmajnāna to attain samādhi. If the 'I' persists in the path of devotion, then
one should rather choose the path of knowledge."
The "servant I"
MASTER: "It is true that one or two can get rid of the 'I' through samādhi; but these
cases are very rare. You may indulge in thousands of reasonings, but still the 'I' comes
back. You may cut the peepal-tree to the very root today, but you will notice a sprout
springing up tomorrow. Therefore if the 'I' must remain, let the rascal remain as the
'servant I'. As long as you live, you should say, 'O God, Thou art the Master and I am
Thy servant.' The 'I' that feels, 'I am the servant of God, I am His devotee' does not
injure one. Sweet things cause acidity of the stomach, no doubt, but sugar candy is an
exception.
"The path of knowledge is very difficult. One cannot obtain Knowledge unless one gets
rid of the feeling that one is the body. In the Kaliyuga the life of man is centred on
food. He cannot get rid of the feeling that he is the body and the ego. Therefore the
path of devotion is prescribed for this cycle.
This is an easy path. You will attain God if you sing His name and glories and pray to
Him with a longing heart. There is not the least doubt about it.
"Suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick. The water
appears to be divided into two parts; but the line doesn't remain for any length of time.
The 'servant I'or the 'devotee I' or the 'child I' is only a line drawn with the ego and is
not real".
The "ego of a devotee"
VIJAY (to the Master): "Sir, you ask us to renounce the 'wicked I'. Is there any harm in
the 'servant I'?"
MASTER: "The 'servant I'-that is, the feeling, 'I am the servant of God, I am the devotee
of God'-does not injure one. On the contrary, it helps one to realize God."
VIJAY: "Well, sir, what becomes of the lust, anger, and other passions of one who keeps
the 'servant I'?"
MASTER: "If a man truly feels like that, then he has only the semblance of lust, anger,
and the like. If, after attaining God, he looks on himself as the servant or the devotee of
God, then he cannot injure anyone. By touching the philosopher's stone a sword is
turned into gold. It keeps the appearance of a sword but cannot injure.
188"When the dry branch of a coconut palm drops to the ground, it leaves only a mark on
the trunk indicating that once there was a branch at that place. In like manner, he who
has attained God keeps only an appearance of ego; there remains in him only a
semblance of anger and lust. He becomes like a child. A child has no attachment to the
three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas. He becomes as quickly detached from a thing as
he becomes attached to it. You can cajole him out of a cloth worth five rupees with a
doll worth an ānnā , though at first he may say with great determination: 'No, I won't
give it to you. My daddy bought it for me.' Again, all persons are the same to a child.
He has no feeling of high and low in regard to persons. So he doesn't discriminate about
caste. If his mother tells him that a particular man should be regarded as an elder
brother, the child will eat from the same plate with him, though the man may belong to
the low caste of a blacksmith. The child doesn't know hate, or what is holy or unholy.
"Even after attaining samādhi, some retain the 'servant ego' or the 'devotee ego'.
bhakta keeps this 'I-consciousness'. He says, 'O God, Thou art the Master and I am
servant; Thou art the Lord and I am Thy devotee.' He feels that way even after
realization of God. His 'I' is not completely effaced. Again, by constantly practising
kind of 'I-consciousness', one ultimately attains God. This is called bhaktiyoga.
The
Thy
the
this
"One can attain the Knowledge of Brahman, too, by following the path of bhakti. God is
all-powerful. He may give His devotee Brahmajnāna also, if He so wills. But the devotee
generally doesn't seek the Knowledge of the Absolute. He would rather have the
consciousness that God is the Master and he the servant, or that God is the Divine
Mother and he the child."
VIJAY: "But those who discriminate according to the Vedanta philosophy also realize Him
in the end, don't they?"
Path of bhakti is easy
MASTER: "Yes, one may reach Him by following the path of discrimination too: that is
called Jnanayoga. But it is an extremely difficult path. I have told you already of the
seven planes of consciousness. On reaching the seventh plane the mind goes into
samādhi. If a man acquires the firm knowledge that Brahman alone is real and the
world illusory, then his mind merges in samādhi. But in the Kaliyuga the life of a man
depends entirely on food. How can he have the consciousness that Brahman alone is
real and the world illusory? In the Kaliyuga it is difficult to have the feeling, 'I am not the
body, I am not the mind, I am not the twenty-four cosmic principles; I am beyond
pleasure and pain, I am above disease and grief, old age and death.' However you may
reason and argue, the feeling that the body is identical with the soul will somehow crop
up from an unexpected quarter. You may cut a peepal-tree to the ground and think it is
dead to its very root, but the next morning you will find a new sprout shooting up from
the dead stump. One cannot get rid of this identification with the body; therefore the
path of bhakti is best for the people of the Kaliyuga. It is an easy path.
"And, 'I don't want to become sugar; I want to eat it.' I never feel like saying, 'I am
Brahman.' I say, 'Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant.' It is better to make the mind
189go up and down between the fifth and sixth planes, like a boat racing between two
points. I don't want to go beyond the sixth plane and keep my mind a long time in the
seventh. My desire is to sing the name and glories of God. It is very good to look on
God as the Master and oneself as His servant. Further, you see, people speak of the
waves as belonging to the Ganges; but no one says that the Ganges belongs to the
waves. The feeling, 'I am He', is not wholesome. A man who entertains such an idea,
while looking on his body as the Self, causes himself great harm. He cannot go forward
in spiritual life; he drags himself down. He deceives himself as well as others. He
cannot understand his own state of mind.
Prema-bhakti
"But it isn't any and every kind of bhakti that enables one to realize God. One cannot
realize God without prema-bhakti. Another name for prema-bhakti is raga-bhakti. God
cannot be realized without love and longing. Unless one has learnt to love God, one
cannot realize Him.
"There is another kind of bhakti, known as vaidhi-bhakti, according to which one must
repeat the name of God a fixed number of times, fast, make pilgrimages, worship God
with prescribed offerings, make so many sacrifices, and so forth and so on. By
continuing such practices a long time one gradually acquires raga-bhakti. God cannot be
realized until one has raga-bhakti. One must love God. In order to realize God one
must be completely free from worldliness and direct all of one's mind to Him.
"But some acquire raga-bhakti directly. It is innate in them. They have it from their
very childhood. Even at an early age they weep for God. An instance of such bhakti is
to be found in Prahlada. Vaidhi-bhakti is like moving a fan to make a breeze. One
needs the fan to make the breeze. Similarly, one practises japa, austerity, and fasting,
in order to acquire love of God. But the fan is set aside when the southern breeze blows
of
itself.
Such actions as japa and austerity drop away when one spontaneously feels love and
attachment for God. Who, indeed, will perform the ceremonies enjoined in the
scriptures, when mad with love of God?
"Devotion to God may be said to be 'green' so long as it doesn't grow into love of God;
but it becomes 'ripe' when it has grown into such love.
"A man with 'green' bhakti cannot assimilate spiritual talk and instruction; but one with
'ripe' bhakti can. The image that falls on a photographic plate covered with black film5
is retained. On the other hand, thousands of images may be reflected on a bare piece of
glass, but not one of them is retained. As the object moves away, the glass becomes
the same as it was before. One cannot assimilate spiritual instruction unless one has
already developed love of God."
VIJAY: "Is bhakti alone sufficient for the attainment of God, for His vision?"
190MASTER: "Yes, one can see God through bhakti alone. But it must be 'ripe' bhakti,
prema-bhakti and raga-bhakti. When one has that bhakti, one loves God even as the
mother loves the child, the child the mother, or the wife the husband.
"When one has such love and attachment for God, one doesn't feel the attraction of
maya to wife, children, relatives, and friends. One retains only compassion for them. To
such a man the world appears a strange land, a place where he has merely to perform
his duties. It is like a man's having his real home in the country, but coming to Calcutta
for work; he has to rent a house in Calcutta for the sake of his duties. When one
develops love of God, one completely gets rid of one's attachment to the world and
worldly wisdom.
"One cannot see God if one has even the slightest trace of worldliness. Match-sticks, if
damp, won't strike fire though you rub a thousand of them against the match-box. You
only waste a heap of sticks. The mind soaked in worldliness is such a damp match-
stick. Once Sri Radha said to her friends that she saw Krishna everywhere-both within
and without. The friends answered: 'Why, we don't see Him at all. Are you delirious?'
Radha said, 'Friends, paint your eyes with the collyrium of divine love, and then you will
see Him.'
(To Vijay) "It is said in a song of your Brahmo Samaj:
O Lord, is it ever possible to know Thee without love,
However much one may perform worship and sacrifice?
"If the devotee but once feels this attachment and ecstatic love for God, this mature
devotion and longing, then he sees God in both His aspects, with form and without
form."
Purity of heart
VIJAY: "How can one see God?"
MASTER: "One cannot see God without purity of heart. Through attachment to 'woman
and gold' the mind has become stained-covered with dirt, as it were. A magnet cannot
attract a needle if the needle is covered with mud. Wash away the mud and the magnet
will draw it. Likewise, the dirt of the mind can be washed away with the tears of our
eyes. This stain is removed if one sheds tears of repentance and says, 'O God, I shall
never again do such a thing.' Thereupon God, who is like the magnet, draws to Himself
the mind, which is like the needle. Then the devotee goes into samādhi and obtains the
vision of God.
God's grace is the ultimate help
"You may try thousands of times, but nothing can be achieved without God's grace. One
cannot see God without His grace. Is it an easy thing to receive the grace of God? One
must altogether renounce egotism; one cannot see God as long as one feels, 'I am the
doer.' Suppose, in a family, a man has taken charge of the store-room; then if someone
asks the master, 'Sir, will you yourself kindly give me something from the store-room?',
191the master says to him: 'There is already someone in the store-room. What can I do
there?'
"God doesn't easily appear in the heart of a man who feels himself to be his own
master. But God can be seen the moment His grace descends. He is the Sun of
Knowledge. One single ray of His has illumined the world with the light of knowledge.
That is how we are able to see one another and acquire varied knowledge. One can see
God only if He turns His light toward His own face.
"The police sergeant goes his rounds in the dark of night with a lantern6 in his hand. No
one sees his face; but with the help of that light the sergeant sees everybody's face, and
others, too, can see one another. If you want to see the sergeant, however, you must
pray to him: 'Sir, please turn the light on your own face. Let me see you.' In the same
way one must pray to God: 'O Lord, be gracious and turn the light of knowledge on
Thyself, that I may see Thy face.'
"A house without light indicates poverty. So one must light the lamp of Knowledge in
one's heart. As it is said in a song:
Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart,
Behold the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment."
As Vijay had brought medicine with him, the Master asked a devotee to give him some
water. He was indeed a fountain of infinite compassion. He had arranged for Vijay's
boat fare, since the latter was too poor to pay it. Vijay, Balaram, M., and the other
devotees left for Calcutta in a country boat.
Monday, January 1, 1883
At eight o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was seated on a mat spread on the floor
of his room at Dakshineswar. Since it was a cold day, he had wrapped his body in his
moleskin shawl. Prankrishna and M. were seated in front of him. Rakhal, too, was in
the room. Prankrishna was a high government official and lived in Calcutta. Since he
had had no offspring by his first wife, with her permission he had married a second
time. By the second wife he had a son. Because he was rather stout, the Master
addressed him now and then as "the fat brahmin". He had great respect for Sri
Ramakrishna. Though a householder, Prankrishna studied the Vedanta and had been
heard to say: "Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. I am He." The Master used
to say to him: "In the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends on food. The path of devotion
prescribed by Narada is best for this age."
A devotee had brought a basket of jilipi for the Master, which the latter kept by his side.
Eating a bit of the sweets, he said to Prankrishna with a smile: "You see, I chant the
name of the Divine Mother; so I get all these good things to eat. (Laughter.) But She
doesn't give such fruits as gourd or pumpkin. She bestows the fruit of Amrita,
Immortality-knowledge, love, discrimination, renunciation, and so forth."
192A boy six or seven years old entered the room. The Master himself became like a child.
He covered the contents of the basket with the palm or his hand, as a child does to
conceal sweets from another child lest the latter should snatch them. Then he put the
basket aside.
Suddenly the Master went into samādhi and sat thus a long time. His body was
transfixed, his eyes wide open and unwinking, his breathing hardly perceptible. After a
long time he drew a deep breath, indicating his return to the world of sense.
Vision of Divine Mother
MASTER (to Prankrishna): "My Divine Mother is not only formless, She has forms as
well. One can see Her forms. One can behold Her incomparable beauty through feeling
and love. The Mother reveals Herself to Her devotees in different forms.
"I saw Her yesterday. She was clad in a seamless ochre-coloured garment, and She
talked with me.
"She came to me another day as a Mussalman girl six or seven years old. She had a
tilak on her forehead and was naked. She walked with me, joking and frisking like a
child.
"At Hriday's house I had a vision of Gauranga. He wore a black-bordered cloth.
"Haladhāri used to say that God is beyond both Being and Non-being. I told the Mother
about it and asked Her, 'Then is the divine form an illusion?' The Divine Mother appeared
to me in the form of Rati's mother and said, 'Do thou remain in Bhāva ' I repeated this to
Haladhāri. Now and then I forget Her command and suffer. Once I broke my teeth
because I didn't remain in bhava. So I shall remain in bhava unless I receive a
revelation from heaven or have a direct experience to the contrary. I shall follow the
path of love. What do you say?"
PRANKRISHNA: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "But why should I ask you about it? There is Someone within me who does all
these things through me. At times I used to remain in a mood of Godhood and would
enjoy no peace of mind unless I was being worshipped.
"I am the machine and God is the Operator. I act as He makes me act. I speak as He
makes me speak. Keep your raft, says Ramprasad, afloat on the sea of life, Drifting up
with the flood-tide, drifting down with the ebb.
"It is like the cast-off leaf before a gale; sometimes it is blown to a good place and
sometimes into the gutter, according to the direction of the wind.
"As the weaver said in the story: 'The robbery was committed by the will of Rama, I was
arrested by the police by the will of Rama, and again, by the will of Rama, I was set
free.'
193"Hanuman once said to Rama: 'O Rama, I have taken refuge in Thee. Bless me that I
may have pure devotion to Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not be caught in the spell of
Thy world-bewitching maya.'
"Once a dying bullfrog said to Rama: 'O Rama, when caught by a snake I cry for Your
protection. But now I am about to die, struck by Your arrow. Hence I am silent.'
God's nature like that of a child
"I used to see God directly with these very eyes, just as I see you. Now I see divine
visions in trance.
"After realizing God a man becomes like a child. One acquires the nature of the object
one meditates upon. The nature of God is like that of a child. As a child builds up his
toy house and then breaks it down, so God acts while creating, preserving, and
destroying the universe. Further, as the child is not under the control of any guna, so
God is beyond the three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas. That is why paramahamsas
keep five or ten children with them, that they may assume their nature."
Sitting on the floor in the room was a young man from Agarpara about twenty-two years
old. Whenever he came to the temple garden, he would take the Master aside, by a
sign, and whisper his thoughts to him. He was a new-comer. That day he was sitting on
the floor near the Master.
MASTER (to the young man): "A man can change his nature by imitating another's
character. He can get rid of a passion like lust by assuming the feminine mood. He
gradually comes to act exactly like a woman. I have noticed that men who take female
parts in the theatre speak like women or brush their teeth like women while bathing.
Come again on a Tuesday or Saturday.
(To Prankrishna) "Brahman and Śakti are inseparable. Unless you accept Śakti, you will
find the whole universe unreal-'I', 'you', house, buildings, and family. The world stands
solid because the Primordial Energy stands behind it. If there is no supporting pole, no
framework can be made, and without the framework there can be no beautiful image of
Durga.
"Without giving up worldliness a man cannot awaken his spiritual consciousness, nor can
he realize God. He cannot but be a hypocrite as long as he has even a trace of worldly
desire. God cannot be realized without guilelessness.
Cherish love within your heart; abandon cunning and deceit:
Through service, worship, selflessness, does Rama's blessed
vision come.
Even those engaged in worldly activities, such as office work or business, should hold to
the truth. Truthfulness alone is the spiritual discipline in the Kaliyuga."
194PRANKRISHNA: "Yes, sir. It is said in the Mahanirvana Tantra: 'O Goddess, this religion
enjoins it upon one to be truthful, self-controlled, devoted to the welfare of others,
unagitated, and compassionate.'"
MASTER: "Yes. But these ideas must be assimilated."
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. He was in an ecstatic mood and looked
at Rakhal. Suddenly he was filled with the tender feeling of parental love toward his
young disciple and spiritual child. Presently he went into samādhi. The devotees sat
speechless, looking at the Master with wondering eyes.
Regaining partial consciousness, the Master said: "Why is my spiritual feeling kindled at
the sight of Rakhal? The more you advance toward God, the less you will see of His
glories and grandeur. The aspirant at first has a vision of the Goddess with ten arms;8
there is a great display of power in that image. The next vision is that of the Deity with
two arms; there are no longer ten arms holding various weapons and missiles. Then the
aspirant has a vision of Gopala, in which there is no trace of power. It is the form of a
tender child. Beyond that there are other visions also. The aspirant then sees only
Light.
"Reasoning and discrimination vanish after the attainment of God and communion with
Him in samādhi. How long does a man reason and discriminate? As long as he is
conscious of the manifold, as long as he is aware of the universe, of embodied beings, of
'I' and 'you'. He becomes silent when he is truly aware of Unity. This was the case with
Trailanga Swami.
"Have you watched a feast given to the brahmins? At first there is a great uproar. But
the noise lessens as their stomachs become more and more filled with food. When the
last course of curd and sweets is served, one hears only the sound 'soop, soop' as they
scoop up the curd in their hands. There is no other sound. Next is the stage of sleep-
samādhi. There is no more uproar.
(To M. and Prankrishna) "Many people talk of Brahmajnāna, but their minds are always
preoccupied with lower things: house, buildings, money, name, and sense pleasures. As
long as you stand at the foot of the Monument,10 so long do you see horses, carriages,
Englishmen, and Englishwomen. But when you climb to its top, you behold the sky and
the ocean stretching to infinity. Then you do not enjoy buildings, carriages, horses, or
men. They look like ants.
"All such things as attachment to the world and enthusiasm for 'woman and gold'
disappear after the attainment of the Knowledge of Brahman. Then comes the cessation
of all passions. When the log burns, it makes a crackling noise and one sees the flame.
But when the burning is over and only ash remains, then no more noise is heard. Thirst
disappears with the destruction of attachment. Finally comes peace.
195"The nearer you come to God, the more you feel peace. Peace, peace, peace-supreme
peace! The nearer you come to the Ganges, the more you feel its coolness. You will feel
completely soothed when you plunge into the river.
"But the universe and its created beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles, all exist
because God exists. Nothing remains if God is eliminated. The number increases if you
put many zeros after the figure one; but the zeros don't have any value if the one is not
there."
The Master continued: "There are some who come down, as it were, after attaining the
Knowledge of Brahman-after samādhi-and retain the 'ego of Knowledge' or the 'ego of
Devotion', just as there are people who, of their own sweet will, stay in the market-place
after the market breaks up. This was the case with sages like Narada. They kept the
'ego of Devotion' for the purpose of teaching men. Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of
Knowledge' for the same purpose.
"God cannot be realized if there is the slightest attachment to the things of the world. A
thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if the tiniest fibre sticks out.
"The anger and lust of a man who has realized God are only appearances. They are like
a burnt string. It looks like a string, but a mere puff blows it away.
"God is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment. Whatever appears
in the Pure Mind is the voice of God. That which is Pure Mind is also Pure Buddhi; that,
again, is Pure Ātman, because there is nothing pure but God. But in order to realize God
one must go beyond dharma and adharma."
The Master sang in his melodious voice:
Come, let us go for a walk, O mind, to Kāli, the Wish-fulfilling
Tree,
And there beneath It gather the four fruits of life. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna went out on the southeast verandah of his room and sat down.
Prankrishna and the other devotees accompanied him. Hazra, too, was sitting there.
The Master said to Prankrishna with a smile: "Hazra is not a man to be trifled with. If
one finds the big dargah here, then Hazra is the smaller dargah." All laughed at the
Master's words. A certain gentleman, Navakumar by name, came to the door and stood
there. At sight of the devotees he immediately left. "Oh! Egotism incarnate!" Sri
Ramakrishna remarked.
About half past nine in the morning Prankrishna took leave of the Master. Soon
afterwards a minstrel sang some devotional songs to the accompaniment of a stringed
instrument. The Master was listening to the songs when Kedār Chatterji, a householder
devotee, entered the room clad in his office clothes. He was a man of devotional
temperament and cherished the attitude of the gopis of Vrindāvan. Words about God
would make him weep.
196The sight of Kedār awakened in the Master's mind the episode of Vrindāvan in Sri
Krishna's life. Intoxicated with divine love, the Master stood up and sang, addressing
Kedār:
Tell me, friend, how far is the grove
Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells?
His fragrance reaches me even here;
But I am tired and can walk no farther. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna assumed the attitude of Sri Radha to Krishna and went into deep
samādhi while singing the song. He stood there, still as a picture on canvas, with tears
of divine joy running down his cheeks.
Kedār knelt before the Master. Touching his feet, he chanted a hymn:
We worship the Brahman-Consciousness in the Lotus of the
Heart,
The Undifferentiated, who is adored by Hari, Hara, and
Brahma;
Who is attained by yogis in the depths of their meditation;
The Scatterer of the fear of birth and death,
The Essence of Knowledge and Truth, the Primal Seed of the
world.
After a time the Master regained consciousness of the relative world. Soon Kedār took
his leave and returned to his office in Calcutta.
At midday Ramlal brought the Master a plate of food that had been offered in the Kāli
temple. Like a child he ate a little of everything.
Later in the afternoon several Marwari devotees entered the Master's room, where
Rakhal and M. also were seated.
A MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the way?"
Two ways of God-realization
MASTER: "There are two ways. One is the path of discrimination, the other is that of
love. Discrimination means to know the distinction between the Real and the unreal.
God alone is the real and permanent Substance; all else is illusory and impermanent.
The magician alone is real; his magic is illusory. This is discrimination.
"Discrimination and renunciation. Discrimination means to know the distinction between
the Real and the unreal. Renunciation means to have dispassion for the things of the
world. One cannot acquire them all of a sudden. They must be practised every day.
One should renounce 'woman and gold' mentally at first. Then, by the will of God, one
can renounce it both mentally and outwardly. It is impossible to ask the people of
Calcutta to renounce all for the sake of God. One has to tell them to renounce mentally.
197Constant practice urged
"Through the discipline of constant practice one is able to give up attachment to 'woman
and gold'. That is what the Gita says. By practice one acquires uncommon power of
mind. Then one doesn't find it difficult to subdue the sense-organs and to bring anger,
lust, and the like under control. Such a man behaves like a tortoise, which, once it has
tucked in its limbs, never puts them out. You cannot make the tortoise put its limbs out
again, though you chop it to pieces with an axe."
MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, you just mentioned two paths. What is the other
path?"
MASTER: "The path of bhakti, or zealous love of God. Weep for God in solitude, with a
restless soul, and ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Cry to your Mother Syama with a
real cry, O mind! And how can She hold Herself from you? "
MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the meaning of the worship of the Personal God? And
what is the meaning of God without form or attribute?"
MASTER: "As you recall your father by his photograph, so likewise the worship of the
image reveals in a flash the nature of Reality.
"Do you know what God with form is like? Like bubbles rising on an expanse of water,
various divine forms are seen to rise out of the Great Ākāśa of Consciousness. The
Incarnation of God is one of these forms. The Primal Energy sports, as it were, through
the activities of a Divine Incarnation.
"What is there in mere scholarship? God can be attained by crying to Him with a longing
heart. There is no need to know many things.
"He who is an Āchārya has to know different things. One needs a sword and shield to
kill others; but to kill oneself, a needle or a nail-knife suffices.
"One ultimately discovers God by trying to know who this 'I' is. Is this 'I' the flesh, the
bones, the blood, or the marrow? Is it the mind or the buddhi? Analysing thus, you
realize at last that you are none of these. This is called the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not
this, not this'. One can neither comprehend nor touch the Ātman. It is without qualities
or attributes.
"But, according to the path of devotion, God has attributes. To a devotee Krishna is
Spirit, His Abode is Spirit, and everything about Him is Spirit."
The Marwari devotees saluted the Master and took their leave.
At the approach of evening Sri Ramakrishna went out to look at the sacred river. The
lamp was lighted in his room. The Master chanted the hallowed name of the Divine
Mother and meditated on Her. Then the evening worship began in the various temples.
198The sound of gongs, floating on the air, mingled with the murmuring voice of the river.
Peace and blessedness reigned everywhere.
