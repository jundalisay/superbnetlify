<!-- Monday, June 30, 1884 -->


SRI RAMAKRISHNA was in his room at 4PM, sitting on a mat spread on the floor. 

Pundit Shashadhar and a few devotees were with him sitting on the mat.  

Surendra, Baburam, M., Harish, Lātu, Hazra, and others were present. 

He had met Pundit Shashadhar 6 days before in Calcutta. The latter, a follower of the path of jnāna, now came to visit the Master.

Bhudar Chattopadhyaya and his elder brother, the pundit's hosts, were with him.


## Nature of Brahman and Glories of Kāli


Ramakrishna (on jnana)

"Nityā and Lila are the 2 aspects of one and the same Reality. 

He who is the Indivisible Satchidananda has assumed different forms for the sake of His Lila." 

As he described the nature of the Ultimate Reality the Master every now and then became
unconscious in samādhi. While he talked he was intoxicated with spiritual fervour. 

He said to the pundit: "My dear sir, Brahman is immutalble and immovable, like Mount
Sumeru. But He who is 'immovable' can also 'move'."


The Master was in ecstasy. He began to sing in his melodious voice:

Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. . . .
He went on:
Is Mother merely a simple woman, born as others are born?
Only by chanting Her holy name
Does Śiva survive the deadly poison.
She it is who creates the worlds, She who preserves and
destroys,
With a mere wink of Her wondrous eyes;
She holds the universe in Her womb.
Seeking a shelter at Her feet, the gods themselves feel safe;
And Mahadeva, God of Gods,
Lies prostrate underneath Her feet.
Again he sang:
Is Mother only Śiva's wife? To Her must needs bow down
The all-destroying King of Death!
511Naked She roams about the world, slaying Her demon foes,
Or stands erect on Śiva's breast.
Her feet upon Her Husband's form! What a strange wife She
makes!
My Mother's play, declares Prasad, shatters all rules and laws:
Strive hard for purity, O mind,
And understand my Mother's ways.
And again:
I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,
As I repeat my Mother Kāli's name;
It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk! . . .
And again:
Can everyone have the vision of Syama? Is Kāli's treasure for
everyone?
Oh, what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true!
Even with all His penances, rarely does Śiva Himself behold
The mind-bewitching sight of Mother Syama's crimson feet.
To him who meditates on Her the riches of heaven are poor
indeed;
If Syama casts Her glance on him, he swims in Eternal Bliss.
The prince of yogis, the king of the gods, meditate on Her feet
in vain
Yet worthless kamalakanta yearns for the Mother's blessed feet!
The Master's ecstatic mood gradually relaxed. He stopped singing and sat in silence.
After a while he got up and sat on the small couch.
Pundit Shashadhar was charmed with his singing. Very humbly he said to Sri
Ramakrishna, "Are you going to sing anymore?"
A little later the Master sang again:
High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring
like a kite,
When came a blast of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly
toward the earth. . . .
Then he sang:
Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood;
From One who knows it well, I have learnt the secret of bhava.
A man has come to me from a country where there is no night,
And now I cannot distinguish day from night any longer;
Rituals and devotions have all grown profitless for me.
My sleep is broken; how can I slumber any more?
For now I am wide awake in the sleeplessness of yoga.
O Divine Mother, made one with Thee in yoga-sleep at last,
My slumber I have lulled asleep for evermore.
512I bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation;
Knowing the secret that Kāli is one with the highest Brahman,
I have discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin.
Sri Ramakrishna continued:
I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother;
Am I afraid of Death any more?
Unto the tuft of hair on my head.
Is tied the almighty mantra, Mother Kāli's name.
My body I have sold in the market-place of the world
And with it have bought Sri Durga's name.
As Sri Ramakrishna sang the line, "And with it have bought Sri Durga's name", the tears
flowed from Pundit Shashadhar's eyes. The Master went on with the song:
Deep within my heart I have planted the name of Kāli,
The Wish-fulfilling Tree of heaven;
When Yama, King of Death, appears,
To him I shall open my heart and show it growing there.
I have cast out from me my six unflagging foes;4
Ready am I to sail life's sea,
Crying, "To Durga, victory!"
Again he sang:
Dwell, O mind, within yourself;
Enter no other's home.
If you but seek there, you will find
All you are searching for. . . .
And again:
Though I am never loath to grant salvation,
I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.
Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;
He is adored by men;
He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .
Mere study of scriptures is futile
The pundit had studied the Vedas and the other scriptures. He loved to discuss
philosophy. The Master, seated on the couch, cast his benign look on the pundit and
gave him counsel through parables.
MASTER (to the pundit): "There are many scriptures like the Vedas. But one cannot
realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline. 'God cannot be found in the six
systems, the Vedas, or the Tantra.'
"But one should learn the contents of the scriptures and then act according to their
injunctions. A man lost a letter. He couldn't remember where he had left it. He began to
513search for it with a lamp. After two or three people had searched, the letter was at last
found. The message in the letter was: 'Please send us five seers of sandesh and a piece
of wearing-cloth.' The man read it and then threw the letter away. There was no further
need of it; now all he had to do was to buy the five seers of sandesh and the piece of
cloth.
Reading, hearing, and seeing
"Better than reading is hearing, and better than hearing is seeing. One understands the
scriptures better by hearing them from the lips of the guru or of a holy man. Then one
doesn't have to think about their non-essential part.
Hanuman said: 'Brother, I don't know much about the phase of the moon or the position
of the stars. I just contemplate Rāma.'
"But seeing is far better than hearing. Then all doubts disappear. It is true that many
things are recorded in the scriptures; but all these are useless without the direct
realization of God, without devotion to His Lotus Feet, without purity of heart. The
almanac forecasts the rainfall of the year. But not a drop of water will you get by
squeezing the almanac. No, not even one drop.
"How long should one reason about the texts of the scriptures? So long as one does not
have direct realization of God. How long does the bee buzz about? As long as it is not
sitting on a flower. No sooner does it light on a flower and begin to sip honey than it
keeps quiet.
"But you must remember another thing. One may talk even after the realization of God.
But then one talks only of God and of Divine Bliss. It is like a drunkard's crying, 'Victory
to the Divine Mother!' He can hardly say anything else on account of his drunkenness.
You can notice, too, that a bee makes an indistinct humming sound after having sipped
the honey from a flower.
The nature of jnanis and vijnanis
"The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not this'.
Reasoning in this way, he at last comes to a state of Bliss, and that is Brahman. What is
the nature of a Jnāni? He behaves according to scriptural injunctions.
"Once I was taken to Chanak and saw some sādhus there. Several of them were sewing.
(All laugh.) At the sight of us they threw aside their sewing. They sat straight, crossing
their legs, and conversed with us. (All laugh.)
"But jnanis will not talk about spiritual things without being asked. They will inquire, at
first, about such things as your health and your family.
"But the nature of the vijnāni is different. He is unconcerned about anything. Perhaps he
carries his wearing-cloth loose under his arm, like a child; or perhaps the cloth has
dropped from his body altogether.
514"The man who knows that God exists is called a Jnāni. A Jnāni is like one who knows
beyond a doubt that a log of wood contains fire. But a vijnāni is he who lights the log,
cooks over the fire, and is nourished by the food. The eight fetters have fallen from the
vijnāni. He may keep merely the appearance of lust, anger, and the rest."
PUNDIT: "The knots of his heart are cut asunder; all his doubts are destroyed."
MASTER: "Yes. Once a ship sailed into the ocean. Suddenly its iron joints, nails, and
screws fell out. The ship was passing a magnetic hill, and so all its iron was loosened.
"I used to go to Krishnakishore's house. Once, when I was there, he said to me, 'Why do
you chew betel-leaf?' I said: 'It is my sweet pleasure. I shall chew betel-leaf, look at my
face in the mirror, and dance naked among a thousand girls.' Krishnakishore's wife
scolded him and said: 'What have you said to Ramakrishna? You don't know how to talk
to people.'
"In this state, passions like lust and anger are burnt up, though nothing happens to the
physical body. It looks just like any other body; but the inside is all hollow and pure."
A DEVOTEE: "Does the body remain even after the realization of God?"
MASTER: "The body survives with some so that they may work out their prarabdha
karma or work for the welfare of others. By bathing in the Ganges a man gets rid of his
sin and attains liberation. But if he happens to be blind, he doesn't get rid of his
blindness. Of course, he escapes future births, which would otherwise be necessary for
reaping the results of his past sinful karma. His present body remains alive as long as its
momentum7 is not exhausted; but future births are no longer possible. The wheel moves
as long as the impulse that has set it in motion lasts. Then it comes to a stop. In the
case of such a person, passions like lust and anger are burnt up. Only the body remains
alive to perform a few actions."
PUNDIT: "That is called samskara."
The nature of jnanis and vijnanis
MASTER: "The vijnāni always sees God. That is why he is so indifferent about the world.
He sees God even with his eyes open. Sometimes he comes down to the Lila from the
Nitya, and sometimes he goes up to the Nitya from the Lila."
PUNDIT: "I don't understand that."
MASTER: "The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', and at
last reaches the Eternal and Indivisible Satchidananda. He reasons in this manner:
'Brahman is not the living beings; It is neither the universe nor the twenty-four cosmic
principles.' As a result of such reasoning he attains the Absolute. Then he realizes that it
is the Absolute that has become all this-the universe, its living beings, and the twenty-
four cosmic principles.
515"Milk sets into curd, and the curd is churned into butter. After extracting the butter one
realizes that butter is not essentially different from buttermilk and buttermilk not
essentially different from butter. The bark of a tree goes with the pith and the pith goes
with the bark."
PUNDIT (smiling, to Bhudar): "Did you understand that? It is very difficult."
All-embracing realization of the vijnāni
MASTER: "If there is butter, there must be buttermilk also. If you think of butter, you
must also think of buttermilk along with it; for there cannot be any butter without
buttermilk. Just so, if you accept the Nitya, you must also accept the Lila. It is the
process of negation and affirmation. You realize the Nitya by negating the Lila. Then you
affirm the Lila, seeing in it the manifestation of the Nitya. One attains this state after
realizing Reality in both aspects: Personal and Impersonal. The Personal is the
embodiment of Chit, Consciousness; and the Impersonal is the Indivisible
Satchidananda.
"Brahman alone has become everything. Therefore to be vijnāni this world is a 'mansion
of myrth'. But to the Jnāni it is a 'framework of illusion'. Ramprasad described the world
as a 'framework of illusion'. Another man said to him by way of retort:
This very world is a mansion of myrth;
Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.
O physician, you are a fool!
You see only the surface of things.
Janaka's might was unsurpassed;
What did he lack of the world or the Spirit?
Holding to one as well as the other,
He drank his milk from a brimming cup!
"The vijnāni enjoys the bliss of God in a richer way. Some have heard of milk, some
have seen it, and some have drunk it. The vijnāni has drunk milk, enjoyed it, and been
nourished by it."
The Master remained silent a few moments and then asked Pundit Shashadhar to have a
smoke. The Pundit went to the south east verandah to smoke. Soon he came back to the
room and sat on the floor with the devotees. Seated on the small couch, the Master
continued the conversation.
MASTER (to the Pundit): "Let me tell you something. There are three kinds of Ānanda,
joy: the joy of worldly enjoyment, the joy of worship, and the Joy of Brahman. The joy
of worldly enjoyment is the joy of 'woman and gold', which people always enjoy. The joy
of worship one enjoys while chanting the name and glories of God. And the Joy of
Brahman is the joy of God-vision. After experiencing the joy of God-vision the rishis of
olden times went beyond all rules and conventions.
516Three states of God-Consciousness
"Chaitanyadeva used to experience three spiritual states: the inmost, the semi-
conscious, and the conscious. In the inmost state he would see God and go into
samādhi. He would be in the state of jada samādhi. In the semi-conscious state he
would be partially conscious of the outer world. In the conscious state he could sing the
name and glories of God."
HAZRA (to the Pundit): "So your doubts are now solved."
Samādhi described
MASTER (to the Pundit): "What is samādhi? It is the complete merging of the mind in
God-Consciousness. The Jnāni experiences jada samādhi, in which no trace of 'I' is left.
The samādhi attained through the path of bhakti is called 'chetana samādhi'. In this
samādhi there remains the conciousness of 'I' ― the 'I' of the servant-and-Master
relationship, of the lover-and-Beloved relationship, of the enjoyer-and-Food relationship.
God is the Master; the devotee is the servant. God is the beloved; the devotee is the
lover. God is the Food, and the devotee is the enjoyer. 'I don't want to be sugar. I want
to eat it.' "
PUNDIT: "What will happen if God dissolves all of the 'I', if He changes the enjoyer
himself into sugar?"
MASTER (smiling): "Come, come! Tell me what is in your mind. But don't the scriptures
mention Nārada, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda, and Sanatkumara?"
PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. They do."
MASTER: "Though they were jnanis, yet they kept the 'I' of the bhakta. Haven't you read
the Bhagavata?"
PUNDIT: "I have read only part of it, not the whole."
MASTER: "Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to the words of His
devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you desire from Him."
PUNDIT: "I haven't thought deeply about these things before. But now I understand."
MASTER: "God keeps a little of 'I' in His devotee even after giving him the Knowledge of
Brahman. That 'I' is the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnāni'. Through that 'I' the
devotee enjoys the infinite play of God.
"The pestle was almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left. That fell into the
underbrush and brought about the destruction of the lunar race, the race of the Yadus.
The vijnāni retains the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnāni', in order to taste the Bliss of
God and teach people.
517"The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do you know their
attitude? It was this: 'Let me somehow get my own salvation; who cares for others?' A
hollow piece of drift-wood somehow manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on
it. But Nārada and sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to
the other shore but can carry many animals and other creatures as well. A steamship
itself crosses the ocean and also carries people across.
The vijnāni is fearless and joyous
"Teachers like Nārada belong to the class of the vijnāni. They were much more
courageous than the other rishis. They are like an expert satrancha-player. You must
have noticed how he shouts, as he throws the dice: 'What do I want? Six? No, five! Here
is five!' And every time he throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a
clever player! And while playing he even twirls his moustaches.
"A mere Jnāni trembles with fear. He is like an amateur satrancha-player. He is anxious
to move his pieces somehow to the safety zone, where they won't be overtaken by his
opponent. But a vijnāni isn't afraid of anything. He has realized both aspects of God:
Personal and Impersonal. He has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God.
"It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through contemplation. And it
is also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the Relative, without dissolving it in the
Absolute.
"A mere Jnāni is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: 'It is not this, not
this. The world is like a dream.' But I have 'raised both my hands'. Therefore I accept
everything.
Parable of the weaver woman
"Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The weaver, who had
been spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very happy to see her friend and said to
her: 'Friend, I can't tell you how happy I am to see you. Let me get you some
refreshments.' She left the room. The woman looked at the threads of different colours
and was tempted. She hid a bundle of thread under one arm. The weaver returned
presently with the refreshments and began to feed her guest with great enthusiasm. But,
looking at the thread, she realized that her friend had taken a bundle. Hitting upon a
plan to get it back, she said: 'Friend, it is so long since I have seen you. This is a day of
great joy for me. I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.' The friend said,
'Sister, I am feeling very happy too.' So the two friends began to dance together. When
the weaver saw that her friend danced without raising her hands, she said: 'Friend, let
us dance with both hands raised. This is a day of great joy.' But the guest pressed one
arm to her side and danced raising only the other. The weaver said: 'How is this, friend?
Why should you dance with only one hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands.
Look at me. See how I dance with both hands raised.' But the guest still pressed one
arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and said with a smile, 'This is all
I know of dancing.' "
518The Master continued: "I don't press my arm to my side. Both my hands are free. I am
not afraid of anything. I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the
Relative.
The two kinds of ego
"I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realize God without renouncing the
ego. He said, 'Sir, in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together.'
Thereupon I said to him: 'I am asking you to give up the "unripe ego", the "wicked ego".
But there is no harm in the "ripe ego", the "child ego", the "servant ego", the "ego of
Knowledge".'
"The worldly man's ego, the 'ignorant ego', the 'unripe ego', is like a thick stick. It
divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda. But the 'servant ego', the
'child ego', the 'ego of Knowledge', is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there
is only one expanse of water. The dividing line makes it appear that the water has two
parts, but one clearly sees that in reality there is only one expanse of water.
"Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach people. God keeps in
many people the 'ego of a Jnāni' or the 'ego of a bhakta' even after they have attained
Brahmajnana. Hanuman, after realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal
aspect, cherished toward God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rāma: 'O
Rāma, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I
think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And sometimes, Rāma, when I
contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are I.'
"Yaśoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha.
Radha saw Yaśoda's suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Śakti, which was
her real nature. She said to Yaśoda: 'Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I
am ChitŚakti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me: Yaśoda said: 'I don't want
Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this: that I may see the form of Gopala in my
meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna's devotees; that I may
always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God's name and glories.'
"Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them
to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they
all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six
celestial splendours. But they did not like it. They said to Krishna: 'We want to see
Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don't want anything else.'
"Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to
the gopis. He said to them: 'I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you
see only one form of Mine?' The gopis cried in chorus: 'O Krishna, do You want to go
away from us? Is that why You are instructing us in Brahmajnana?'
"Do you know the attitude of the gopis? It is this: 'We are Radha's and Radha is ours.' "
A DEVOTEE: "Does this 'I' of the devotee never disappear altogether?"
519MASTER: "Yes, it disappears at times. Then one attains the Knowledge of Brahman and
goes into samādhi. I too lose it, but not for all the time. In the musical scale there are
seven notes: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni. But one cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a
long time. One must bring it down again to the lower notes. I pray to the Divine Mother,
'Mother, do not give me Brahmajnana.' Formerly believers in God with form used to visit
me a great deal. Then the modern Brahmajnanis began to arrive. During that period I
used to remain unconscious in samādhi most of the time. Whenever I regained
consciousness, I would say to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, please don't give me
Brahmajnana.'"
God listens to our prayer
PUNDIT: "Does God listen to our prayers?"
MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. You will certainly get whatever
you ask of Him. But you must pray standing near the Kalpataru. Only then will your
prayer be fulfilled. But you must remember another thing. God knows our inner feeling.
A man gets the fulfillment of the desire he cherishes while practising sadhana. As one
thinks, so one receives. A magician was showing his tricks before a king. Now and then
he exclaimed: 'Come confusion! Come delusion! O King, give me money! Give me
clothes!' Suddenly his tongue turned upward and clove to the roof of his mouth. He
experienced kumbhaka. He could utter neither word nor sound, and became motionless.
People thought he was dead. They built a vault of bricks and buried him there in that
posture. After a thousand years someone dug into the vault. Inside it people found a
man seated in samādhi. They took him for a holy man and worshipped him. When they
shook him his tongue was loosened and regained its normal position. The magician
became conscious of the outer world and cried, as he had a thousand years before:
'Come confusion! Come delusion! O King, give me money! Give me clothes!'
"I used to weep, praying to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, destroy with Thy thunderbolt
my inclination to reason.' "
PUNDIT: "Then you too had an inclination to reason?"
MASTER :"Yes, once."
PUNDIT: "Then please assure us that we shall get rid of that inclination too. How did you
get rid of yours?"
MASTER: "Oh, somehow or other."
Sri Ramakrishna was silent awhile. Then he went on with his conversation.
MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru. One should pray standing near It. Then one will get
whatever one desires.
"How many things God has created! Infinite is His universe. But what need have I to
know about His infinite splendours? If I must know these, let me first realize Him. Then
520God Himself will tell me all about them. What need have I to know how many houses
and how many government securities Jadu Mallick possesses? All that I need is somehow
to converse with Jadu Mallick. I may succeed in seeing him by jumping over a ditch or
through a petition or after being pushed about by his gate-keeper. Once I get a chance
to talk to him, then he himself will tell me all about his possessions if I ask him. If one
becomes acquainted with the master, then one is respected by his officers too. (All
laugh.)
"There are some who do not care to know the splendours of God. What do I care about
knowing how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One bottle is enough for me.
Why should I desire the knowledge of God's splendours? I am intoxicated with the little
wine I have swallowed.
"Both bhaktiyoga and jnanayoga are paths by which you can realize God. Whatever path
you may follow, you will certainly realize Him. The path of bhakti is an easy one. The
path of knowledge and discrimination is very difficult. Why should one reason so much to
know which path is the best? I talked about this with Vijay for many days. Once I told
him about a man who used to pray, 'O God, reveal to me who and what You are.'
"The path of knowledge and discrimination is difficult indeed. Parvati, the Divine Mother,
revealed Her various forms to Her father and said, 'Father, if you want Brahmajnana,
then live in the company of holy men.'
"Brahman cannot be described in words. It is said in the Rāma Gitā that Brahman has
only been indirectly hinted at by the scriptures. When one speaks about the 'cowherd
village on the Ganges', one indirectly states that the village is situated on the bank of
the Ganges.
"Why shouldn't a man be able to realize the formless Brahman? But it is extremely
difficult. He cannot if he has even the slightest trace of worldliness. He can be directly
aware of Brahman in his inmost consciousness only when he renounces all sense-
objects―form, taste, smell, touch, and sound and only when his mind completely stops
functioning. And then too, he knows only this much of Brahman―that It exists."
Quoting from an Upanishad, the pundit said, "It is to be experienced only as Existence."
MASTER: "In order to realize God a devotee should make use of a particular attitude-the
attitude of a 'hero' or a friend or a handmaid or a child."
MANI MALLICK: "Only then can one feel attached to God."
MASTER: "For many days I cherished the feeling that I was a companion of the Divine
Mother. I used to say: 'I am the handmaid of Brahmamayi, the Blissful Mother. O
companions of the Divine Mother, make me the Mother's handmaid! I shall go about
proudly, saying, "I am Brahmamayi's handmaid!"
521Different classes of perfect souls
"Some souls realize God without practising any spiritual discipline. They are called
nityasiddha, eternally perfect. Those who have realized God through austerity, japa, and
the like, are called sadhanasiddha, perfect through spiritual discipline. Again, there are
those called kripasiddha, perfect through divine grace. These last may be compared to a
room kept dark a thousand years, which becomes light the moment a lamp is brought in.
"There is also a class of devotees, the hathatsiddha, that is to say, those who have
suddenly attained God-vision. Their case is like that of a poor boy who has suddenly
found favour with a rich man. The rich man marries his daughter to the boy and along
with her gives him land, house, carriage, servants, and so forth.
"There is still another class of devotees, the svapnasiddha, who have had the vision of
God in a dream."
SURENDRA (smiling): "Let us go to sleep then. We shall wake and find ourselves babus,
aristocrats."
MASTER (tenderly): "You are already a babu. When the letter 'a' is joined to the letter
'ka', 'ka' becomes 'kaa'. It is futile to add another 'a'. If you add it, you will still have the
same 'kaa'. (All laugh.)
Description of the nitya-siddha
"The nityasiddha is in a class apart. He is like arani wood. A little rubbing produces fire.
You can get fire from it even without rubbing. The nityasiddha realizes God by practising
slight spiritual discipline and sometimes without practising any at all. But he does
practise spiritual discipline after realizing God. He is like the gourd or pumpkin vine―first
fruit, then flower."
The pundit smiled at this illustration.
MASTER: "There is the instance of Prahlada. He was a nityasiddha. While writing the
letter 'ka' he shed a stream of tears."
The Master was pleased with the pundit's humility. He praised him to the devotees.
MASTER: "He has such a nice nature. You find no difficulty in driving a nail into a mud
wall. But its point breaks if you try to drive it against a stone; and still it will not pierce
it. There are people whose spiritual consciousness is not at all awakened even though
they hear about God a thousand times. They are like a crocodile, on whose hide you
cannot make any impression with a sword "
PUNDIT: "But one can hurt a crocodile by throwing a spear into its belly." (All laugh.)
MASTER (smiling): "What good is there in reading a whole lot of scriptures? What good
is there in the study of philosophy? What is the use of talking big? In order to learn
522archery one should first aim at a banana tree, then at a reed, then at a wick, and last at
a flying bird. At the beginning one should concentrate on God with form.
"Then there are devotees who are beyond the three gunas. They are eternally devoted to
God, like Nārada. These devotees behold Krishna as Chinmaya, all Spirit, His Abode as
Chinmaya, His devotee as Chinmaya. To them God is eternal, His Abode is eternal, His
devotee is eternal.
"Those who reason and speculate following the process of 'Neti, neti' do not accept the
Incarnation of God. Hazra says well that Divine Incarnation is only for the bhakta, and
not for the Jnāni, because the Jnāni is quite contented with his ideal, 'I am He'."
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees remained silent awhile. The pundit resumed the
conversation.
PUNDIT: "Sir, how does one get rid of callousness? Laughter makes me think of muscles
and nerves. Grief makes me think of the nervous system."
MASTER (smiling): "That is why Narayan Shastri used to say, The harmful effect of the
study of the scriptures is that it encourages reasoning and arguing.'"
PUNDIT: "Is there no way for us then?"
MASTER: "Yes, there is the path of discrimination. In a song occurs the line: 'Ask her son
Discrimination about the Truth.'
"The way lies through discrimination, renunciation, and passionate yearning for God.
Unless a man practises discrimination, he cannot utter the right words. One time, after
expounding religion at great length, Pundit Samadhyayi said, 'God is dry.' He reminded
me of the man who once said, 'My uncle's cow-shed is full of horses.' Now, does anyone
keep horses in a cowshed? (With a smile) You have become like a chānābarā fried in
butter. Now it will be good for you and for others as well, if you are soaked in syrup a
few days. Just a few days."
PUNDIT (smiling): "The sweetmeat is over-fried. It has become charred."
MASTER (with a laugh): "No! No! It is brown as a cockroach. Just the right colour."
HAZRA: "The sweetmeat is well cooked. It has become spongy. Now it will soak up the
syrup nicely."
MASTER: "You see, there is no need to read too much of the scriptures. If you read too
much you will be inclined to reason and argue. Nangta used to teach me thus: What you
get by repeating the word 'Gitā' tell times is the essence of the book. In other words, if
you repeat 'Gitā' ten times it is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.
523"Yes, the way to realize God is through discrimination, renunciation, and yearning for
Him. What kind of yearning? One should yearn for God as the cow, with yearning heart,
runs after its calf."
PUNDIT: "The same thing is said in the Vedas: 'O God, we call on Thee as the cow lows
for the calf.'"
MASTER: "Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce everything through
discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able to see God. That yearning brings
about God-intoxication, whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of
devotion. The sage Durvasa was mad with the Knowledge of God.
"There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a householder and that of
an all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder's knowledge is like the light of a lamp,
which illumines only the inside of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such
knowledge, except his own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the all-
renouncing monk is like the light of the sun. Through that light he can see both, inside
and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva's knowledge had the brilliance of the sun-the sun
of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing light of the moon of Devotion. He was
endowed with both-the Knowledge of Brahman and ecstatic love of God.
(To the pundit) "One can attain spiritual consciousness through both affirmation and
negation. There is the positive path of love and devotion, and there is the negative path
of knowledge and discrimination. You are preaching the path of knowledge. But that
creates a very difficult situation: there the guru and the disciple do not see each other.
Sukadeva went to Janaka for instruction about the Knowledge of Brahman. Janaka said
to him: 'You must pay me the guru's fee beforehand. When you attain the knowledge of
Brahman you won't pay me the fee, because the knower of Brahman sees no difference
between the guru and the disciple.'
Different stages of divine love
"Both negation and affirmation are ways to realize one and the same goal. Infinite are
the opinions and infinite are the ways. But you must remember one thing. The injunction
is that the path of devotion described by Nārada is best suited to the Kaliyuga. According
to this path, first comes bhakti; then bhava, when bhakti is mature. Higher than bhava
are mahabhava and prema. An ordinary mortal does not attain mahabhava and prema.
He who has achieved these has realized the goal, that is to say, has attained God."
PUNDIT: "In expounding religion one has to use a great many words."
MASTER: "While preaching, eliminate the 'head and tail', that is to say, emphasize only
the essentials."
The pundit and Mani Mallick became engaged in conversation. Mani was a member of the
Brahmo Samaj. The pundit argued vehemently about the good and bad sides of the
Samaj. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the small couch and looked on, smiling. Presently
he remarked: "This is the tamasic aspect of sattva, the attitude of a hero. This is
524necessary. One should not hold one's tongue at the sight of injustice and untruth.
Suppose a bad woman wants to drag you from the path of righteousness. You must then
assume the heroic attitude and say: 'What? You witch! You dare injure my spiritual life? I
shall cut your body in two right now.' "
With a smile Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Mani Mallick has been following the
tenets of the Brahmo Samaj a long time. You can't convert him to your views. Is it an
easy thing to destroy old tendencies? Once there lived a very pious Hindu who always
worshipped the Divine Mother and chanted Her name. When the Muslims conquered
the country, they forced him embrace Islam. They said to him: 'You are now a
Mussalman. Say "Allah". From now on you must repeat only the name of Allah.' With
great difficulty he repeated the word 'Allah', but every now and then blurted out
'Jagadamba'. At that the Muslims were about to beat him. Thereupon he said to
them: 'I beseech you! Please do not kill me. I have been trying my utmost to repeat the
name of Allah, but our Jagadamba has filled me up to the throat. She pushes out your
Allah.' (All laugh.)
Different paths to suit different tastes
(To the pundit) "Please don't say anything to Mani Mallick. You must know that there are
different tastes. There are also different powers of digestion. God has made different
religions and creeds to suit different aspirants. By no means all are fit for the Knowledge
of Brahman. Therefore the worship of God with form has been provided.
"The mother brings home a fish for her children. She curries part of the fish, part she
fries, and with another part she makes pilau. By no means all can digest the pilau. So
she makes fish soup for those who have weak stomachs. Further, some want pickled or
fried fish. There are different temperaments. There are differences in the capacity to
comprehend."
All sat in silence. Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit, "Go and visit the temples and take
a stroll in the garden." It was about half past five in the afternoon. The pundit left the
room with his friends and several of the devotees.
After a while the Master went with M. toward the bathing-ghat on the Ganges. He said to
M., "Baburam now says, 'What shall I gain by study?' "On the bank of the river he met
the pundit and said to him, "Aren't you going to the Kāli temple?" The pundit said: "Yes,
sir. Let us go together." With a smiling face Sri Ramakrishna proceeded to the temple
through the courtyard. He said to the pundit, "Listen to a song."
He sang:
Is Kāli, my Mother, really black?
The Naked One, of blackest hue,
Lights the Lotus of the Heart. . . .
As he was going through the courtyard, he quoted to the pundit from a song:
525Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart,
Behold the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment.
They came to the temple. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother, touching the
ground with his forehead.
Red hibiscus flowers and vilwa-leaves adorned the Mother's feet. Her three eyes radiated
love for Her devotees. Two of Her hands were raised as if to give them boons and
reassurance; the other two hands held symbols of death. She was clothed in a sari of
Benares silk and was decked with ornaments.
Image of Kāli
Referring to the image, one of the party remarked, "I heard it was made by the sculptor
Nabin." The Master answered: "Yes, I know. But to me She is the Embodiment of Spirit."
As Sri Ramakrishna was coming back to his room with the devotees, he said to
Baburam, "Come with us." M. also joined them.
It was dusk. The Master was sitting on the semicircular porch west of his room. Baburam
and M. sat near him. He was in a mood of partial ecstasy.
Rākhāl was not then living with Sri Ramakrishna, and therefore the Master was having
difficulties about his personal service. Several devotees lived with him, but he could not
bear the touch of everyone during his spiritual moods. He hinted to Baburam: "Do stay
with me. It will be very nice. In this mood I cannot allow others to touch me."
The pundit entered the Master's room after visiting the temples. The Master said to him
from the porch, "Take some refreshments." The pundit said that he had not yet
performed his evening devotions. At once Sri Ramakrishna stood up and sang in an
exalted mood:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or
Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli's name upon my
lips?
What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any
more,
If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours? . . .
Intoxicated With ecstatic love, the Master said: "How long should one perform
devotions? So long as one's mind does not merge in God while repeating Om."
PUNDIT: "Then let me eat the refreshments. I shall perform the devotions later on."
MASTER: "No, I don't want to obstruct the current of your life. It is not good to renounce
anything before the proper time arrives. When the fruit ripens, the flower drops off of
526itself. One shouldn't forcibly tear off the green branch of a coconut tree. That injures the
tree."
Surendra was about to leave. He invited his friends into his carriage. The Master, still in
an ecstatic mood, said, "Don't take more people than your horse can draw." Suredra
took leave of Sri Ramakrishna. The pundit left the room to perform his worship. M. and
Baburam saluted the Master. They were about to leave for Calcutta. Sri Ramakrishna
was still in an ecstatic mood.
MASTER (to M.): "I cannot utter a word now. Stay a few minutes."
M. again took his seat and waited for the Master's command. Sri Ramakrishna motioned
to Baburam to take a seat and asked him to fan him a little. M. also took part in
rendering this personal service to the Master.
MASTER (to M., tenderly): "Why don't you come here so frequently now?"
M: "Not for any special reason. I have been rather busy at home."
MASTER: "Yesterday I came to know Baburam's inner nature. That is why I have been
trying so hard to persuade him to live with me. The mother bird hatches the egg in
proper time. Boys like Baburam are pure in heart. They have not yet fallen into the
clutches of 'woman and gold'. Isn't that so?"
M: "It is true, sir. They are still stainless."
MASTER: "They are like a new pot. Milk kept in it will not turn sour."
M: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "I need Baburam here. I pass through certain spiritual states when I need
someone like him. He says he must not, all at once, live with me permanently, for it will
create difficulties. His relatives will make trouble. I am asking him to come here
Saturdays and Sundays."
Master's advice to householders
The pundit entered the room with his friends. He had finished his devotions and was
ready to eat the refreshments. One of his companions asked the Master: "Shall we
succeed in spiritual life? Please tell us what our way is."
MASTER: "You all have the yearning for liberation. If an aspirant has yearning, that is
enough for him to realize God. Don't eat any food of the sraaddha ceremony. Live in the
world like an unchaste woman. She performs her household duties with great attention,
but her mind dwells day and night on her paramour. Perform your duties in the world but
keep your mind always fixed on God.
The pundit finished eating his refreshments.
527MASTER (to the pundit): "You have read the Gitā, no doubt. It says that there is a
special power of God in the man who is honoured and respected by all."
The pundit quoted the verse from the Gitā.
MASTER: "You surely possess divine power."
PUNDIT: "Shall I labour with perseverance to finish the task that I have accepted?"
Sri Ramakrishna forced himself, as it were, to say, "Yes." He soon changed the
conversation.
MASTER: "One cannot but admit the manifestation of power. Vidyasagar once asked me,
'Has God given more power to some than to others?' I said to him: 'Certainly. Otherwise,
how can one man kill a hundred? If there is no special manifestation of power, then why
is Queen Victoria so much honoured and respected? Don't you admit it?' He agreed with
me."
The pundit and his friends saluted the Master and were about to take their leave. Sri
Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Come again. One hemp-smoker rejoices in the
company of another hemp-smoker. They even embrace each other. But they hide at the
sight of people not of their own kind. A cow licks the body of her calf; but she threatens
a strange cow with her horns." (All laugh.)
The pundit left the room. With a smile the Master said: "He has become 'diluted' even in
one day. Did you notice how modest he was? And he accepted everything I said."
Moonlight flooded the semicircular porch. Sri Ramakrishna was still seated there. M. was
about to leave.
MASTER (tenderly): "Must you go now?"
M.: "Yes, sir. Let me say good-bye."
MASTER: "I have been thinking of visiting the houses of the devotees. I want to visit
yours also. What do you say?"
M.: "That will be very fine."
Thursday, July 3, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in Balarām Bose's house in Calcutta. It was the day of the
"Return Car Festival". The Lord of the Universe was worshipped in Balarām's house as
Jagannath. There was a small car in the house for use during the Car Festival.
Balarām's father
Balarām's father was a pious Vaishnava who devoted most of his time to prayer and
meditation in his garden house at Vrindāvan. He also studied devotional books and
528enjoyed the company of devotees. Balarām had brought his father to Calcutta to meet
the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy mood. Seated near him were Ram, Balarām,
Balarām's father, M., Manomohan, and several young devotees. He was conversing with
them.
Dogmatism in religion
MASTER (to Balarām's father and the others): "The Bhaktamala is one of the Vaishnava
books. It is a fine book. It describes the lives of the various Vaishnava devotees. But it is
one-sided. At one place the author found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati,
the Divine Mother, to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline.
"Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to invite
Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great courtesy. He fed his
guest from silver plates. Then do you know what happened? Vaishnav said in front of
Mathur, 'You will achieve nothing whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna
as your Ideal.' Mathur was a follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine
Mother. At once his face became crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan.
"I understand that the Bhagavata also contains some statements like that. I hear that it
is said there that trying to cross the ocean of the world without accepting Krishna as the
Ideal Deity is like trying to cross a great sea by holding the tail of a dog. Each sect
magnifies its own view.
"The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas say that Krishna alone is
the Helmsman to take one across the ocean of the world. The Saktas retort: 'Oh, yes!
We agree to that. Our Divine Mother is the Empress of the Universe. Why should She
bother about a ferry-boat? Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the
purpose.' (All laugh.)
"Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers in the villages
near Kamarpukur. Many of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: 'Which
Vishnu does he worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn't touch him!' Or: 'Which Śiva are
you talking about? We accept the Atmaramasiva.' Or again, 'Please explain to us which
Hari you worship'. They spin their yarn and indulge in talk like that.
"Rati's mother, Rani Katyayani's favourite confidante, is a follower of Vaishnavcharan.
She is a bigoted Vaishnava. She used to visit me very frequently, and none could outdo
her in devotion. One day she noticed me eating the prasad from the Kāli temple. Since
then I haven't seen even her shadow.
Master's harmony of religions
"He is indeed a real man who has harmonized everything. Most people are one-sided.
But I find that all opinions point to the One. All views-the Sakta, the Vaishnava, the
Vedānta-have that One for their centre. He who is formless is, again, endowed with
529form. It is He who appears in different forms: The attributeless Brahman is my Father.
God with attributes is my Mother. Whom shall I blame? Whom shall I praise? The two
pans of the scales are equally heavy.'
"He who is described in the Vedas is also described in the Tantras and the Puranas. All of
them speak about the one Satchidananda. The Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of
the one Reality. It is described in the Vedas as 'Om Satchidananda Brahman', in the
Tantras as 'Om Satchidananda Śiva', the ever-pure Śiva, and in the Puranas as 'Om
Satchidananda Krishna'. All the scriptures, the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras,
speak only of one Satchidananda. It is stated in the Vaishnava scripture that it is Krishna
Himself who has become Kāli."
Sri Ramakrishna went to the porch for a few minutes and then returned. As he was
going out, Vishvamvhar's daughter, six or seven years old, saluted him. On returning to
the room, the Master began talking to the little girl and her companions, who were of the
same age.
THE CHILD (to the Master): "I saluted you and you didn't even notice it."
MASTER (smiling): "Did you? I really didn't notice."
CHILD: "Then wait. I want to salute you again-the other foot too."
Sri Ramakrishna laughed and sat down. He returned the salute and bowed to the child,
touching the ground with his forehead. He asked her to sing. The child said, "I swear I
don't sing." When the Master pressed her again, she said, "Should you press me when I
said 'I swear'?" The Master was very happy with the children and sang light and frivolous
songs to entertain them. He sang:
Come, let me braid your hair,
Lest your husband should scold you
When he beholds you!
The children and the devotees laughed.
Childlike nature of a Paramahamsa
MASTER (to the devotees): "The paramahamsa is like a five-year-old child. He sees
everything filled with Consciousness. At one time I was staying at Kamarpukur when
Shivaram was four or five years old. One day he was trying to catch grasshoppers near
the pond. The leaves were moving. To stop their rustling he said to the leaves: 'Hush!
Hush! I want to catch a grasshopper.' Another day it was stormy. It rained hard.
Shivaram was with me inside the house. There were flashes of lightning. He wanted to
open the door and go out. I scolded him and stopped him, but still he peeped out now
and then. When he saw the lightning he exclaimed, 'There, uncle! They are striking
matches again!'
530"The paramahamsa is like a child. He cannot distinguish between a stranger and a
relative. He isn't particular about worldly relationships. One day Shivaram said to me,
'Uncle, are you my father's brother or his brother-in-law?'
"The paramahamsa is like a child. He doesn't keep any track of his whereabouts. He sees
everything as Brahman. He is indifferent to his own movements. Shivaram went to
Hriday's house to see the Durga Puja. He slipped out of the house and wandered away. A
passer-by saw the child, who was then only four years old, and asked, 'Where do you
come from?' He couldn't say much. He only said the word 'hut'. He was speaking of the
big hut in which the image of the Divine Mother was being worshipped. The stranger
asked him further, 'Whom are you living with?' He only said the word 'brother'.
Other traits of a Paramahamsa
"Sometimes the paramahamsa behaves like a madman. When I experienced that divine
madness I used to worship my own sexual organ as the Śiva-phallus. But I can't do that
now. A few days after the dedication of the temple at Dakshineswar, a madman came
there who was really a sage endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman. He had a bamboo
twig in one hand and a potted mango-plant in the other, and was wearing torn shoes. He
didn't follow any social conventions. After bathing in the Ganges he didn't perform any
religious rites. He ate something that he carried in a corner of his wearing-cloth. Then he
entered the Kāli temple and chanted hymns to the Deity. The temple trembled. Haladhāri
was then in the shrine. The madman wasn't allowed to eat at the guest-house, but he
paid no attention to this slight. He searched for food in the rubbish heap where the dogs
were eating crumbs from the discarded leaf-plates. Now and then he pushed the dogs
aside to get his crumbs. The dogs didn't mind either. Haladhāri followed him and asked:
'Who are you? Are you a purnajnani?' The madman whispered, 'Sh! Yes, I am a
purnajnani.' My heart began to palpitate as Haladhāri told me about it. I clung to Hriday.
I said to the Divine Mother, 'Mother, shall I too have to pass through such a state?' We
all went to see the man. He spoke words of great wisdom to us but behaved like a
madman before others. Haladhāri followed him a great way when he left the garden.
After passing the gate he said to Haladhāri: 'What else shall I say to you? When you no
longer make any distinction between the water of this pool and the water of the Ganges,
then you will know that you have Perfect Knowledge.' Saying this he walked rapidly
away."
Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with M. Other devotees, too, were present.
MASTER (to M.): "How do you feel about Shashadhar?"
M: "He is very nice."
MASTER: "He is very intelligent, isn't he?"
M: "Yes, sir. He is very erudite."
MASTER: "According to the Gitā there is a power of God in one who is respected and
honoured by many. But Shashadhar has still a few things to do.
531What will he accomplish with mere scholarship? He needs to practise some austerity. It
is necessary to practise some spiritual discipline.
"Gauri Pundit practised austerity. When he chanted a hymn to the Divine Mother, the
other pundits would seem no more than earthworms.
"Narayan Shastri was not merely a scholar, either. He practised sadhana as well. He
studied for twenty-five years without a break. Nyaya alone, he studied for seven years.
Still he would go into ecstasy while repeating the name of Śiva. The King of Jaipur
wanted to make him his court pundit, but Narayan refused. He used to spend much time
here. He had a great desire to go to the Vasishtha Āśrama to practise tapasya. He often
spoke to me about it, but I forbade him to go there. At that he said: 'Who knows when I
shall die? When shall I practise sadhana? Any day I may crack.' After much insistence on
his part I let him go. Some say that he is dead, that he died while practising austerity.
Others say that he is still alive and that they saw him off on a railway train.
Master and Keshab
"Before meeting Keshab, I asked Narayan Shastri to visit him and tell me what he
thought of him. Narayan reported that Keshab was an adept in japa. He knew astrology
and remarked that Keshab had been born under a good star. Then I went to visit Keshab
in the garden house at Belgharia. Hriday was with me. The moment I saw Keshab, I
said: 'Of all the people I see here, he alone has dropped his tail. He can now live on land
as well as in water, like a frog.'
"Keshab sent three members of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden at
Dakshineswar to test me. Prasanna was one of them. They were commissioned to watch
me day and night, and to report to Keshab. They were in my room and intended to
spend the night there. They constantly uttered the word 'Dayamaya' and said to me:
'Follow Keshab Babu. That will do you good.' I said, 'I believe in God with form.' Still
they went on with their exclamations of 'Dayamaya!' Then a strange mood came over
me. I said to them, 'Get out of here!' I didn't allow them to spend the night in my room.
So they slept on the verandah. Captain also spent the night in the temple garden the
first time he visited me.
"Michael visited the temple garden when Narayan Shastri was living with me. Dwarika
Babu, Mathur's eldest son, brought him here. The owners of the temple garden were
about to get into a lawsuit with the English proprietors of the neighbouring powder
magazine; so they wanted Michael's advice. I met him in the big room next to the
manager's office. Narayan Shastri was with me. I asked Narayan to talk to him. Michael
couldn't talk very well in Sanskrit. He made mistakes. Then they talked in the popular
dialect. Narayan Shastri asked him his reason for giving up the Hindu religion. Pointing
to his stomach, Michael said, 'It was for this.' Narayan said, 'What shall I say to a man
who gives up his religion for his belly's sake?' Thereupon Michael asked me to say
something. I said: 'I don't know why, but I don't feel like saying anything. Someone
seems to be pressing my tongue.' "
532MANOMOHAN: "Mr. Choudhury will not come. He said: 'That fellow Shashadhar from
Faridpur will be there. I shall not go.' "
Mr. Choudhury had obtained his Master's degree from Calcutta University. He drew a
salary of three or four hundred rupees. After the death of his first wife he had felt
intense dispassion for the world, but after some time he had married again. He
frequently visited the Master at the temple garden.
MASTER: "How mean of him! He is vain of his scholarship. Besides, he has married a
second time. He looks on the world as a mere mud-puddle.
(To the devotees) "This attachment to 'woman and gold' makes a man small-minded.
When I first saw Haramohan he had many good traits. I longed to see him. He was then
seventeen or eighteen years old. I used to send for him every now and then, but he
wouldn't come. He is now living away from the family with his wife. He had been living
with his uncle before. That was very good. He had no worldly troubles. Now he has a
separate home and does the marketing for his wife daily. The other day he came to
Dakshineswar. I said to him: 'Go away. Leave this place. I don't even feel like touching
you.' "
Sri Ramakrishna went to the inner apartments to see the Deity. He offered some flowers.
The ladies of Balarām's family were pleased to see him.
The Master came back to the drawing-room and said: "The worldly minded practise
devotions, japa, and austerity only by fits and starts. But those who know nothing else
but God repeat His name with every breath. Some always repeat mentally, 'Om Rāma'.
Even the followers of the path of knowledge repeat, 'Soham', 'I am He'. There are others
whose tongues are always moving, repeating the name of God. One should remember
and think of God constantly."
Pundit Shashadhar entered the room with one or two friends and saluted the Master.
MASTER (smiling): "We are like the bridesmaids waiting near the bed for the arrival of
the groom."
The pundit laughed. The room was filled with devotees, among them Dr.Pratap and
Balarām's father. The Master continued his talk.
MASTER (to Shashadhar): "The first sign of knowledge is a peaceful nature, and the
second is absence of egotism. You have both. There are other indications of a Jnāni. He
shows intense dispassion in the presence of a sādhu, is a lion when at work, for instance,
when he lectures, and is full of wit before his wife. (All laugh.)
"But the nature of the vijnāni is quite different, as was the case with Chaitanyadeva. He
acts like a child or a madman or an inert thing or a ghoul. While in the mood of a child,
he sometimes shows childlike guilelessness, sometimes the frivolity of adolescence, and
sometimes, while instructing others, the strength of a young man."
533Three kinds of bhakti
PUNDIT: "By what kind of bhakti does one realize God?"
MASTER: "Three kinds of bhakti are found, according to the nature of the man: sattvic
bhakti, rajasic bhakti, and tamasic bhakti.
"Sattvic bhakti is known to God alone. It makes no outward display. A man with such
devotion loves privacy. Perhaps he meditates inside the mosquito net, where nobody
sees him. When this kind of devotion is awakened, one hasn't long to wait for the vision
of God. The appearance of the dawn in the east shows that the sun will rise before long.
"A man with rajasic bhakti feels like making a display of his devotion before others. He
worships the Deity with 'sixteen ingredients', enters the temple wearing a silk cloth, and
puts around his neck a string of rudrāksha beads interspersed here and there with beads
of gold and ruby.
"A man with tamasic bhakti shows the courage and boisterousness of a highway robber.
A highway robber goes on his expedition openly, shouting, 'Kill! Plunder!' He isn't afraid
even of eight police inspectors. The devotee with tamasic bhakti also shouts like a
madman:'Hara! Hara! Vyom! Vyom! Victory to Kāli!' He has great strength of mind and
burning faith.
"A Sakta has such faith. He says: 'What? I have uttered once the name of Kāli and of
Durga! I have uttered once the name of Rāma! Can there be any sin in me?'
"The Vaishnavas have a very humble and lowly attitude. (Looking at Balarām's father)
They tell their rosary and whine and whimper: 'O Krishna, be gracious to us! We are
wretched! We are sinners!'
Faith in God's name
"A man should have such fiery faith as to be able to say, 'I have uttered the name of
God; how can I be a sinner?' Imagine a man repeating the name of Hari day and night
and at the same time saying that he is a sinner!"
So saying, Sri Ramakrishna became overwhelmed with divine ecstasy and sang:
If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name,
How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,
Withhold from me deliverance,
Wretched though I may be?
I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,
Or slain a woman or a cow,
Or even caused a brahmin's death;
But, though it all be true,
Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;
For through the power of Thy sweet name
534My wretched soul may still aspire
Even to Brahmanhood.
He sang again:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!
Drunk with a draught of celestial wine, She reels, and yet She
does not fall.
Erect She stands on Śiva's bosom, and the earth trembles under
Her tread;
She and Her Lord are mad with frenzy, casting aside all fear
and shame!
Pundit Shashadhar was weeping. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, sang:
O tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga!
Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress?
Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world;
From Thee have the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Śiva sprung.
The ten Embodiments of Divine Śakti art Thou,
And Thou the ten Avatars: this time, save me Thou must!
The moving and the unmoving, the gross and the subtle, art
Thou;
Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution.
Thou art the Primal Root of this manifold universe;
The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou;
Thou art the Śakti of all, and Thou Thine own Śakti, too.
As the Master listened to the last few lines, he went into an ecstatic mood. The Master
himself sang:
O Mother, for Yaśoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called
Thee her precious "Blue Jewel";
Where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, O terrible Syama?
Dance that way once for me, O Mother! Throw down Thy
sword and take the flute;
Cast off Thy garland of heads, and wear Thy wild-flower
garland.
If without Śiva Thou canst not dance, then let Balarama be Thy
Śiva.
Dance, O Syama, as Thou didst dance when Thou wert
Krishna!
Mother, play on Thy flute again, once so full of delight for the
gopis;
Play again on Thy magic flute, which called the cattle in from
the pasture,
Stopping the Jamuna's murmuring flow and turning it
535backward.
Hot in the sky the sun would burn, when Yaśoda, restless for
her Krishna,
Fondly would call: "Here, my Gopala! Cream and butter-eat
them, my Darling!"
And she would comb His long black hair and carefully braid
it.
Bending Thy supple body, Mother, both at the neck, the waist,
and the knee,
Thou didst dance with Thy friend Sridāmā, while Thy two
anklets played the music:
Ta-thaia! Ta-thaia! Ta-ta! Thaia-thaia!
Hearing their captivating sound, the gopis would rush there.
Again Pundit Shashadhar shed tears of love.
Sri Ramakrishna came down to consciousness of the world. Pointing to Shashadhar, he
said to M., "Why don't you prod him?" He wanted M. or some other devotee to ask
Shashadhar a question.
RAMDAYAL (to Shashadhar): "The scriptures speak of Brahman's form as a projection of
mind. Who is it that projects?"
SHASHADHAR: "It is Brahman Itself that does so. It is no projection of a man's mind."
PRATAP: "Why does Brahman project the form?"
MASTER: "You ask why? Brahman doesn't act in consultation with others. It is Brahman's
pleasure. Brahman is self-willed. Why should we try to know the reason for Brahman's
acting this way or that? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Eat the
mangoes. What is the good of calculating how many trees there are in the orchard, how
many thousands of branches, and how many millions of leaves? One cannot realize Truth
by futile arguments and reasoning."
PRATAP: "Shouldn't we reason any more then?"
MASTER: "I am asking you not to indulge in futile reasoning. But reason, by all means,
about the Real and the unreal, about what is permanent and what is transitory. You
must reason when you are overcome by lust, anger, or grief."
SHASHADHAR: "That is different. It is called reasoning based on discrimination."
MASTER: "Yes, discrimination between the Real and the unreal."
All sat in silence. Again the Master spoke, addressing the pundit.
MASTER: "Formerly many great men used to come here."
536SHASHADHAR: "You mean rich people?"
MASTER: "No. Great scholars."
In the mean time the small car of Jagannath had been brought to the verandah. Inside
the car were the images of Krishna, Balarama, and Subhadra. They were adorned with
flowers, garlands, jewelry, and yellow apparel. Balarām was a sattvic worshipper: there
was no outward grandeur in his worship. Outsiders did not even know of this Car Festival
at his house. The Master and the devotees went to the verandah. Sri Ramakrishna pulled
the car by the rope. Then he began to sing:
See how all Nadia is shaking
Under the waves of Gaurānga's love. . . .
He sang again:
Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting
Hari's name,
The brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari's
love. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. The musician and his party joined the Master
in the music and dancing. Soon the whole verandah was filled with people. The ladies
witnessed this scene of joy from an adjoining room. It appeared as if Chaitanya himself
were dancing with his devotees, intoxicated with divine love.
It was not yet dusk. Sri Ramakrishna returned to the drawing-room with the devotees.
MASTER (to Shashadhar): "This is called bhajanananda, the bliss of devotees in the
worship of God. Worldly people keep themselves engrossed in the joy of sensuous
objects, of 'woman and gold'. Through worship devotees receive the grace of God, and
then His vision. Then they enjoy Brahmananda, the Bliss of Brahman."
Shashadhar and the devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.
SHASHADHAR (humbly): "Sir, please tell us what kind of yearning gives one this blissful
state of mind."
MASTER: "One feels restless for God when one's soul longs for His vision. The guru said
to the disciple: 'Come with me. I shall show you what kind of longing will enable you to
see God.' Saying this, he took the disciple to a pond and pressed his head under the
water. After a few moments he released the disciple and asked, 'How did you feel?' The
disciple answered: 'Oh, I felt as if I were dying! I was longing for a breath of air.' "
SHASHADHAR: "Yes! Yes! That's it. I understand it now."
MASTER: "To love God is the essence of the whole thing. Bhakti alone is the essence.
Nārada said to Rāma, 'May I always have pure love for Your Lotus Feet; and may I not
537be deluded by Your world-bewitching māyā!' Rāma said to him, 'Ask for some other
boon.' 'No,' said Nārada, 'I don't want anything else. May I have love for Your Lotus
Feet. This is my only prayer.' "
Pundit Shashadhar was ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked a devotee to bring a
carriage for the pundit.
SHASHADHAR: "Don't trouble yourself. I shall walk."
MASTER (smiling): "Oh, how can that be? 'You are beyond the reach of even Brahma's
meditation.' "
SHASHADHAR: "There is no particular need of my going just now. The only thing is that
I shall have to perform my sandhya."
MASTER: "The Divine Mother has taken away my sandhya and other devotions. The
purpose of the sandhya is to purify body and mind. I am no longer in that state."
The Master sang the following lines of a song:
When will you learn to lie, O mind, in the abode of Blessedness,
With Cleanliness and Defilement on either side of you?
Only when you have found the way
To keep these wives contentedly under a single roof,
Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama.
Pundit Shashadhar saluted the Master and went away.
RAM: "I visited Shashadhar yesterday. You asked me to."
MASTER: "Did I? I don't remember. But it is nice that you went."
RAM: "The editor of a newspaper was abusing you."
MASTER: "Suppose he was. What does it matter?"
RAM: "Please listen. Then I began to talk to the editor about you. He wanted to hear
more and wouldn't let me go."
It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna began to chant the names of the Divine Mother, Krishna,
Rāma, and Hari. The devotees sat in silence. The Master chanted the names in such
sweet tones that the hearts of the devotees were deeply touched. That day Balarām's
house was like Navadvip when Chaitanya lived there. On the verandah it was like
Navadvip, and in the parlour it was like Vrindāvan.
538That same night Sri Ramakrishna was to go to Dakshineswar. Balarām took him into the
inner apartments and served him with refreshments. The ladies of the family saluted the
Master.
The devotees were singing kirtan in the drawing-room, awaiting the Master's coming.
Presently Sri Ramakrishna came and joined the singers.
The kirtan went on:
Behold, my Gora is dancing! With the devotees
He dances in Srivas's courtyard, singing the kirtan.
Gora says to all, "Repeat the name of Hari!"
He looks at Gadadhar, and from his red eyes
Are flowing tears of love over his golden body.
The Master improvised the lines:
Gora is dancing in the kirtan:
There he dances, Sachi's darling!
There he dances, my Gaurānga!
There he dances, my soul's beloved!
