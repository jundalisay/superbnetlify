Saturday, February 2, 1884

IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna had been conversing with Rākhāl , Mahimacharan, Hazra, and other devotees, when M. entered the room and saluted him. He brought with him splint, pad, and lint to bandage the Master's injured arm.


## Master's injured arm

One day, while going toward the pine-grove, Sri Ramakrishna had fallen near the railing and dislocated a bone in his left arm. He had been in an ecstatic mood at the time and
no one had been with him. 

MASTER (to M.): "Hello! What was ailing you? Are you quite well now?"

M: "Yes, sir, I am all right now."

MASTER (to Mahima): "Well, if I am the machine and God is its operator, then why should this have happened to me?"

The Master was sitting on the couch, listening to the story of Mahimacharan's pilgrimage. Mahima had visited several holy places twelve years before.

MAHlMA: "I found a brahmachari in a garden at Sicrole in Benares. He said he had been living there for twenty years but did not know its owner. He asked me if I worked in an
office. On my answering in the negative, he said, 'Then are you a wandering holy man?'

I saw a sādhu on the bank of the Narmada. He repeated the Gayatri mentally. It so thrilled him that the hair on his body stood on end. And when he repeated the Gayatri
and Om aloud, it thrilled those who sat near him and caused their hair to stand on end."

The Master was in the mood of a child. Being hungry he said to M., "What have you brought for me?" Looking at Rākhāl he went into samādhi.

He was gradually coming down to the normal plane. To bring his mind back to the consciousness of the body, he said: "I shall eat some jilipi. I shall drink some water."
Weeping like a child, he said to the Divine Mother: "O Brahmamayi! O Mother! Why hast Thou done this to me? My arm is badly hurt. (To the devotees) Will I be all right again?"
They consoled him, as one would a child, and said: "Surely. You will be quite well again."

MASTER (to Rākhāl): "You aren't to blame for it, though you are living here to look after me; for even if you had accompanied me, you certainly wouldn't have gone up to the
railing."

The Master again went into a spiritual mood and said: "Om! Om! Om! Mother, what is this that I am saying? Don't make me unconscious, Mother, with the Knowledge of
Brahman. Don't give me Brahmajnana. I am but Thy child. I am easily worried and frightened. I want a Mother. A million salutations to the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it
to those who seek it. O Ānandamayi! O Blissful Mother!"

Uttering loudly the word "Ānandamayi", he burst into tears and said:

Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart.

That even with Thee for Mother, and though I am wide awake,

There should be robbery in my house.

Again he said to the Divine Mother: "What wrong have I done, Mother? Do I ever do anything? It is Thou, Mother, who doest everything. I am the machine and Thou art its
Operator.

(To Rākhāl, smiling) "See that you don't fall! Don't be piqued and cheat yourself."

Again addressing the Mother, Sri Ramakrishna said: "Do I weep because I am hurt? Not at all:

Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart,
That even with Thee for Mother, and though I am wide awake,
There should be robbery in my house."
The Master was again talking and laughing, like a child who, though ailing, sometimes
forgets his illness and laughs and plays about.
MASTER (to the devotees): "It will avail you nothing unless you realize Satchidananda.
There is nothing like discrimination and renunciation. The worldly man's devotion to God
is momentary―like a drop of water on a redhot frying-pan. Perchance he looks at a
flower and exclaims, 'Ah, what a wonderful creation of God!'
Yearning for God
"One must be restless for God. If a son clamours persistently for his share of the
property, his parents consult with each other and give it to him even though he is a
minor. God will certainly listen to your prayers if you feel restless for Him. Since He has
begotten us, surely we can claim our inheritance from Him. He is our own Father, our
own Mother. We can force our demand on Him. We can say to him, 'Reveal Thyself to
me or I shall cut my throat with a knife!' "
Sri Ramakrishna taught the devotees how to call on the Divine Mother.


MASTER: "I used to pray to Her in this way: 'O Mother! O Blissful One! Reveal Thyself to me. Thou must!' Again, I would say to Her: 'O Lord of the lowly! O Lord of the universe! 

Surely I am not outside Thy universe. I am bereft of knowledge. I am without discipline. I have no devotion. I know nothing. Thou must be gracious and reveal
Thyself to me.'

Thus the Master taught the devotees how to pray. They were deeply touched. Tears filled Mahimacharan's eyes.

Sri Ramakrishna looked at him and sang:

Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, O mind!

And how can She hold Herself from you?

How can Syama stay away?

Several devotees arrived from Shibpur. Since they had come from a great distance the
Master could not disappoint them. He told them some of the essentials of spiritual life.

MASTER: "God alone is real, and all else illusory. The garden and its owner. God and His splendour. But people look at the garden only. How few seek out the owner!"
Prayer and discrimination

A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the way?"

MASTER: "Discrimination between the Real and the unreal. One should always discriminate to the effect that God alone is real and the world unreal. And one should pray with sincere longing."

DEVOTEE: "But, sir, where is our leisure for these things?"

MASTER: "Those who have the time must meditate and worship. But those who cannot possibly do so must bow down whole-heartedly to God twice a day. He abides in the
hearts of all; He knows that worldly people have many things to do. What else is possible for them? You don't have time to pray to God; therefore give Him the power of
attorney. But all is in vain unless you attain God and see Him."

ANOTHER DEVOTEE: "Sir, to see you is the same as to see God."

MASTER: "Don't ever say that again. The waves belong to the Ganges, not the Ganges to the waves. A man cannot realize God unless he gets rid of all such egotistic ideas as
'I am such an important man' or 'I am so and so'. Level the mound of 'I' to the ground by dissolving it with tears of devotion."

DEVOTEE: "Why has God put us in the world?"

MASTER: "To perpetuate His creation. It is His will, His maya. He has deluded man with 'woman and gold'."

DEVOTEE: "Why has He deluded us? Why has He so willed?"

MASTER: "If but once He should give man a taste of divine joy, then man would not care to lead a worldly life. The creation would come to an end.
"The grain-dealer stores rice in huge bags in his warehouse. Near them he puts some puffed rice in a tray. This is to keep the rats away. The puffed rice tastes sweet to the
rats and they nibble at it all night; they do not seek the rice itself. But just think! One seer of rice yields fourteen seers of puffed rice. How infinitely superior is the joy of God to the pleasure of 'woman and gold'! To one who thinks of the beauty of God, the beauty
of even Rambha and Tilottama appears as but the ashes of a funeral pyre."

DEVOTEE: "Why do we not feel intense restlessness to realize Him?"

MASTER: "A man does not feel restless for God until all his worldly desires are satisfied. He does not remember the Mother of the Universe until his share of the enjoyment of
'woman and gold' is completed. A child absorbed in play does not seek his mother. But after his play is over, he says, 'Mother! I must go to my mother.' Hriday's son was
playing with the pigeons, calling to them, 'Come! Ti, ti!' When he had had enough of play he began to cry. Then a stranger came and said: 'Come with me. I will take you to your mother.' 

Unhesitatingly he climbed on the man's shoulders and was off.
"Those who are eternally free do not have to enter worldly life.
enjoyment has been satisfied with their very birth."

At 5PM, Dr. Madhusudan arrived. While he prepared the bandage for the Master's arm, Sri Ramakrishna laughed like a child and said, "You are
the Madhusudan of both this world and the next!"

DR. MADHUSUDAN (smiling): "I only labour under the weight of my name."

MASTER (smiling): "Why, is the name a trifling thing? God is not different from His name. Satyabhama tried to balance Krishna with gold and precious stones, but could
not do it. Then Rukmini put a tulsi-leaf with the name of Krishna on the scales. That balanced the Lord."
The doctor was ready to bandage the Master's arm. A bed was spread on the floor and the Master, laughing, lay down upon it. He said, intoning the words: "Ah! This is
Radha's final stage. But Brinde says, 'Who knows what is yet to be?' "

The devotees were sitting around the Master. He sang:

The gopis all were gathered about the shore of the lake.

Sri Ramakrishna laughed and the devotees laughed with him.
After his arm was bandaged he said: "I haven't very much faith in your Calcutta
physicians. When Sambhu became delirious, Dr. Sarvadhikari said: 'Oh, it is nothing.
It is just grogginess from the medicine. And a little while after, Sambhu breathed his
last."
It was evening and the worship in the temples was over. A few minutes later Adhar
arrived from Calcutta to see the Master. Mahimacharan, Rākhāl , and M. were in the
room.

ADHAR: "How are you?"

MASTER (affectionately): "Look here. How my arm hurts! (Smiling) You don't have to ask how I am!"

Adhar sat on the floor with the devotees. The Master said to him, "Please stroke here gently." Adhar sat on the end of the couch and gently stroked Sri Ramakrishna's feet.
The Master conversed with Mahimācharan.

MASTER: "It will be very good if you can practise unselfish love for God. A man who has such love says: 'O Lord, I do not seek salvation, fame, wealth, or cure of disease. None of these do I seek. I want only Thee.' Many are the people who come to a rich man with
various desires. 

But if someone comes to him simply out of love, not wanting any favour, then the rich man feels attracted to him. Prahlada had this unselfish love, this
pure love for God without any worldly end."

Mahimacharan sat silent. The Master turned to him.

MASTER: "Now let me tell you something that will agree with your mood. According to the Vedānta one has to know the real nature of one's own Self. But such knowledge is
impossible without the renunciation of ego. The ego is like a stick that seems to divide the water in two. It makes you feel that you are one and I am another. When the ego
disappears in samādhi, then one knows Brahman to be one's own inner consciousness.

"One must renounce the 'I' that makes one feel, 'I am Mahima Chakravarty', 'I am a learned man', and so on. But the 'ego of Knowledge' does not injure one.
Sankaracharya retained the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach mankind.


## Lust

"One cannot obtain the Knowledge of Brahman unless one is extremely cautious about women. Therefore it is very difficult for those who live in the world to get such
Knowledge. However clever you may be, you will stain your body if you live in a sooty
room. The company of a young woman evokes lust even in a lustless man.
408"But it is not so harmful for a householder who follows the path of knowledge to enjoy
conjugal happiness with his own wife now and then. He may satisfy his sexual impulse
like any other natural impulse. Yes, you may enjoy a sweetmeat once in a while.
(Mahimacharan laughs.) It is not so harmful for a householder.
Hard discipline for sannyasi

But it is extremely harmful for a sannyasi. He must not look even at the portrait of a woman. A monk enjoying a woman is like a man swallowing the spittle he has already
spat out. A sannyasi must not sit near a woman and talk to her, even if she is intensely pious. No, he must not talk to a woman even though he may have controlled his
passion.

A sannyasi must renounce both 'woman' and 'gold'. As he must not look even at the portrait of a woman, so also he must not touch gold, that is to say, money. It is bad for
him even to keep money near him, for it brings in its train calculation, worry, insolence,
anger, and such evils. There is an instance in the sun: it shines brightly; suddenly a
cloud appears and hides it.

"That is why I didn't agree to the Mārwāri's depositing money for me with Hriday. I said: 'No, I won't allow even that. If I keep money near me, it will certainly raise
clouds.'

"Why all these strict rules for a sannyasi? It is for the welfare of mankind as well as for
his own good. A sannyasi may himself lead an unattached life and may have controlled
his passion, but he must renounce 'woman and gold' to set an example to the world.
"A man will have the courage to practise renunciation if he sees one hundred percent
renunciation in a sannyasi. Then only will he try to give up 'woman and gold'. If a
sannyasi does not set this example, then who will?
"One may lead a householder's life after realizing God. It is like churning butter from
milk and then keeping the butter in water. Janaka led the life of a householder after
attaining Brahmajnana.
"Janaka fenced with two swords, the one of jnāna and the other of karma. The sannyasi
renounces action; therefore he fences with one sword only, that of knowledge. A
householder, endowed with knowledge like Janaka's, can enjoy fruit both from the tree
and from the ground. He can serve holy men, entertain guests, and do other things like
that. I said to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, I don't want to be a dry sādhu.'
"After attaining Brahmajnana one does not have to discriminate even about food. The
rishis of olden times, endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman and having experienced
divine bliss, ate everything, even pork.
(To Mahima) "Generally speaking there are two kinds of yoga: karmayoga and
manoyoga, that is to say, union with God through work and through the mind.
