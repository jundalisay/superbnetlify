Sri Ramakrishna was born at Kāmārpukur, a village in the Hooghly District in rural Bengāl. 

It was far from the railway, untouched by the city. It contained rice-fields, tall palms, royal banyans, a few lakes, and two cremation
grounds. 

South of the village a stream took its leisurely course. A mango orchard dedicated by a neighbouring zamindār to the public use was frequented by the boys for
their noonday sports. A highway passed through the village to the great temple of Jagannāth at Puri, and the villagers, most of whom were farmers and craftsmen,
entertained many passing holy men and pilgrims. The dull round of the rural life was broken by lively festivals, the observance of sacred days, religious singing, and other
innocent pleasures.

About his parents Sri Ramakrishna once said: "My mother was the personification of rectitude and gentleness. She did not know much about the ways of the world; innocent
of the art of concealment, she would say what was in her mind. People loved her for open-heartedness. My father, an orthodox brāhmin, never accepted gifts from the
Śudrās. He spent much of his time in worship and meditation, and in repeating God's name and chanting His glories. Whenever in his daily prayers he invoked the Goddess
Gāyatri, his chest flushed and tears rolled down his cheeks. He spent his leisure hours making garlands for the Family Deity, Raghuvir."
Khudirām Chattopādhyāya and Chandra Devi, the parents of Sri Ramakrishna, were married in 1799. At that time Khudirām was living in his ancestral village of Derepore,
not far from Kāmārpukur. 

Their first son, Rāmkumār, was born in 1805, and their first daughter, Kātyāyani, in 1810. In 1814 Khudirām was ordered by his landlord to bear
false witness in court against a neighbour. When he refused to do so, the landlord
brought a false case against him and deprived him of his ancestral property. Thus
dispossessed, he arrived, at the invitation of another landlord, in the quiet village of
Kāmārpukur, where he was given a dwelling and about an acre of fertile land. The crops
from this little property were enough to meet his family's simple needs. Here he lived in
simplicity, dignity, and contentment.
Ten years after his coming to Kāmārpukur, Khudirām made a pilgrimage on foot to
Rāmeswar, at the southern extremity of India. Two years later was born his second son,
whom he named Rāmeśwar. Again in 1835, at the age of sixty, he made a pilgrimage,
this time to Gayā. Here, from ancient times, Hindus have come from the four corners of
India to discharge their duties to their departed ancestors by offering them food and
drink at the sacred footprint of the Lord Vishnu. At this holy place Khudirām had a dream
in which the Lord Vishnu promised to be born as his son. And Chandrā Devi, too, in front
of the Śiva temple at Kāmārpukur, had a vision indicating the birth of a divine child.
Upon his return the husband found that she had conceived.
17It was on February 18, 1836, that the child, to be known afterwards as Ramakrishna,
was born. In memory of the dream at Gayā he was given the name of Gadādhar, the
"Bearer of the Mace", an epithet of Vishnu. Three years later a little sister was born.
Boyhood
Gadādhar grew up into a healthy and restless boy, full of fun and sweet mischief. He was
intelligent and precocious and endowed with a prodigious memory. On his father's lap he
learnt by heart the names of his ancestors and the hymns to the gods and goddesses,
and at the village school he was taught to read and write. But his greatest delight was to
listen to recitations of stories from Hindu mythology and the epics. These he would
afterwards recount from memory, to the great joy of the villagers. Painting he enjoyed;
the art of moulding images of the gods and goddesses he learnt from the potters. But
arithmetic was his great aversion.
At the age of six or seven Gadādhar had his first experience of spiritual ecstasy. One day
in June or July, when he was walking along a narrow path between paddy-fields, eating
the puffed rice that he carried in a basket, he looked up at the sky and saw a beautiful,
dark thunder-cloud. As it spread, rapidly enveloping the whole sky, a flight of snow-
white cranes passed in front of it. The beauty of the contrast overwhelmed the boy. He
fell to the ground, unconscious, and the puffed rice went in all directions. Some villagers
found him and carried him home in their arms. Gadādhar said later that in that state he
had experienced an indescribable joy.
Gadādhar was seven years old when his father died. This incident profoundly affected
him. For the first time the boy realized that life on earth was impermanent. Unobserved
by others, he began to slip into the mango orchard or into one of the cremation grounds,
and he spent hours absorbed in his own thoughts. He also became more helpful to his
mother in the discharge of her household duties. He gave more attention to reading and
hearing the religious stories recorded in the Purānās. And he became interested in the
wandering monks and pious pilgrims who would stop at Kāmārpukur on their way to
Puri. These holy men, the custodians of India's spiritual heritage and the living witnesses
of the ideal of renunciation of the world and all-absorbing love of God, entertained the
little boy with stories from the Hindu epics, stories of saints and prophets, and also
stories of their own adventures. He, on his part, fetched their water and fuel and served
them in various ways. Meanwhile, he was observing their meditation and worship.
At the age of nine, Gadādhar was invested with the Sacred Thread. This ceremony
conferred upon him the privileges of his brāhmin lineage, including the worship of the
Family Deity, Raghuvir, and imposed upon him the many strict disciplines of a brāhmin's
life. During the ceremony of investiture he shocked his relatives by accepting a meal
cooked by his nurse, a Śudrā woman. His father would never have dreamt of doing such
a thing. But in a playful mood Gadādhar had once promised this woman that he would
eat her food, and now he fulfilled his plighted word. The woman had piety and religious
sincerity, and these were more important to the boy than the conventions of society.
18Gadādhar was now permitted to worship Raghuvir. Thus began his first training in
meditation. He so gave his heart and soul to the worship that the stone image very soon
appeared to him as the living Lord of the Universe. His tendency to lose himself in
contemplation was first noticed at this time. Behind his boyish light-heartedness was
seen a deepening of his spiritual nature.
About this time, on the Śivarātri night, consecrated to the worship of Śiva, a dramatic
performance was arranged. The principal actor, who was to play the part of Śiva,
suddenly fell ill, and Gadādhar was persuaded to act in his place. While friends were
dressing him for the role of Śiva - smearing his body with ashes, matting his locks,
placing a trident in his hand and a string of rudrākaśa beads around his neck - the boy
appeared to become absent-minded. He approached the stage with slow and measured
step, supported by his friends. He looked the living image of Śiva. The audience loudly
applauded what it took to be his skill as an actor, but it was soon discovered that he was
really lost in meditation. His countenance was radiant and tears flowed from his eyes. He
was lost to the outer world. The effect of this scene on the audience was tremendous.
The people felt blessed as by a vision of Śiva Himself. The performance had to be
stopped, and the boy's mood lasted till the following morning.
Gadādhar himself now organized a dramatic company with his young friends. The stage
was set in the mango orchard. The themes were selected from the stories of the
Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Gadādhar knew by heart almost all the roles, having
heard them from professional actors. His favourite theme was the Vrindāvan episode of
Krishna's life, depicting those exquisite love-stories of Krishna and the milkmaids and the
cowherd boys. Gadādhar would play the parts of Rādhā or Krishna and would often lose
himself in the character he was portraying. His natural feminine grace heightened the
dramatic effect. The mango orchard would ring with the loud kirtan of the boys. Lost in
song and merry-making, Gadādhar became indifferent to the routine of school.
In 1849 Rāmkumār, the eldest son, went to Calcutta to improve the financial condition of
the family.
Gadādhar was on the threshold of youth. He had become the pet of the women of the
village. They loved to hear him talk, sing, or recite from the holy books. They enjoyed
his knack of imitating voices. Their woman's instinct recognized the innate purity and
guilelessness of this boy of clear skin, flowing hair, beaming eyes, smiling face, and
inexhaustible fun. The pious elderly women looked upon him as Gopālā, the Baby
Krishna, and the younger ones saw in him the youthful Krishna of Vrindāvan. He himself
so idealised the love of the gopis for Krishna that he sometimes yearned to be born as a
woman, if he must be born again, in order to be able to love Sri Krishna with all his
heart and soul.
Coming to Calcutta
At the age of sixteen Gadādhar was summoned to Calcutta by his elder brother
Rāmkumār, who wished assistance in his priestly duties. Rāmkumār had opened a
Sanskrit academy to supplement his income, and it was his intention gradually to turn
19his younger brother's mind to education. Gadādhar applied himself heart and soul to his
new duty as family priest to a number of Calcutta families. His worship was very
different from that of the professional priests. He spent hours decorating the images and
singing hymns and devotional songs; he performed with love the other duties of his
office. People were impressed with his ardour. But to his studies he paid scant attention.
Rāmkumār did not at first oppose the ways of his temperamental brother. He wanted
Gadādhar to become used to the conditions of city life. But one day he decided to warn
the boy about his indifference to the world. After all, in the near future Gadādhar must,
as a householder, earn his livelihood through the performance of his brāhminical duties;
and these required a thorough knowledge of Hindu law, astrology, and kindred subjects.
He gently admonished Gadādhar and asked him to pay more attention to his studies. But
the boy replied spiritedly: "Brother, what shall I do with a mere bread-winning
education? I would rather acquire that wisdom which will illumine my heart and give me
satisfaction for ever."
Bread-winning Education
The anguish of the inner soul of India found expression through these passionate words
of the young Gadādhar. For what did his unsophisticated eyes see around him in
Calcutta, at that time the metropolis of India and the centre of modern culture and
learning? Greed and lust held sway in the higher levels of society, and the occasional
religious practices were merely outer forms from which the soul had long ago departed.
Gadādhar had never seen anything like this at Kāmārpukur among the simple and pious
villagers. The sādhus and wandering monks whom he had served in his boyhood had
revealed to him an altogether different India. He had been impressed by their devotion
and purity, their self-control and renunciation. He had learnt from them and from his
own intuition that the ideal of life as taught by the ancient sages of India was the
realization of God.
When Rāmkumār reprimanded Gadādhar for neglecting a "bread-winning education", the
inner voice of the boy reminded him that the legacy of his ancestors - the legacy of
Rāmā, Krishna, Buddha, Sankara, Rāmānuja, Chaitanya - was not worldly security but
the Knowledge of God. And these noble sages were the true representatives of Hindu
society. Each of them was seated, as it were, on the crest of the wave that followed each
successive trough in the tumultuous course of Indian national life. All demonstrated that
the life current of India is spirituality. This truth was revealed to Gadādhar through that
inner vision which scans past and future in one sweep, unobstructed by the barriers of
time and space. But he was unaware of the history of the profound change that had
taken place in the land of his birth during the previous one hundred years.
Hindu society during the eighteenth century had been passing through a period of
decadence. It was the twilight of the Mussalman rule. There were anarchy and confusion
in all spheres. Superstitious practices dominated the religious life of the people. Rites
and rituals passed for the essence of spirituality. Greedy priests became the custodians
of heaven. True philosophy was supplanted by dogmatic opinions. The pundits took
delight in vain polemics.
20In 1757 English traders laid the foundation of British rule in India. Gradually the
Government was systematized and lawlessness suppressed. The Hindus were much
impressed by the military power and political acumen of the new rulers. In the wake of
the merchants came the English educators, and social reformers, and Christian
missionaries - all bearing a culture completely alien to the Hindu mind. In different parts
of the country educational institutions were set up and Christian churches established.
Hindu young men were offered the heady wine of the Western culture of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they drank it to the very dregs.
The first effect of the draught on the educated Hindus was a complete effacement from
their minds of the time-honoured beliefs and traditions of Hindu society. They came to
believe that there was no transcendental Truth. The world perceived by the senses was
all that existed. God and religion were illusions of the untutored mind. True knowledge
could be derived only from the analysis of nature. So atheism and agnosticism became
the fashion of the day. The youth of India, taught in English schools, took malicious
delight in openly breaking the customs and traditions of their society. They would do
away with the caste-system and remove the discriminatory laws about food. Social
reform, the spread of secular education, widow remarriage, abolition of early marriage -
they considered these the panacea for the degenerate condition of Hindu society.
The Christian missionaries gave the finishing touch to the process of transformation.
They ridiculed as relics of a barbarous age the images and rituals of the Hindu religion.
They tried to persuade India that the teachings of her saints and seers were the cause of
her downfall, that her Vedas, Purānās, and other scriptures were filled with superstition.
Christianity, they maintained, had given the white races position and power in this world
and assurance of happiness in the next; therefore Christianity was the best of all
religions. Many intelligent young Hindus became converted. The man in the street was
confused. The majority of the educated grew materialistic in their mental outlook.
Everyone living near Calcutta or the other strongholds of Western culture, even those
who attempted to cling to the orthodox traditions of Hindu society, became infected by
the new uncertainties and the new beliefs.
But the soul of India was to be resuscitated through a spiritual awakening. We hear the
first call of this renascence in the spirited retort of the young Gadādhar: "Brother, what
shall I do with a mere bread-winning education?"
Rāmkumār could hardly understand the import of his young brother's reply. He described
in bright colours the happy and easy life of scholars in Calcutta society. But Gadādhar
intuitively felt that the scholars, to use one of his own vivid illustrations, were like so
many vultures, soaring high on the wings of their uninspired intellect, with their eyes
fixed on the charnel-pit of greed and lust. So he stood firm and Rāmkumār had to give
way.
Kāli Temple at Dakshineśwar
At that time there lived in Calcutta a rich widow named Rāni Rāsmani, belonging to the
Śudrā caste, and known far and wide not only for her business ability, courage, and
21intelligence, but also for her largeness of heart, piety, and devotion to God. She was
assisted in the management of her vast property by her son-in-law Mathur Mohan.
In 1847 the Rāni purchased twenty acres of land at Dakshineśwar, a village about four
miles north of Calcutta. Here she created a temple garden and constructed several
temples. Her Ishta, or Chosen Ideal, was the Divine Mother, Kāli.
The temple garden stands directly on the east bank of the Ganges. The northern section
of the land and a portion to the east contain an orchard, flower gardens, and two small
reservoirs. The southern section is paved with brick and mortar. The visitor arriving by
boat ascends the steps of an imposing bathing-Ghāt, which leads to the Chāndni, a
roofed terrace, on either side of which stand in a row six temples of Śiva. East of the
terrace and the Śiva temples is a large court, paved, rectangular in shape, and running
north and south. Two temples stand in the centre of this court, the larger one, to the
south and facing south, being dedicated to Kāli, and the smaller one, facing the Ganges,
to Radhākānta, that is, Krishna, the Consort of Rādhā. Nine domes with spires surmount
the temple of Kāli, and before it stands the spacious Natmandir, or music hall, the
terrace of which is supported by stately pillars. At the northwest and southwest corners
of the temple compound are two Nahabats, or music towers, from which music flows at
different times of day, especially at sunup, noon, and sundown, when the worship is
performed in the temples. Three sides of the paved courtyard -all except the west - are
lined with rooms set apart for kitchens, store-rooms, dining-rooms, and quarters for the
temple staff and guests. The chamber in the northwest angle, just beyond the last of the
Śiva temples, is of special interest to us; for here Sri Ramakrishna was to spend a
considerable part of his life. To the west of this chamber is a semicircular porch
overlooking the river. In front of the porch runs a foot-path, north and south, and
beyond the path is a large garden and, below the garden, the Ganges. The orchard to
the north of the buildings contains the Panchavati, the banyan, and the bel-tree,
associated with Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual practices. Outside and to the north of the
temple compound proper is the Kuthi, or bungalow, used by members of Rāni Rāsmani's
family visiting the garden. And north of the temple garden, separated from it by a high
wall, is a powder-magazine belonging to the British Government.
Śiva
In the twelve Śiva temples are installed the emblems of the Great God of renunciation in
His various aspects, worshipped daily with proper rites. Śiva requires few articles of
worship. White flowers and bel-leaves and a little Ganges water offered with devotion
are enough to satisfy the benign Deity and win from Him the boon of liberation.
Radhākānta
The temple of Radhākānta, also known as the temple of Vishnu, contains the images of
Rādhā and Krishna, the symbol of union with God through ecstatic love. The two images
stand on a pedestal facing the west. The floor is paved with marble. From the ceiling of
the porch hang chandeliers protected from dust by coverings of red cloth. Canvas
screens shield the images from the rays of the setting sun. Close to the threshold of the
22inner shrine is a small brass cup containing holy water. Devoted visitors reverently drink
a few drops from the vessel.
Kāli
The main temple is dedicated to Kāli, the Divine Mother, here worshipped as Bhavatārini,
the Saviour of the Universe. The floor of this temple also is paved with marble. The
basalt image of the Mother, dressed in gorgeous gold brocade, stands on a white marble
image of the prostrate body of Her Divine Consort, Śiva, the symbol of the Absolute. On
the feet of the Goddess are, among other ornaments, anklets of gold. Her arms are
decked with jeweled ornaments of gold. She wears necklaces of gold and pearls, a
golden garland of human heads, and a girdle of human arms. She wears a golden crown,
golden ear-rings, and a golden nose-ring with a pearl-drop. She has four arms. The
lower left hand holds a severed human head and the upper grips a blood-stained sabre.
One right hand offers boons to Her children; the other allays their fear. The majesty of
Her posture can hardly be described. It combines the terror of destruction with the
reassurance of motherly tenderness. For She is the Cosmic Power, the totality of the
universe, a glorious harmony of the pairs of opposites. She deals out death, as She
creates and preserves. She has three eyes, the third being the symbol of Divine
Wisdom; they strike dismay into the wicked, yet pour out affection for Her devotees.
The whole symbolic world is represented in the temple garden - the Trinity of the Nature
Mother (Kāli), the Absolute (Śiva), and Love (Radhākānta), the Arch spanning heaven
and earth. The terrific Goddess of the Tantra, the soul-enthralling Flute-Player of the
Bhāgavata, and the Self-absorbed Absolute of the Vedas live together, creating the
greatest synthesis of religions. All aspects of Reality are represented there. But of this
divine household, Kāli is the pivot, the sovereign Mistress. She is Prakriti, the
Procreatrix, Nature, the Destroyer, the Creator. Nay, She is something greater and
deeper still for those who have eyes to see. She is the Universal Mother, "my Mother" as
Ramakrishna would say, the All-powerful, who reveals Herself to Her children under
different aspects and Divine Incarnations, the Visible God, who leads the elect to the
Invisible Reality; and if it so pleases Her, She takes away the last trace of ego from
created beings and merges it in the consciousness of the Absolute, the undifferentiated
God. Through Her grace "the finite ego loses itself in the illimitable Ego-Ātman-
Brahman".
Rāni Rāsmani spent a fortune for the construction of the temple garden and another
fortune for its dedication ceremony, which took place on May 31, 1855.
Sri Ramakrishna - henceforth we shall call Gadādhar by this familiar name - came to the
temple garden with his elder brother Rāmkumār, who was appointed priest of the Ka1i
temple. Sri Ramakrishna did not at first approve of Rāmkumār's working for the Śudrā
Rāsmani. The example of their orthodox father was still fresh in Sri Ramakrishna's mind.
He objected also to the eating of the cooked offerings of the temple, since, according to
orthodox Hindu custom, such food can be offered to the Deity only in the house of a
brāhmin. But the holy atmosphere of the temple grounds, the solitude of the surrounding
wood, the loving care of his brother, the respect shown him by Rāni Rāsmani and Mathur
23Bābu, the living presence of the Goddess Kāli in the temple, and, above all, the
proximity of the sacred Ganges, which Sri Ramakrishna always held in the highest
respect, gradually overcame his disapproval, and he began to feel at home.
Within a very short time Sri Ramakrishna attracted the notice of Mathur Bābu, who was
impressed by the young man's religious fervour and wanted him to participate in the
worship in the Kāli temple. But Sri Ramakrishna loved his freedom and was indifferent to
any worldly career. The profession of the priesthood in a temple founded by a rich
woman did not appeal to his mind. Further, he hesitated to take upon himself the
responsibility for the ornaments and jewellery of the temple. Mathur had to wait for a
suitable occasion.
At this time there came to Dakshineśwar a youth of sixteen, destined to play an
important role in Sri Ramakrishna's life. Hriday, a distant nephew of Sri Ramakrishna,
hailed from Sihore, a village not far from Kāmārpukur, and had been his boyhood friend.
Clever, exceptionally energetic, and endowed with great presence of mind, he moved, as
will be seen later, like a shadow about his uncle and was always ready to help him, even
at the sacrifice of his personal comfort. He was destined to be a mute witness of many of
the spiritual experiences of Sri Ramakrishna and the caretaker of his body during the
stormy days of his spiritual practice. Hriday came to Dakshineśwar in search of a job,
and Sri Ramakrishna was glad to see him.
Unable to resist the persuasion of Mathur Bābu, Sri Ramakrishna at last entered the
temple service, on condition that Hriday should be asked to assist him. His first duty was
to dress and decorate the image of Kāli.
One day the priest of the Radhākānta temple accidentally dropped the image of Krishna
on the floor, breaking one of its legs. The pundits advised the Rāni to install a new
image, since the worship of an image with a broken limb was against the scriptural
injunctions. But the Rāni was fond of the image, and she asked Sri Ramakrishna's
opinion. In an abstracted mood, he said: "This solution is ridiculous. If a son-in-law of
the Rāni broke his leg, would she discard him and put another in his place? Wouldn't she
rather arrange for his treatment? Why should she not do the same thing in this case too?
Let the image be repaired and worshipped as before." It was a simple, straightforward
solution and was accepted by the Rāni. Sri Ramakrishna himself mended the break. The
priest was dismissed for his carelessness, and at Mathur Bābu's earnest request, Sri
Ramakrishna accepted the Office of priest in the Radhākānta temple.
Sri Ramakrishna as a priest
Born in an orthodox brāhmin family, Sri Ramakrishna knew the formalities of worship, its
rites and rituals. The innumerable gods and goddesses of the Hindu religion are the
human aspects of the indescribable and incomprehensible Spirit, as conceived by the
finite human mind. They understand and appreciate human love and emotion, help men
to realize their secular and spiritual ideals, and ultimately enable men to attain liberation
from the miseries of phenomenal life. The Source of light, intelligence, wisdom, and
strength is the One alone from whom comes the fulfilment of desire. Yet, as long as a
24man is bound by his human limitations, he cannot but worship God through human
forms. He must use human symbols. Therefore Hinduism asks the devotees to look on
God as the ideal father, the ideal mother, the ideal husband, the ideal son, or the ideal
friend. But the name ultimately leads to the Nameless, the form to the Formless, the
word to the Silence, the emotion to the serene realization of Peace in Existence-
Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. The gods gradually merge in the one God. But until that
realization is achieved, the devotee cannot dissociate human factors from his worship.
Therefore the Deity is bathed and clothed and decked with ornaments. He is fed and put
to sleep. He is propitiated with hymns, songs, and prayers. And there are appropriate
rites connected with all these functions. For instance, to secure for himself external
purity, the priest bathes himself in holy water and puts on a holy cloth. He purifies the
mind and the sense organs by appropriate meditations. He fortifies the place of worship
against evil forces by drawing around it circles of fire and water. He awakens the
different spiritual centres of the body and invokes the Supreme Spirit in his heart. Then
he transfers the Supreme Spirit to the image before him and worships the image,
regarding it no longer as clay or stone, but as the embodiment of Spirit, throbbing with
Life and Consciousness. After the worship the Supreme Spirit is recalled from the image
to Its true sanctuary, the heart of the priest. The real devotee knows the absurdity of
worshipping the Transcendental Reality with material articles - clothing That which
pervades the whole universe and the beyond, putting on a pedestal That which cannot
be limited by space, feeding That which is disembodied and incorporeal, singing before
That whose glory the music of the spheres tries vainly to proclaim. But through these
rites the devotee aspires to go ultimately beyond rites and rituals, forms and names,
words and praise, and to realize God as the All-pervading Consciousness.
Hindu priests are thoroughly acquainted with the rites of worship, but few of them are
aware of their underlying significance. They move their hands and limbs mechanically, in
obedience to the letter of the scriptures, and repeat the holy mantras like parrots. But
from the very beginning the inner meaning of these rites was revealed to Sri
Ramakrishna. As he sat facing the image, a strange transformation came over his mind.
While going through the prescribed ceremonies, he would actually find himself encircled
by a wall of fire protecting him and the place of worship from unspiritual vibrations, or
he would feel the rising of the mystic Kundalini through the different centres of the body.
The glow on his face, his deep absorption, and the intense atmosphere of the temple
impressed everyone who saw him worship the Deity.
Rāmkumār wanted Sri Ramakrishna to learn the intricate rituals of the worship of Kāli.
To become a priest of Kāli one must undergo a special form of initiation from a qualified
guru, and for Sri Ramakrishna a suitable brāhmin was found. But no sooner did the
brāhmin speak the holy word in his ear than Sri Ramakrishna, overwhelmed with
emotion, uttered a loud cry and plunged into deep concentration.
Mathur begged Sri Ramakrishna to take charge of the worship in the Kāli temple. The
young priest pleaded his incompetence and his ignorance of the scriptures. Mathur
insisted that devotion and sincerity would more than compensate for any lack of formal
25knowledge and make the Divine Mother manifest Herself through the image. In the end,
Sri Ramakrishna had to yield to Mathur's request. He became the priest of Kāli.
In 1856 Rāmkumār breathed his last. Sri Ramakrishna had already witnessed more than
one death in the family. He had come to realize how impermanent is life on earth. The
more he was convinced of the transitory nature of worldly things, the more eager he
became to realize God, the Fountain of Immortality.
The First Vision of Kāli
And, indeed, he soon discovered what a strange Goddess he had chosen to serve. He
became gradually enmeshed in the web of Her all-pervading presence. To the ignorant
She is to be sure, the image of destruction: but he found in Her the benign, all-loving
Mother. Her neck is encircled with a garland of heads, and Her waist with a girdle of
human arms and two of Her hands hold weapons of death, and Her eyes dart a glance of
fire; but, strangely enough, Ramakrishna felt in Her breath the soothing touch of tender
love and saw in Her the Seed of Immortality. She stands on the bosom of Her Consort,
Śiva; it is because She is the Śakti, the Power, inseparable from the Absolute. She is
surrounded by jackals and other unholy creatures, the denizens of the cremation ground.
But is not the Ultimate Reality above holiness and unholiness? She appears to be reeling
under the spell of wine. But who would create this mad world unless under the influence
of a divine drunkenness? She is the highest symbol of all the forces of nature, the
synthesis of their antinomies, the Ultimate Divine in the form of woman. She now
became to Sri Ramakrishna the only Reality, and the world became an unsubstantial
shadow. Into Her worship he poured his soul. Before him She stood as the transparent
portal to the shrine of Ineffable Reality.
The worship in the temple intensified Sri Ramakrishna's yearning for a living vision of the
Mother of the Universe. He began to spend in meditation the time not actually employed
in the temple service; and for this purpose he selected an extremely solitary place. A
deep jungle, thick with underbrush and prickly plants, lay to the north of the temples.
Used at one time as a burial ground, it was shunned by people even during the day-time
for fear of ghosts. There Sri Ramakrishna began to spend the whole night in meditation,
returning to his room only in the morning with eyes swollen as though from much
weeping. While meditating, he would lay aside his cloth and his brāhminical thread.
Explaining this strange conduct, he once said to Hriday: "Don't you know that when one
thinks of God one should be freed from all ties? From our very birth we have the eight
fetters of hatred, shame, lineage, pride of good conduct, fear, secretiveness, caste, and
grief. The sacred thread reminds me that I am a brāhmin and therefore superior to all.
When calling on the Mother one has to set aside all such ideas." Hriday thought his uncle
was becoming insane.
As his love for God deepened, he began either to forget or to drop the formalities of
worship. Sitting before the image, he would spend hours singing the devotional songs of
great devotees of the Mother, such as Kamalākānta and Rāmprasād. Those rhapsodical
songs, describing the direct vision of God, only intensified Sri Ramakrishna's longing. He
felt the pangs of a child separated from its mother. Sometimes, in agony, he would rub
26his face against the ground and weep so bitterly that people, thinking he had lost his
earthly mother, would sympathize with him in his grief. Sometimes, in moments of
scepticism, he would cry: "Art Thou true, Mother, or is it all fiction - mere poetry without
any reality? If Thou dost exist, why do I not see Thee? Is religion a mere fantasy and art
Thou only a figment of man's imagination?" Sometimes he would sit on the prayer carpet
for two hours like an inert object. He began to behave in an abnormal manner, most of
the time unconscious of the world. He almost gave up food; and sleep left him
altogether.
But he did not have to wait very long. He has thus described his first vision of the
Mother: "I felt as if my heart were being squeezed like a wet towel. I was overpowered
with a great restlessness and a fear that it might not be my lot to realize Her in this life.
I could not bear the separation from Her any longer. Life seemed to be not worth living.
Suddenly my glance fell on the sword that was kept in the Mother's temple. I determined
to put an end to my life. When I jumped up like a madman and seized it, suddenly the
blessed Mother revealed Herself. The buildings with their different parts, the temple, and
everything else vanished from my sight, leaving no trace whatsoever, and in their stead
I saw a limitless, infinite, effulgent Ocean of Consciousness. As far as the eye could see,
the shining billows were madly rushing at me from all sides with a terrific noise, to
swallow me up! I was panting for breath. I was caught in the rush and collapsed,
unconscious. What was happening in the outside world I did not know; but within me
there was a steady flow of undiluted bliss, altogether new, and I felt the presence of the
Divine Mother." On his lips when he regained consciousness of the world was the word
"Mother".
God-Intoxicated State
Yet this was only a foretaste of the intense experiences to come. The first glimpse of the
Divine Mother made him the more eager for Her uninterrupted vision. He wanted to see
Her both in meditation and with eyes open. But the Mother began to play a teasing game
of hide-and-seek with him, intensifying both his joy and his suffering. Weeping bitterly
during the moments of separation from Her, he would pass into a trance and then find
Her standing before him, smiling, talking, consoling, bidding him be of good cheer, and
instructing him. During this period of spiritual practice he had many uncommon
experiences. When he sat to meditate, he would hear strange clicking sounds in the
joints of his legs, as if someone were locking them up, one after the other, to keep him
motionless; and at the conclusion of his meditation he would again hear the same
sounds, this time unlocking them and leaving him free to move about. He would see
flashes like a swarm of fire-flies floating before his eyes, or a sea of deep mist around
him, with luminous waves of molten silver. Again, from a sea of translucent mist he
would behold the Mother rising, first Her feet, then Her waist, body, face, and head,
finally Her whole person; he would feel Her breath and hear Her voice. Worshipping in
the temple, sometimes he would become exalted, sometimes he would remain
motionless as stone, sometimes he would almost collapse from excessive emotion. Many
of his actions, contrary to all tradition, seemed sacrilegious to the people. He would take
a flower and touch it to his own head, body, and feet, and then offer it to the Goddess.
Or, like a drunkard, he would reel to the throne of the Mother, touch Her chin by way of
27showing his affection for Her, and sing, talk, joke, laugh, and dance. Or he would take a
morsel of food from the plate and hold it to Her mouth, begging Her to eat it, and would
not be satisfied till he was convinced that She had really eaten. After the Mother had
been put to sleep at night, from his own room he would hear Her ascending to the upper
storey of the temple with the light steps of a happy girl, Her anklets jingling. Then he
would discover Her standing with flowing hair, Her black form silhouetted against the sky
of the night looking at the Ganges or at the distant lights of Calcutta.
Naturally the temple officials took him for an insane person. His worldly well-wishers
brought him to skilled physicians; but no medicine could cure his malady. Many a time
he doubted his sanity himself. For he had been sailing across an uncharted sea, with no
earthly guide to direct him. His only haven of security was the Divine Mother Herself. To
Her he would pray: "I do not know what these things are. I am ignorant of mantras and
the scriptures. Teach me, Mother, how to realize Thee. Who else can help me? Art Thou
not my only refuge and guide?" And the sustaining presence of the Mother never failed
him in his distress or doubt. Even those who criticized his conduct were greatly
impressed with his purity, guilelessness, truthfulness, integrity, and holiness. They felt
an uplifting influence in his presence.
It is said that Samādhi, or trance, no more than opens the portal of the spiritual realm.
Sri Ramakrishna felt an unquenchable desire to enjoy God in various ways. For his
meditation he built a place in the northern wooded section of the temple garden. With
Hriday's help he planted there five sacred trees. The spot, known as the Panchavati,
became the scene of many of his visions.
As his spiritual mood deepened he more and more felt himself to be a child of the Divine
Mother. He learnt to surrender himself completely to Her will and let Her direct him.
"O Mother," he would constantly pray, "I have taken refuge in Thee. Teach me what to
do and what to say. Thy will is paramount everywhere and is for the good of Thy
children. Merge my will in Thy will and make me Thy instrument."
His visions became deeper and more intimate. He no longer had to meditate to behold
the Divine Mother. Even while retaining consciousness of the outer world, he would see
Her as tangibly as the temples, the trees, the river, and the men around him.
On a certain occasion Mathur Bābu stealthily entered the temple to watch the worship.
He was profoundly moved by the young priest's devotion and sincerity. He realized that
Sri Ramakrishna had transformed the stone image into the living Goddess.
Sri Ramakrishna one day fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to Kāli. This was
too much for the manager of the temple garden, who considered himself responsible for
the proper conduct of the worship. He reported Sri Ramakrishna's insane behaviour to
Mathur Bābu.
Sri Ramakrishna has described the incident: "The Divine Mother revealed to me in the
Kāli temple that it was She who had become everything. She showed me that everything
28was full of Consciousness. The image was Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness,
the water-vessels were Consciousness, the door-sill was Consciousness, the marble floor
was Consciousness - all was Consciousness. I found everything inside the room soaked,
as it were, in Bliss - the Bliss of God. I saw a wicked man in front of the Kāli temple; but
in him also I saw the power of the Divine Mother vibrating. That was why I fed a cat with
the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived that all this was
the Divine Mother - even the cat. The manager of the temple garden wrote to Mathur
Bābu saying that I was feeding the cat with the offering intended for the Divine Mother.
But Mathur Bābu had insight into the state of my mind. He wrote back to the manager:
'Let him do whatever he likes. You must not say anything to him.' "
One of the painful ailments from which Sri Ramakrishna suffered at this time was a
burning sensation in his body, and he was cured by a strange vision. During worship in
the temple, following the scriptural injunctions, he would imagine the presence of the
"sinner" in himself and the destruction of this "sinner". One day he was meditating in the
Panchavati, when he saw come out of him a red-eyed man of black complexion, reeling
like a drunkard. Soon there emerged from him another person, of serene countenance,
wearing the ochre cloth of a sannyāsi and carrying in his hand a trident. The second
person attacked the first and killed him with the trident. Thereafter Sri Ramakrishna was
free of his pain.
About this time he began to worship God by assuming the attitude of a servant toward
his master. He imitated the mood of Hanuman, the monkey chieftain of the Ramayana,
the ideal servant of Rāmā and traditional model for this self-effacing form of devotion.
When he meditated on Hanuman his movements and his way of life began to resemble
those of a monkey. His eyes became restless. He lived on fruits and roots. With his cloth
tied around his waist, a portion of it hanging in the form of a tail, he jumped from place
to place instead of walking. And after a short while he was blessed with a vision of Sitā,
the divine consort of Rāmā, who entered his body and disappeared there with the words,
"I bequeath to you my smile."
Mathur had faith in the sincerity of Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual zeal, but began now to
doubt his sanity. He had watched him jumping about like a monkey. One day, when Rāni
Rāsmani was listening to Sri Ramakrishna's singing in the temple, the young priest
abruptly turned and slapped her. Apparently listening to his song, she had actually been
thinking of a lawsuit. She accepted the punishment as though the Divine Mother Herself
had imposed it; but Mathur was distressed. He begged Sri Ramakrishna to keep his
feelings under control and to heed the conventions of society. God Himself, he argued,
follows laws. God never permitted, for instance, flowers of two colours to grow on the
same stalk. The following day Sri Ramakrishna presented Mathur Bābu with two hibiscus
flowers growing on the same stalk, one red and one white.
Mathur and Rāni
part, at least, to
relax the tension
as soon as the
Rāsmani began to ascribe the mental ailment of Sri Ramakrishna in
his observance of rigid continence. Thinking that a natural life would
of his nerves, they engineered a plan with two women of ill fame. But
women entered his room, Sri Ramakrishna beheld in them the
29manifestation of the Divine Mother of the Universe and went into Samādhi uttering Her
name.
Haladhāri
In 1858 there came to Dakshineśwar a cousin of Sri Ramakrishna, Haladhāri by name,
who was to remain there about eight years. On account of Sri Ramakrishna's indifferent
health, Mathur appointed this man to the office of priest in the Kāli temple. He was a
complex character, versed in the letter of the scriptures, but hardly aware of their spirit.
He loved to participate in hair-splitting theological discussions and, by the measure of his
own erudition, he proceeded to gauge Sri Ramakrishna. An orthodox brāhmin, he
thoroughly disapproved of his cousin's unorthodox actions, but he was not unimpressed
by Sri Ramakrishna's purity of life, ecstatic love of God, and yearning for realization.
One
day
Haladhāri
upset
Sri
Ramakrishna
with
the
statement
that
God
is
incomprehensible to the human mind. Sri Ramakrishna has described the great moment
of doubt when he wondered whether his visions had really misled him: "With sobs I
prayed to the Mother, 'Canst Thou have the heart to deceive me like this because I am a
fool?' A stream of tears flowed from my eyes. Shortly afterwards I saw a volume of mist
rising from the floor and filling the space before me. In the midst of it there appeared a
face with flowing beard, calm, highly expressive, and fair. Fixing its gaze steadily upon
me, it said solemnly, 'Remain in Bhāva-mukha, on the threshold of relative
consciousness.' This it repeated three times and then it gently disappeared in the mist,
which itself dissolved. This vision reassured me."
A garbled report of Sri Ramakrishna's failing health, indifference to worldly life, and
various abnormal activities reached Kāmārpukur and filled the heart of his poor mother
with anguish. At her repeated request he returned to his village for a change of air. But
his boyhood friends did not interest him any more. A divine fever was consuming him.
He spent a great part of the day and night in one of the cremation grounds, in
meditation. The place reminded him of the impermanence of the human body, of human
hopes and achievements. It also reminded him of Kāli, the Goddess of destruction.
Marriage and After
But in a few months his health showed improvement, and he recovered to some extent
his natural buoyancy of spirit. His happy mother was encouraged to think it might be a
good time to arrange his marriage. The boy was now twenty-three years old. A wife
would bring him back to earth. And she was delighted when her son welcomed her
suggestion. Perhaps he saw in it the finger of God.
Saradāmani, a little girl of five, lived in the neighbouring village called Jayrāmbāti. Even
at this age she had been praying to God to make her character as stainless and fragrant
as the white tuberose. Looking at the full moon, she would say: "O God, there are dark
spots even on the moon. But make my character spotless." It was she who was selected
as the bride for Sri Ramakrishna.
30The marriage ceremony was duly performed. Such early marriage in India is in the
nature of a betrothal, the marriage being consummated when the girl attains puberty.
But in this case the marriage remained for ever unconsummated. Sri Ramakrishna lived
at Kāmārpukur about a year and a half and then returned to Dakshineśwar.
Hardly had he crossed the threshold of the Kāli temple when he found himself again in
the whirlwind. His madness reappeared tenfold. The same meditation and prayer, the
same ecstatic moods, the same burning sensation, the same weeping, the same
sleeplessness, the same indifference to the body and the outside world, the same divine
delirium. He subjected himself to fresh disciplines in order to eradicate greed and lust,
the two great impediments to spiritual progress. With a rupee in one hand and some
earth in the other, he would reflect on the comparative value of these two for the
realization of God, and finding them equally worthless he would toss them, with equal
indifference, into the Ganges. Women he regarded as the manifestations of the Divine
Mother. Never even in a dream did he feel the impulses of lust. And to root out of his
mind the idea of caste superiority, he cleaned a pariah's house with his long and
neglected hair. When he would sit in meditation, birds would perch on his head and peck
in his hair for grains of food. Snakes would crawl over his body, and neither would he
aware of the other. Sleep left him altogether. Day and night, visions flitted before him.
He saw the sannyāsi who had previously killed the "sinner" in him again coming out of
his body, threatening him with the trident, and ordering him to concentrate on God. Or
the same sannyāsi would visit distant places, following a luminous path, and bring him
reports of what was happening there. Sri Ramakrishna used to say later that in the case
of an advanced devotee the mind itself becomes the guru, living and moving like an
embodied being.
Rāni Rāsmani, the foundress of the temple garden, passed away in 1861. After her death
her son-in-law Mathur became the sole executor of the estate. He placed himself and his
resources at the disposal of Sri Ramakrishna and began to look after his physical
comfort. Sri Ramakrishna later spoke of him as one of his five "suppliers of stores"
appointed by the Divine Mother. Whenever a desire arose in his mind, Mathur fulfilled it
without hesitation.
The Brāhmani
There came to Dakshineśwar at this time a brāhmin woman who was to play an
important part in Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual unfoldment. Born in East Bengāl, she was
an adept in the Tāntrik and Vaishnava methods of worship. She was slightly over fifty
years of age, handsome, and garbed in the orange robe of a nun. Her sole possessions
were a few books and two pieces of wearing-cloth.
Sri Ramakrishna welcomed the visitor with great respect, described to her his
experiences and visions, and told her of people's belief that these were symptoms of
madness. She listened to him attentively and said: "My son, everyone in this world is
mad. Some are mad for money, some for creature comforts, some for name and fame;
and you are mad for God." She assured him that he was passing through the almost
unknown spiritual experience described in the scriptures as Mahā–bhāva, the most
31exalted rapture of divine love. She told him that this extreme exaltation had been
described as manifesting itself through nineteen physical symptoms, including the
shedding of tears, a tremor of the body, horripilation, perspiration, and a burning
sensation. The Bhakti scriptures, she declared, had recorded only two instances of the
experience, namely, those of Sri Rādhā and Sri Chaitanya.
Very soon a tender relationship sprang up between Sri Ramakrishna and the Brāhmani,
she looking upon him as the Baby Krishna, and he upon her as mother. Day after day,
she watched his ecstasy during the kirtan and meditation, his Samādhi, his mad
yearning; and she recognized in him a power to transmit spirituality to others. She came
to the conclusion that such things were not possible for an ordinary devotee, not even
for a highly developed soul. Only an Incarnation of God was capable of such spiritual
manifestations. She proclaimed openly that Sri Ramakrishna, like Sri Chaitanya, was an
Incarnation of God.
When Sri Ramakrishna told Mathur what the Brāhmani had said about him, Mathur
shook his head in doubt. He was reluctant to accept him as an Incarnation of God, an
Avatar comparable to Rāmā, Krishna, Buddha, and Chaitanya, though he admitted Sri
Ramakrishna's extraordinary spirituality. Whereupon the Brāhmani asked Mathur to
arrange a conference of scholars who should discuss the matter with her. He agreed to
the proposal and the meeting was arranged. It was to be held in the Natmandir in front
of the Kāli temple.
Two famous pundits of the time were invited: Vaishnavcharan, the leader of the
Vaishnava society, and Gauri. The first to arrive was Vaishnavcharan, with a
distinguished company of scholars and devotees. The Brāhmani, like a proud mother,
proclaimed her view before him and supported it with quotations from the scriptures. As
the pundits discussed the deep theological question, Sri Ramakrishna, perfectly
indifferent to everything happening around him, sat in their midst like a child, immersed
in his own thoughts, sometimes smiling, sometimes chewing a pinch of spices from a
pouch, or again saying to Vaishnavcharan with a nudge: "Look here. Sometimes I feel
like this, too." Presently Vaishnavcharan arose to declare himself in total agreement with
the view of the Brāhmani. He declared that Sri Ramakrishna had undoubtedly
experienced Mahā-bhāva and that this was the certain sign of the rare manifestation of
God in a man. The people assembled there, especially the officers of the temple garden,
were struck dumb. Sri Ramakrishna said to Mathur, like a boy: "Just fancy, he too says
so! Well, I am glad to learn that, after all, it is not a disease."
When, a few days later, Pundit Gauri arrived, another meeting was held, and he agreed
with the view of the Brāhmani and Vaishnavcharan. To Sri Ramakrishna's remark that
Vaishnavcharan had declared him to be an Avatār, Gauri replied: "Is that all he has to
say about you? Then he has said very little. I am fully convinced that you are that Mine
of Spiritual Power, only a small fraction of which descends on earth, from time to time,
in the form of an Incarnation."
32"Ah!" said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile, "You seem to have quite outbid Vaishnavcharan
in this matter. What have you found in me that makes you entertain such an idea?"
Gauri said: "I feel it in my heart and I have the scriptures on my side. I am ready to
prove it to anyone who challenges me."
"Well," Sri Ramakrishna said, "it is you who say so; but, believe me, I know nothing
about it."
Thus, the insane priest was, by verdict of the great scholars of the day, proclaimed a
Divine Incarnation. His visions were not the result of an over heated brain; they had
precedent in spiritual history. And how did the proclamation affect Sri Ramakrishna
himself? He remained the simple child of the Mother that he had been since the first day
of his life. Years later, when two of his householder disciples openly spoke of him as a
Divine Incarnation and the matter was reported to him, he said with a touch of sarcasm:
"Do they think they will enhance my glory that way? One of them is an actor on the
stage and the other a physician. What do they know about Incarnations? Why years ago
pundits like Gauri and Vaishnavcharan declared me to be an Avatar. They were great
scholars and knew what they said. But that did not make any change in my mind."
Sri Ramakrishna was a learner all his life. He often used to quote a proverb to his
disciples: "Friend, the more I live the more I learn." When the excitement created by the
Brāhmani's declaration was over, he set himself to the task of practising spiritual
disciplines according to the traditional methods laid down in the Tantra and Vaishnava
scriptures. Hitherto he had pursued his spiritual ideal according to the promptings of his
own mind and heart. Now he accepted the Brāhmani as his guru and set foot on the
traditional highways.
Tantra
According to the Tantra, the Ultimate Reality is Chit, or Consciousness, which is identical
with Sat, or Being, and with Ānanda, or Bliss. This Ultimate Reality, Satchidānanda,
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, is identical with the Reality preached in the Vedas.
And man is identical with this Reality; but under the influence of Māyā, or illusion, he
has forgotten his true nature. He takes to be real a merely apparent world of subject and
object, and this error is the cause of his bondage and suffering. The goal of spiritual
discipline is the rediscovery of his true identity with the divine Reality.
For the achievement of this goal the Vedānta prescribes an austere negative method of
discrimination and renunciation, which can be followed by only a few individuals
endowed with sharp intelligence and unshakeable will-power. But Tantra takes into
consideration the natural weakness of human beings, their lower appetites, and their
love for the concrete. It combines philosophy with rituals, meditation with ceremonies,
renunciation with enjoyment. The underlying purpose is gradually to train the aspirant to
meditate on his identity with the Ultimate.
The average man wishes to enjoy the material objects of the world. Tantra bids him
enjoy these, but at the same time, discover in them the presence of God. Mystical rites
33are prescribed by which, slowly, the sense objects become spiritualized and sense
attraction is transformed into a love of God. So the very "bonds" of man are turned into
"releasers". The very poison that kills is transmuted into the elixir of life. Outward
renunciation is not necessary. Thus, the aim of Tantra is to sublimate Bhoga, or
enjoyment, into Yoga, or union with Consciousness. For, according to this philosophy,
the world with all its manifestations is nothing but the sport of Śiva and Śakti, the
Absolute and Its inscrutable Power.
The disciplines of Tantra are graded to suit aspirants of all degrees. Exercises are
prescribed for people with "animal", "heroic", and "divine" outlooks. Certain of the rites
require the presence of members of the opposite sex. Here the aspirant learns to look on
woman as the embodiment of the Goddess Kāli, the Mother of the Universe. The very
basis of Tantra is the Motherhood of God and the glorification of woman. Every part of a
woman's body is to be regarded as incarnate Divinity. But the rites are extremely
dangerous. The help of a qualified guru is absolutely necessary. An unwary devotee may
lose his foothold and fall into a pit of depravity.
According to the Tantra, Śakti is the active creative force in the universe. Śiva, the
Absolute, is a more or less passive principle. Further, Śakti is as inseparable from Śiva
as fire's power to burn is from fire itself. Śakti, the Creative Power, contains in Its womb
the universe, and therefore is the Divine Mother. All women are Her symbols. Kāli is one
of Her several forms. The meditation on Kāli, the Creative Power, is the central discipline
of the Tantra. While meditating, the aspirant at first regards himself as one with the
Absolute and then thinks that out of that Impersonal Consciousness emerge two entities,
namely, his own self and the living form of the Goddess. He then projects the Goddess
into the tangible image before him and worships it as the Divine Mother.
Sri Ramakrishna set himself to the task of practising the disciplines of Tantra; and at the
bidding of the Divine Mother Herself he accepted the Brāhmani as his guru. He
performed profound and delicate ceremonies in the Panchavati and under the bel-tree at
the northern extremity of the temple compound. He practised all the disciplines of the
sixty-four principal Tantra books, and it took him never more than three days to achieve
the result promised in any one of them. After the observance of a few preliminary rites,
he would be overwhelmed with a strange divine fervour and would go into Samādhi,
where his mind would dwell in exaltation. Evil ceased to exist for him. The word "carnal"
lost its meaning. The whole world and everything in it appeared as the Lila, the sport, of
Śiva and Śakti. He beheld everywhere manifest the power and beauty of the Mother, the
whole world, animate and inanimate, appeared to him as pervaded with Chit,
Consciousness, and with Ānanda, Bliss.
He saw in a vision the Ultimate Cause of the universe as a huge luminous triangle giving
birth every moment to an infinite number of worlds. He heard the Anāhata Śabda, the
great sound Om, of which the innumerable sounds of the universe are only so many
echoes. He acquired the eight supernatural powers of Yoga, which make a man almost
omnipotent, and these he spurned as of no value whatsoever to the Spirit. He had a
vision of the divine Māyā, the inscrutable Power of God, by which the universe is created
34and sustained, and into which it is finally absorbed. In this vision he saw a woman of
exquisite beauty, about to become a mother, emerging from the Ganges and slowly
approaching the Panchavati. Presently she gave birth to a child and began to nurse it
tenderly. A moment later she assumed a terrible aspect, seized the child with her grim
jaws and crushed it. Swallowing it, she re-entered the waters of the Ganges.
But the most remarkable experience during this period was the awakening of the
Kundalini Śakti, the "Serpent Power". He actually saw the Power, at first lying asleep at
the bottom of the spinal column, then waking up and ascending along the mystic
Sushumna canal and through its six centres, or lotuses, to the Sahasrāra, the thousand-
petalled lotus in the top of the head. He further saw that as the Kundalini went upward
the different lotuses bloomed. And this phenomenon was accompanied by visions and
trances. Later on he described to his disciples and devotees the various movements of
the Kundalini: the fishlike, birdlike, monkey like, and so on. The awakening of the
Kundalini is the beginning of spiritual consciousness, and its union with Śiva in the
Sahasrāra, ending in Samādhi, is the consummation of the Tāntrik disciplines.
About this time it was revealed to him that in a short while many devotees would seek
his guidance.
Vaishnava Disciplines
After completing the Tāntrik sādhana Sri Ramakrishna followed the Brāhmani in the
disciplines of Vaishnavism. The Vaishnavas are worshippers of Vishnu, the "All-
pervading", the Supreme God, who is also known as Hari and Nārāyana. Of Vishnu's
various Incarnations the two with the largest number of followers are Rāmā and Krishna.
Vaishnavism is exclusively a religion of bhakti. Bhakti is intense love of God, attachment
to Him alone; it is of the nature of bliss and bestows upon the lover immortality and
liberation. God, according to Vaishnavism, cannot be realized through logic or reason;
and, without bhakti, all penances, austerities, and rites are futile. Man cannot realize
God by self-exertion alone. For the vision of God His grace is absolutely necessary, and
this grace is felt by the pure of heart. The mind is to be purified through bhakti. The pure
mind then remains for ever immersed in the ecstasy of God-vision. It is the cultivation of
this divine love that is the chief concern of the Vaishnava religion.
There are three kinds of formal devotion: tāmasic, rājasic, and sāttvic. If a person, while
showing devotion to God, is actuated by malevolence, arrogance, jealousy, or anger,
then his devotion is tāmasic, since it is influenced by tamas, the quality of inertia. If he
worships God from a desire for fame or wealth, or from any other worldly ambition, then
his devotion is rājasic, since it is influenced by rajas, the quality of activity. But if a
person loves God without any thought of material gain, if he performs his duties to
please God alone and maintains toward all created beings the attitude of friendship, then
his devotion is called sāttvic, since it is influenced by sattva, the quality of harmony. But
the highest devotion transcends the three gunās, or qualities, being a spontaneous,
uninterrupted inclination of the mind toward God, the Inner Soul of all beings; and it
wells up in the heart of a true devotee as soon as he hears the name of God or mention
35of God's attributes. A devotee possessed of this love would not accept the happiness of
heaven if it were offered him. His one desire is to love God under all conditions - in
pleasure and pain, life and death, honour and dishonour, prosperity and adversity.
There are two stages of bhakti. The first is known as Vaidhi–Bhakti, or love of God
qualified by scriptural injunctions. For the devotees of this stage are prescribed regular
and methodical worship, hymns, prayers, the repetition of God's name, and the chanting
of His glories. This lower bhakti in course of time matures into Parā–Bhakti, or supreme
devotion, known also as Prema, the most intense form of divine love. Divine love is an
end in itself. It exists potentially in all human hearts, but in the case of bound creatures
it is misdirected to earthly objects.
To develop the devotee's love for God, Vaishnavism humanises God. God is to be
regarded as the devotee's Parent, Master, Friend, Child, Husband, or Sweetheart, each
succeeding relationship representing an intensification of love. These Bhāvās, or attitudes
toward God, are known as Śānta, Dāsya, Sakhya, Vātsalya, and Madhur. The rishis of
the Vedās, Hanumān, the cowherd boys of Vrindāvan, Rāmā's mother Kausalya, and
Rādhika, Krishna's sweetheart, exhibited, respectively, the most perfect examples of
these forms. In the ascending scale the glories of God are gradually forgotten and the
devotee realizes more and more the intimacy of divine communion. Finally he regards
himself as the mistress of his Beloved, and no artificial barrier remains to separate him
from his Ideal. No social or moral obligation can bind to the earth his soaring spirit. He
experiences perfect union with the Godhead. Unlike the Vedantist, who strives to
transcend all varieties of the subject-object relationship, a devotee of the Vaishnava
path wishes to retain both his own individuality and the personality of God. To him God
is not an intangible Absolute, but the Purushottama, the Supreme Person.
While practising the discipline of the Madhur Bhāva, the male devotee often regards
himself as a woman, in order to develop the most intense form of love for Sri Krishna,
the only Purusha, or man, in the universe. This assumption of the attitude of the
opposite sex has a deep psychological significance. It is a matter of common experience
that an idea may be cultivated to such an intense degree that every idea alien to it is
driven from the mind. This peculiarity of the mind may he utilised for the subjugation of
the lower desires and the development of the spiritual nature. Now, the idea which is the
basis of all desires and passions in a man is the conviction of his indissoluble association
with a male body. If he can inoculate himself thoroughly with the idea that he is a
woman, he can get rid of the desires peculiar to his male body. Again, the idea that he is
a woman may in turn be made to give way to another higher idea, namely, that he is
neither man nor woman, but the Impersonal Spirit. The Impersonal Spirit alone can
enjoy real communion with the Impersonal God. Hence the highest realization of the
Vaishnava draws close to the transcendental experience of the Vedantist.
A beautiful expression of the Vaishnava worship of God through love is to be found in the
Vrindāvan episode of the Bhāgavata. The gopis, or milk-maids, of Vrindāvan regarded
the six-year-old Krishna as their Beloved. They sought no personal gain or happiness
from this love. They surrendered to Krishna their bodies, minds, and souls. Of all the
36gopis, Rādhika, or Rādhā, because of her intense love for Him, was the closest to
Krishna. She manifested Mahā–bhāva and was united with her Beloved. This union
represents, through sensuous language, a supersensuous experience.
Sri Chaitanya, also known as Gaurānga, Gorā, or Nimāi, born in Bengāl in 1485 and
regarded as an Incarnation of God, is a great prophet of the Vaishnava religion.
Chaitanya declared the chanting of God's name to be the most efficacious spiritual
discipline for the Kali–Yuga.
Sri Ramakrishna, as the monkey Hanumān, had already worshipped God as his Master.
Through his devotion to Kāli he had worshipped God as his Mother. He was now to take
up the other relationships prescribed by the Vaishnava scriptures.
Ramlālā
About the year 1864 there came to Dakshineśwar a wandering Vaishnava monk,
Jatādhāri, whose Ideal Deity was Rāmā. He always carried with him a small metal image
of the Deity, which he called by the endearing name of Ramlālā, the Boy Rāmā. Toward
this little image he displayed the tender affection of Kausalya for her divine Son, Rāmā.
As a result of lifelong spiritual practice he had actually found in the metal image the
presence of his Ideal. Ramlālā was no longer for him a metal image, but the living God.
He devoted himself to nursing Rāmā, feeding Rāmā, playing with Rāmā, taking Rāmā for
a walk, and bathing Rāmā. And he found that the image responded to his love.
Sri Ramakrishna, much impressed with his devotion, requested Jatādhāri to spend a few
days at Dakshineśwar. Soon Ramlālā became the favourite companion of Sri
Ramakrishna too. Later on he described to the devotees how the little image would
dance gracefully before him, jump on his back, insist on being taken in his arms, run to
the fields in the sun, pluck flowers from the bushes, and play pranks like a naughty boy.
A very sweet relationship sprang up between him and Ramlālā, for whom he felt the love
of a mother.
One day Jatādhāri requested Sri Ramakrishna to keep the image and bade him adieu
with tearful eyes. He declared that Ramlālā had fulfilled his innermost prayer and that he
now had no more need of formal worship. A few days later Sri Ramakrishna was blessed
through Ramlālā with a vision of Rāmachandra, whereby he realized that the Rāmā of
the Ramayana, the son of Daśaratha, pervades the whole universe as Spirit and
Consciousness; that He is its Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer; that, in still another
aspect, He is the transcendental Brahman, without form, attribute, or name.
While worshipping Ramlālā as the Divine Child, Sri Ramakrishna's heart became filled
with motherly tenderness, and he began to regard himself as a woman. His speech and
gestures changed. He began to move freely with the ladies of Mathur's family, who now
looked upon him as one of their own sex. During this time he worshipped the Divine
Mother as Her companion or handmaid.
In Communion with the Divine Beloved
37Sri Ramakrishna now devoted himself to scaling the most inaccessible and dizzy heights
of dualistic worship, namely, the complete union with Sri Krishna as the Beloved of the
heart. He regarded himself as one of the gopis of Vrindāvan, mad with longing for her
divine Sweetheart. At his request Mathur provided him with woman's dress and
jewellery. In this love pursuit, food and drink were forgotten. Day and night he wept
bitterly. The yearning turned into a mad frenzy; for the divine Krishna began to play with
him the old tricks He had played with the gopis. He would tease and taunt, now and then
revealing Himself, but always keeping at a distance. Sri Ramakrishna's anguish brought
on a return of the old physical symptoms: the burning sensation, an oozing of blood
through the pores, a loosening of the joints, and the stopping of physiological functions.
The Vaishnava scriptures advise one to propitiate Rādhā and obtain her grace in order to
realize Sri Krishna. So the tortured devotee now turned his prayer to her. Within a short
time he enjoyed her blessed vision. He saw and felt the figure of Rādhā disappearing into
his own body.
He said later on: "It is impossible to describe the heavenly beauty and sweetness of
Rādhā. Her very appearance showed that she had completely forgotten herself in her
passionate attachment to Krishna. Her complexion was a light yellow."
Now one with Rādhā, he manifested the great ecstatic love, the Mahā–bhāva which had
found in her its fullest expression. Later Sri Ramakrishna said: "The manifestation in the
same individual of the nineteen different kinds of emotion for God is called, in the books
on bhakti, Mahā–bhāva. An ordinary man takes a whole lifetime to express even a single
one of these. But in this body [meaning himself] there has been a complete
manifestation of all nineteen."
The love of Rādhā is the precursor of the resplendent vision of Sri Krishna, and Sri
Ramakrishna soon experienced that vision. The enchanting form of Krishna appeared to
him and merged in his person. He became Krishna; he totally forgot his own individuality
and the world; he saw Krishna in himself and in the universe. Thus he attained to the
fulfilment of the worship of the Personal God. He drank from the fountain of Immortal
Bliss. The agony of his heart vanished forever. He realized Amrita, Immortality, beyond
the shadow of death.
One day, listening to a recitation of the Bhāgavata on the verandah of the Radhākānta
temple he fell into a divine mood and saw the enchanting form of Krishna. He perceived
the luminous rays issuing from Krishna's Lotus Feet in the form of a stout rope, which
touched first the Bhāgavata and then his own chest, connecting all three - God, the
scripture, and the devotee. "After this vision," he used to say, "I came to realize that
Bhagavān–Bhakta–and–Bhāgavata -- God–Devotee–and–Scripture -- are in reality, one
and the same."
Vedānta
The Brāhmani was the enthusiastic teacher and astonished beholder of Sri Ramakrishna
in his spiritual progress. She became proud of the achievements of her unique pupil. But
38the pupil himself was not permitted to rest; his destiny beckoned him forward. His Divine
Mother would allow him no respite till he had left behind the entire realm of duality with
its visions, experiences, and ecstatic dreams. But for the new ascent the old tender
guides would not suffice. The Brāhmani, on whom he had depended for three years saw
her son escape from her to follow the command of a teacher with masculine strength, a
sterner mien, a gnarled physique, and a virile voice. The new guru was a wandering
monk, the sturdy Totāpuri, whom Sri Ramakrishna learnt to address affectionately as
Nangta, the "Naked One", because of his total renunciation of all earthly objects and
attachments, including even a piece of wearing-cloth.
Totāpuri was the bearer of a philosophy new to Sri Ramakrishna, the non-dualistic
Vedānta philosophy, whose conclusions Totāpuri had experienced in his own life. This
ancient Hindu system designates the Ultimate Reality as Brahman, also described as
Satchidānanda, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Brahman is the only Real Existence.
In It there is no time, no space, no causality, no multiplicity. But through Māyā, Its
inscrutable Power, time, space, and causality are created and the One appears to break
into the many. The eternal Spirit appears as a manifold of individuals endowed with form
and subject to the conditions of time. The Immortal becomes a victim of birth and death.
The Changeless undergoes change. The sinless Pure Soul, hypnotised by Its own Māyā,
experiences the joys of heaven and the pains of hell. But these experiences based on the
duality of the subject-object relationship are unreal. Even the vision of a Personal God is,
ultimately speaking, as illusory as the experience of any other object. Man attains his
liberation, therefore, by piercing the veil of Māyā and rediscovering his total identity with
Brahman. Knowing himself to be one with the Universal Spirit, he realizes ineffable
Peace. Only then does he go beyond the fiction of birth and death; only then does he
become immortal. And this is the ultimate goal of all religions - to dehypnotize the soul
now hypnotized by its own ignorance.
The path of the Vedāntic discipline is the path of negation, "Neti", in which, by stern
determination, all that is unreal is both negated and renounced. It is the path of jnāna,
knowledge, the direct method of realizing the Absolute. After the negation of everything
relative, including the discriminating ego itself, the aspirant merges in the One without a
Second, in the bliss of nirvikalpa Samādhi, where subject and object are alike dissolved.
The soul goes beyond the realm of thought. The domain of duality is transcended. Māyā
is left behind with all its changes and modifications. The Real Man towers above the
delusions of creation, preservation, and destruction. An avalanche of indescribable Bliss
sweeps away all relative ideas of pain and pleasure, good and evil. There shines in the
heart the glory of the Eternal Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Knower,
knowledge, and known are dissolved in the Ocean of one eternal Consciousness; love,
lover, and beloved merge in the unbounded Sea of supreme Felicity; birth, growth, and
death vanish in infinite Existence. All doubts and misgivings are quelled for ever; the
oscillations of the mind are stopped; the momentum of past actions is exhausted.
Breaking down the ridge-pole of the tabernacle in which the soul has made its abode for
untold ages, stilling the body, calming the mind, drowning the ego, the sweet joy of
Brahman wells up in that superconscious state. Space disappears into nothingness, time
39is swallowed in eternity, and causation becomes a dream of the past. Only Existence is.
Ah! Who can describe what the soul then feels in its communion with the Self?
Even when man descends from this dizzy height, he is devoid of ideas of "I" and "mine";
he looks on the body as a mere shadow, an outer sheath encasing the soul. He does not
dwell on the past, takes no thought for the future, and looks with indifference on the
present. He surveys everything in the world with an eye of equality; he is no longer
touched by the infinite variety of phenomena; he no longer reacts to pleasure and pain.
He remains unmoved whether he - that is to say, his body - is worshipped by the good
or tormented by the wicked; for he realizes that it is the one Brahman that manifests
Itself through everything. The impact of such an experience devastates the body and
mind. Consciousness becomes blasted, as it were, with an excess of Light. In the
Vedānta books it is said that after the experience of nirvikalpa Samādhi the body drops
off like a dry leaf. Only those who are born with a special mission for the world can
return from this height to the valleys of normal life. They live and move in the world for
the welfare of mankind. They are invested with a supreme spiritual power. A divine glory
shines through them.
Totāpuri
Totāpuri arrived at the Dakshineśwar temple garden toward the end of 1864. Perhaps
born in the Punjab, he was the head of a monastery in that province of India and
claimed leadership of seven hundred sannyāsis. Trained from early youth in the
disciplines of the Advaita Vedānta, he looked upon the world as an illusion. The gods and
goddesses of the dualistic worship were to him mere fantasies of the deluded mind.
Prayers, ceremonies, rites, and rituals had nothing to do with true religion, and about
these he was utterly indifferent. Exercising self-exertion and unshakable will-power, he
had liberated himself from attachment to the sense-objects of the relative universe. For
forty years he had practised austere discipline on the bank of the sacred Narmada and
had finally realized his identity with the Absolute. Thenceforward he roamed in the world
as an unfettered soul, a lion free from the cage. Clad in a loin-cloth, he spent his days
under the canopy of the sky alike in storm and sunshine, feeding his body on the slender
pittance of alms. He had been visiting the estuary of the Ganges. On his return journey
along the bank of the sacred river, led by the inscrutable Divine Will, he stopped at
Dakshineśwar.
Totāpuri, discovering at once that Sri Ramakrishna was prepared to be a student of
Vedānta, asked to initiate him into its mysteries. With the permission of the Divine
Mother, Sri Ramakrishna agreed to the proposal. But Totāpuri explained that only a
sannyāsi could receive the teaching of Vedānta. Sri Ramakrishna agreed to renounce the
world, but with the stipulation that the ceremony of his initiation into the monastic order
be performed in secret, to spare the feelings of his old mother, who had been living with
him at Dakshineśwar.
On the appointed day, in the small hours of the morning, a fire was lighted in the
Panchavati. Totāpuri and Sri Ramakrishna sat before it. The flame played on their faces.
"Ramakrishna was a small brown man with a short beard and beautiful eyes, long dark
40eyes, full of light, obliquely set and slightly veiled, never very wide open, but seeing
half-closed a great distance both outwardly and inwardly. His mouth was open over his
white teeth in a bewitching smile, at once affectionate and mischievous. Of medium
height, he was thin to emaciation and extremely delicate. His temperament was high-
strung, for he was supersensitive to all the winds of joy and sorrow, both moral and
physical. He was indeed a living reflection of all that happened before the mirror of his
eyes, a two-sided mirror, turned both out and in." Facing him, the other rose like a
rock. He was very tall and robust, a sturdy and tough oak. His constitution and mind
were of iron. He was the strong leader of men.
In the burning flame before him Sri Ramakrishna performed the rituals of destroying his
attachment to relatives, friends, body, mind, sense-organs, ego, and the world. The
leaping flame swallowed it all, making the initiate free and pure. The sacred thread and
the tuft of hair were consigned to the fire, completing his severance from caste, sex, and
society. Last of all he burnt in that fire, with all that is holy as his witness, his desire for
enjoyment here and hereafter. He uttered the sacred mantras giving assurance of safety
and fearlessness to all beings, who were only manifestations of his own Self. The rites
completed, the disciple received from the guru the loincloth and ochre robe, the
emblems of his new life.
The teacher and the disciple repaired to the meditation room near by. Totāpuri began to
impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedānta. "Brahman", he said, "is the only
Reality, ever pure, ever illumined, ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and
causation. Though apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable
power of Māyā, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really
One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of Samādhi, he does not
perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring of Māyā. Whatever is within the
domain of Māyā is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and
rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realize It
through Samādhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the
puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will realize your identity with
Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute." Quoting the Upanishad, Totāpuri said
"That knowledge is shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is
shallow is worthless and can never give real felicity. But the Knowledge by which one
does not see another or hear another or know another, which is beyond duality, is great,
and through such Knowledge one attains the Infinite Bliss. How can the mind and senses
grasp That which shines in the heart of all as the Eternal Subject?"
Totāpuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of relative world,
including the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on the Absolute. But the task was
not easy even for Sri Ramakrishna. He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kāli,
the Divine Mother of the Universe. "After the initiation", Sri Ramakrishna once said,
describing the event, "Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita
Vedānta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all objects and dive deep
into the Ātman. But in spite of all my attempts I could not altogether cross the realm of
name and form and bring my mind to the unconditioned state. I had no difficulty in
41taking the mind from all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too familiar figure
of the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence of Pure Consciousness, appeared
before me as a living reality. Her bewitching smile prevented me from passing into the
Great Beyond. Again and again I tried, but She stood in my way every time. In despair I
said to Nangta: 'It is hopeless. I cannot raise my mind to the unconditioned state and
come face to face with Ātman.' He grew excited and sharply said: 'What? You can't do it?
But you have to.' He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and
stuck it between my eyebrows. 'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered. Then
with stern determination I again sat to meditate. As soon as the gracious form of the
Divine Mother appeared before me, I used my discrimination as a sword and with it clove
Her in two. The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I
lost myself in Samādhi."
Sri Ramakrishna remained completely absorbed in Samādhi for three days. "Is it really
true?" Totāpuri cried out in astonishment. "Is it possible that he has attained in a single
day what it took me forty years of strenuous practice to achieve? Great God! It is
nothing short of a miracle!" With the help of Totāpuri, Sri Ramakrishna's mind finally
came down to the relative Plane.
Totāpuri, a monk of the most orthodox type, never stayed at a place more than three
days. But he remained at Dakshineśwar eleven months. He too had something to learn.
Totāpuri had no idea of the struggles of ordinary men in the toils of passion and desire.
Having maintained all through life the guilelessness of a child, he laughed at the idea of
a man's being led astray by the senses. He was convinced that the world, was Māyā and
had only to be denounced to vanish for ever. A born non-dualist, he had no faith in a
Personal God. He did not believe in the terrible aspect of Kāli, much less in Her benign
aspect. Music and the chanting of God's holy name were to him only so much nonsense.
He ridiculed the spending of emotion on the worship of a Personal God.
Kāli and Māyā
Sri Ramakrishna, on the other hand, though fully aware, like his guru, that the world is
an illusory appearance, instead of slighting Māyā, like an orthodox monist, acknowledged
its power in the relative life. He was all love and reverence for Māyā, perceiving in it a
mysterious and majestic expression of Divinity. To him Māyā itself was God, for
everything was God. It was one of the faces of Brahman. What he had realized on the
heights of the transcendental plane, he also found here below, everywhere about him,
under the mysterious garb of names and forms. And this garb was a perfectly
transparent sheath, through which he recognized the glory of the Divine Immanence.
Māyā, the mighty weaver of the garb, is none other than Kāli, the Divine Mother. She is
the primordial Divine Energy, Śakti, and She can no more be distinguished from the
Supreme Brahman than can the power of burning be distinguished from fire. She
projects the world and again withdraws it. She spins it as the spider spins its web. She is
the Mother of the Universe, identical with the Brahman of Vedānta, and with the Ātman
of Yoga. As eternal Lawgiver, She makes and unmakes laws; it is by Her imperious will
that karma yields its fruit. She ensnares men with illusion and again releases them from
42bondage with a look of Her benign eyes. She is the supreme Mistress of the cosmic play,
and all objects, animate and inanimate, dance by Her will. Even those who realize the
Absolute in nirvikalpa Samādhi are under Her jurisdiction as long as they still live on the
relative plane.
Thus, after Nirvikalpa Samādhi, Sri Ramakrishna realized Māyā in an altogether new
role. The binding aspect of Kāli vanished from before his vision. She no longer obscured
his understanding. The world became the glorious manifestation of the Divine Mother.
Māyā became Brahman. The Transcendental Itself broke through the Immanent. Sri
Ramakrishna discovered that Māyā operates in the relative world in two ways, and he
termed these "Avidyā–Māyā" and "Vidyā–Māyā". Avidyā–Māyā represents the dark forces
of creation: sensuous desires, evil passions, greed, lust, cruelty, and so on. It sustains
the world system on the lower planes. It is responsible for the round of man's birth and
death. It must be fought and vanquished. But Vidyā–Māyā is the higher force of
creation: the spiritual virtues, the enlightening qualities, kindness, purity, love, devotion.
Vidyā–Māyā elevates man to the higher planes of consciousness. With the help of Vidyā–
Māyā the devotee rids himself of Avidyā–Māyā; he then becomes Māyātita , free of Māyā.
The two aspects of Māyā are the two forces of creation, the two powers of Kāli; and She
stands beyond them both. She is like the effulgent sun, bringing into existence and
shining through and standing behind the clouds of different colours and shapes,
conjuring up wonderful forms in the blue autumn heaven.
The Divine Mother asked Sri Ramakrishna not to be lost in the featureless Absolute but
to remain in Bhāva–mukha, on the threshold of relative consciousness, the border line
between the Absolute and the Relative. He was to keep himself at the "sixth centre" of
Tantra, from which he could see not only the glory of the seventh, but also the divine
manifestations of the Kundalini in the lower centres. He gently oscillated back and forth
across the dividing line. Ecstatic devotion to the Divine Mother alternated with serene
absorption in the Ocean of Absolute Unity. He thus bridged the gulf between the
Personal and the Impersonal, the immanent and the transcendent aspects of Reality.
This is a unique experience in the recorded spiritual history of the world.
Totāpuri's Lesson
From Sri Ramakrishna Totāpuri had to learn the significance of Kāli, the Great Fact of the
relative world, and of Māyā, Her indescribable Power.
One day, when guru and disciple were engaged in an animated discussion about
Vedānta, a servant of the temple garden came there and took a coal from the sacred fire
that had been lighted by the great ascetic. He wanted it to light his tobacco. Totāpuri
flew into a rage and was about to beat the man. Sri Ramakrishna rocked with laughter.
"What a shame!" he cried. "You are explaining to me the reality of Brahman and the
illusoriness of the world; yet now you have so far forgotten yourself as to be about to
beat a man in a fit of passion. The power of Māyā is indeed inscrutable!" Totāpuri was
embarrassed.
43About this time Totāpuri was suddenly laid up with a severe attack of dysentery. On
account of this miserable illness he found it impossible to meditate. One night the pain
became excruciating. He could no longer concentrate on Brahman. The body stood in the
way. He became incensed with its demands. A free soul, he did not at all care for the
body. So he determined to drown it in the Ganges. Thereupon he walked into the river.
But, lo! He walks to the other bank. Is there not enough water in the Ganges? Standing
dumbfounded on the other bank he looks back across the water. The trees, the temples,
the houses, are silhouetted against the sky. Suddenly, in one dazzling moment, he sees
on all sides the presence of the Divine Mother. She is in everything; She is everything.
She is in the water; She is on land. She is the body; She is the mind. She is pain; She is
comfort. She is knowledge; She is ignorance. She is life; She is death. She is everything
that one sees, hears, or imagines. She turns "yea" into "nay", and "nay" into "yea".
Without Her grace no embodied being can go beyond Her realm. Man has no free will. He
is not even free to die. Yet, again, beyond the body and mind She resides in Her
Transcendental Absolute aspect. She is the Brahman that Totāpuri had been worshipping
all his life.
Totāpuri returned to Dakshineśwar and spent the remaining hours of the night
meditating on the Divine Mother. In the morning he went to the Kāli temple with Sri
Ramakrishna and prostrated himself before the image of the Mother. He now realized
why he had spent eleven months at Dakshineśwar. Bidding farewell to the disciple, he
continued on his way, enlightened.
Sri Ramakrishna later described the significance of Totāpuri's lessons: "When I think of
the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying -, I call
Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active - creating,
preserving, and destroying -, I call Him Śakti or Māyā or Prakriti, the Personal God. But
the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and the
Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre,
the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the
other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one."
After the departure of Totāpuri, Sri Ramakrishna remained for six months in a state of
absolute identity with Brahman. "For six months at a stretch", he said, "I remained in
that state from which ordinary men can never return; generally the body falls off, after
three weeks, like a sere leaf. I was not conscious of day and night. Flies would enter my
mouth and nostrils just as they do a dead body's, but I did not feel them. My hair
became matted with dust."
His body would not have survived but for the kindly attention of a monk who happened
to be at Dakshineśwar at that time and who somehow realized that for the good of
humanity Sri Ramakrishna's body must be preserved. He tried various means, even
physical violence, to recall the fleeing soul to the prison-house of the body, and during
the resultant fleeting moments of consciousness he would push a few morsels of food
down Sri Ramakrishna's throat. Presently Sri Ramakrishna received the command of the
Divine Mother to remain on the threshold of relative consciousness. Soon thereafter he
44was afflicted with a serious attack of dysentery. Day and night the pain tortured him,
and his mind gradually came down to the physical plane.
Company of Holy Men and Devotees
From now on Sri Ramakrishna began to seek the company of devotees and holy men. He
had gone through the storm and stress of spiritual disciplines and visions. Now he
realized an inner calmness and appeared to others as a normal person. But he could not
bear the company of worldly people or listen to their talk. Fortunately the holy
atmosphere of Dakshineśwar and the liberality of Mathur attracted monks and holy men
from all parts of the country. Sādhus of all denominations - monists and dualists,
Vaishnavas and Vedāntists, Śāktās and worshippers of Rāmā - flocked there in ever
increasing numbers. Ascetics and visionaries came to seek Sri Ramakrishna's advice.
Vaishnavas had come during the period of his Vaishnava sādhana, and Tāntriks when he
practised the disciplines of Tantra. Vedāntists began to arrive after the departure of
Totāpuri. In the room of Sri Ramakrishna, who was then in bed with dysentery, the
Vedāntists engaged in scriptural discussions, and, forgetting his own physical suffering,
he solved their doubts by referring directly to his own experiences. Many of the visitors
were genuine spiritual souls, the unseen pillars of Hinduism, and their spiritual lives were
quickened in no small measure by the sage of Dakshineśwar. Sri Ramakrishna in turn
learnt from them anecdotes concerning the ways and the conduct of holy men, which he
subsequently narrated to his devotees and disciples. At his request Mathur provided him
with large stores of foodstuffs, clothes, and so forth, for distribution among the
wandering monks.
Sri Ramakrishna had not read books, yet he possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of
religions and religious philosophies. This he acquired from his contacts with innumerable
holy men and scholars. He had a unique power of assimilation; through meditation he
made this knowledge a part of his being. Once, when he was asked by a disciple about
the source of his seemingly inexhaustible knowledge, he replied: "I have not read; but I
have heard the learned. I have made a garland of their knowledge, wearing it round my
neck, and I have given it as an offering at the feet of the Mother."
Sri Ramakrishna used to say that when the flower blooms the bees come to it for honey
of their own accord. Now many souls began to visit Dakshineśwar to satisfy their
spiritual hunger. He, the devotee and aspirant, became the Master. Gauri, the great
scholar who had been one of the first to proclaim Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of
God, paid the Master a visit in 1870 and with the Master's blessings renounced the
world. Nārāyan Śāstri, another great pundit, who had mastered the six systems of Hindu
philosophy and had been offered a lucrative post by the Maharaja of Jaipur, met the
Master and recognized in him one who had realized in life those ideals which he himself
had encountered merely in books. Sri Ramakrishna initiated Nārāyan Śastri, at his
earnest request, into the life of sannyās. Pundit Padmalochan, the court pundit of the
Maharaja of Burdwan, well known for his scholarship in both the Vedānta and the Nyāya
systems of philosophy, accepted the Master as an Incarnation of God. Krishnakishore, a
Vedantist scholar, became devoted to the Master. And there arrived Viśwanāth
Upādhyāya, who was to become a favourite devotee; Sri Ramakrishna always addressed
45him as "Captain". He was a high officer of the King of Nepal and had received the title of
Colonel in recognition of his merit. A scholar of the Gita, the Bhāgavata, and the Vedānta
philosophy, he daily performed the worship of his Chosen Deity with great devotion. "I
have read the Vedas and the other scriptures", he said. "I have also met a good many
monks and devotees in different places. But it is in Sri Ramakrishna's presence that my
spiritual yearnings have been fulfilled. To me he seems to be the embodiment of the
truths of the scriptures."
The Knowledge of Brahman in nirvikalpa Samādhi had convinced Sri Ramakrishna that
the gods of the different religions are but so many readings of the Absolute, and that the
Ultimate Reality could never be expressed by human tongue. He understood that all
religions lead their devotees by differing paths to one and the same goal. Now he
became eager to explore some of the alien religions; for with him understanding meant
actual experience.

## Islām

Toward the end of 1866 he began to practise Islām. Under the direction of his Muslim guru, he abandoned himself to his new sādhana. He dressed as a Muslim and repeated the name of Allah.

His prayers took the form of the Islamic devotions. He forgot the Hindu gods and goddesses - even Kāli - and gave up visiting the temples. 

He took up his residence outside the temple precincts. After 3 days he saw the vision of a radiant figure, perhaps Mohammed. This figure gently approached him and finally lost himself in Sri Ramakrishna. 

Thus he realized the Muslim God. Thence he passed into communion with Brahman. The mighty river of Islam also led him back to the Ocean of the Absolute.


## Christianity

Eight years later, some time in November 1874, Sri Ramakrishna was seized with an irresistible desire to learn the truth of the Christian religion. 

He began to listen to readings from the Bible, by Śambhu Charan Mallick, a gentleman of Calcutta and a devotee of the Master. Sri Ramakrishna became fascinated by the life and teachings of Jesus. 

One day he was seated in the parlour of Jadu Mallick's garden house at Dakshineśwar, when his eyes became fixed on a painting of the Madonna and Child.
Intently watching it, he became gradually overwhelmed with divine emotion. 

The figures in the picture took on life, and the rays of light emanating from them entered his soul.

The effect of this experience was stronger than that of the vision of Mohammed. In dismay he cried out, "O Mother! What are You doing to me?" And, breaking through the
barriers of creed and religion, he entered a new realm of ecstasy. Christ possessed his soul. 

For 3 days he did not set foot in the Kāli temple. 

On the fourth day, in the afternoon, as he was walking in the Panchavati, he saw coming toward him a person with beautiful large eyes, serene countenance, and fair skin. As the two faced each other, a voice rang out in the depths of Sri Ramakrishna's soul: "Behold the Christ who shed His heart's blood for the redemption of the world, who suffered a sea of anguish for love of men. It is He, the Master Yogi, who is in eternal union with God. It is Jesus, Love Incarnate." 

The Son of Man embraced the Son of the Divine Mother and merged in him.

Sri Ramakrishna realized his identity with Christ, as he had already realized his identity with Kāli, Rāmā, Hanuman, Rādhā, Krishna, Brahman, and Mohammed. The Master went
into Samādhi and communed with the Brahman with attributes. Thus he experienced the truth that Christianity, too, was a path leading to God-Consciousness. Till the last
moment of his life he believed that Christ was an Incarnation of God. 

But Christ, for him, was not the only Incarnation; there were others - Buddha, for instance, and Krishna.


## Attitude toward Different Religions

Sri Ramakrishna accepted the divinity of Buddha and used to point out the similarity of his teachings to those of the Upanishads. He also showed great respect for the
Tirthankarās, who founded Jainism, and for the ten Gurus of Sikhism. But he did not speak of them as Divine Incarnations. 

He was heard to say that the Gurus of Sikhism were the reincarnations of King Janaka of ancient India. 

He kept in his room at Dakshineśwar a small statue of Tirthankara Mahāvira and a picture of Christ, before
which incense was burnt morning and evening.

Without being formally initiated into their doctrines, Sri Ramakrishna thus realized the ideals of religions other than Hinduism. He did not need to follow any doctrine. All
barriers were removed by his overwhelming love of God. So he became a Master who could speak with authority regarding the ideas and ideals of the various religions of the
world. "I have practised", said he, "all religions - Hinduism, Islam, Christianity - and I have also followed the paths of the different Hindu sects. I have found that it is the same God toward whom all are directing their steps, though along different paths. 

You must try all beliefs and traverse all the different ways once. Wherever I look, I see men quarrelling in the name of religion - Hindus, Mohammedans, Brahmos, Vaishnavās, and the rest. 

But they never reflect that He who is called Krishna is also called Śiva, and bears the name of the Primal Energy, Jesus, and Allah as well - the same Rāmā with a
thousand names. A lake has several G hāts . 

At one, the Hindus take water in pitchers and call it 'Jal' ; at another the Muslims take water in leather bags and call it 'pāni' . At a
third the Christians call it 'water' . Can we imagine that it is not 'jal', but only 'pāni' or
'water'? How ridiculous! The substance is One under different names, and everyone is
seeking the same substance; only climate, temperament, and name create differences.
Let each man follow his own path. If he sincerely and ardently wishes to know God,
peace be unto him! He will surely realize Him."

In 1867, Sri Ramakrishna returned to Kāmārpukur to recuperate from the effect of his austerities. The peaceful countryside, the simple and artless companions of his boyhood,
and the pure air did him much good. The villagers were happy to get back their playful, frank, witty, kind-hearted, and truthful Gadādhar, though they did not fail to notice the great change that had come over him during his years in Calcutta. His wife, Sāradā Devi, now 14 years old, soon arrived at Kāmārpukur. Her spiritual development was
much beyond her age and she was able to understand immediately her husband's state of mind. She became eager to learn from him about God and to live with him as his
attendant. The Master accepted her cheerfully both as his disciple and as his spiritual companion. Referring to the experiences of these few days, she once said: "I used to
47feel always as if a pitcher full of bliss were placed in my heart. The joy was indescribable."

## Pilgrimage

On January 27, 1868, Mathur Bābu with a party of some 125 persons set out on a pilgrimage to the sacred places of northern India. At Vaidyanāth in
Behar, when the Master saw the inhabitants of a village reduced by poverty and
starvation to mere skeletons, he requested his rich patron to feed the people and give
each a piece of cloth. Mathur demurred at the added expense. 

The Master declared bitterly that he would not go on to Banāras, but would live with the poor and share their
miseries. 

He actually left Mathur and sat down with the villagers.

Whereupon Mathur had to yield. On another occasion, two years later, Sri Ramakrishna showed a similar sentiment for the poor and needy. He accompanied Mathur on a tour to
one of the latter's estates at the time of the collection of rents. For two years the harvests had failed and the tenants were in a state of extreme poverty. The Master
asked Mathur to remit their rents, distribute help to them, and in addition give the hungry people a sumptuous feast. When Mathur grumbled, the Master said: "You are
only the steward of the Divine Mother. They are the Mother's tenants. 

You must spend the Mother's money. When they are suffering, how can you refuse to help them? You must help them." 

Again Mathur had to give in. Sri Ramakrishna's sympathy for the poor sprang from his perception of God in all created beings. His sentiment was not that of
the humanist or philanthropist. To him the service of man was the same as the worship of God.

The party entered holy Banāras by boat along the Ganges. When Sri Ramakrishna's eyes fell on this city of Śiva, where had accumulated for ages the devotion and piety of
countless worshippers, he saw it to be made of gold, as the scriptures declare. He was visibly moved. During his stay in the city he treated every particle of its earth with
utmost respect. At the Manikarnikā Ghāt, the great cremation ground of the city, he actually saw Śiva, with ash-covered body and tawny matted hair, serenely approaching
each funeral pyre and breathing into the ears of the corpses the mantra of liberation; and then the Divine Mother removing from the dead their bonds. Thus he realized the
significance of the scriptural statement that anyone dying in Banāras attains salvation through the grace of Śiva. He paid a visit to Trailanga Swāmi, the celebrated monk,
whom he later declared to be a real paramahamsa, a veritable image of Śiva.

Sri Ramakrishna visited Allahābad, at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamuna, and then proceeded to Vrindāvan and Mathura, hallowed by the legends, songs, and dramas
about Krishna and the gopis. Here he had numerous visions and his heart overflowed with divine emotion. He wept and said: "O Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the
olden days. You alone are absent." He visited the great woman saint Gangāmāyi, regarded by Vaishnava devotees as the reincarnation of an intimate attendant of Rādhā.
She was sixty years old and had frequent trances. She spoke of Sri Ramakrishna as an
incarnation of Rādhā. With great difficulty he was persuaded to leave her.

On the return journey Mathur wanted to visit Gayā, but Sri Ramakrishna declined to go.

He recalled his father's vision at Gayā before his own birth and felt that in the temple of Vishnu he would become permanently absorbed in God. Mathur, honouring the Master's
wish, returned with his party to Calcutta. 

From Vrindāvan the Master had brought a handful of dust. Part of this he scattered in the Panchavati; the rest he buried in the little hut where he had practised meditation.
"Now this place", he said, "is as sacred as Vrindāvan."

In 1870 the Master went on a pilgrimage to Nadia, the birth-place of Sri Chaitanya. As
the boat by which he travelled approached the sand-bank close to Nadia, Sri
Ramakrishna had a vision of the "two brothers", Sri Chaitanya and his companion
Nityānanda, "bright as molten gold" and with haloes, rushing to greet him with uplifted
hands. "There they come! There they come!" he cried. They entered his body and he
went into a deep trance.


## Relation with His Wife

In 1872, Sāradā Devi paid her first visit to her husband at Dakshineśwar. Four years earlier she had seen him at Kāmārpukur and had tasted the bliss of his divine company.
Since then she had become even more gentle, tender, introspective, serious, and unselfish. 

She had heard many rumours about her husband's insanity. People had shown her pity in her misfortune. The more she thought, the more she felt that her duty was to
be with him, giving him, in whatever measure she could, a wife's devoted service. She was now eighteen years old. Accompanied by her father, she arrived at Dakshineśwar,
having come on foot the distance of eighty miles. She had had an attack of fever on the way. When she arrived at the temple garden the Master said sorrowfully: "Ah! You have
come too late. My Mathur is no longer here to look after you." Mathur had passed away the previous year.

The Master took up the duty of instructing his young wife, and this included everything from housekeeping to the Knowledge of Brahman. He taught her how to trim a lamp,
how to behave toward people according to their differing temperaments, and how to conduct herself before visitors. He instructed her in the mysteries of spiritual life -
prayer, meditation, japa, deep contemplation, and Samādhi. 

The first lesson that Sāradā Devi received was: "God is everybody's Beloved, just as the moon is dear to every child.
Everyone has the same right to pray to Him. Out of His grace He reveals Himself to all
who call upon Him. 

You too will see Him if you but pray to Him."

Totāpuri, coming to know of the Master's marriage, had once remarked: "What does it matter? He alone is firmly established in the Knowledge of Brahman who can adhere to
his spirit of discrimination and renunciation even while living with his wife. He alone has attained the supreme illumination who can look on man and woman alike as Brahman. A man with the idea of sex may be a good aspirant, but he is still far from the goal." 

Sri Ramakrishna and his wife lived together at Dakshineśwar, but their minds always soared above the worldly plane. A few months after Sāradā Devi's arrival Sri Ramakrishna
arranged, on an auspicious day, a special worship of Kāli, the Divine Mother. Instead of 49an image of the Deity, he placed on the seat the living image, Sāradā Devi herself. 

The worshipper and the worshipped went into deep Samādhi and in the transcendental plane their souls were united. After several hours Sri Ramakrishna came down again to the
relative plane, sang a hymn to the Great Goddess, and surrendered, at the feet of the living image, himself, his rosary, and the fruit of his life-long sādhana. This is known in Tantra as the Shodasi Puja, the "Adoration of Woman". Sri Ramakrishna realized the significance of the great statement of the Upanishad: "O Lord, Thou art the woman,
Thou art the man; Thou art the boy, Thou art the girl; Thou art the old, tottering on their crutches. Thou pervadest the universe in its multiple forms."
By his marriage Sri Ramakrishna admitted the great value of marriage in man's spiritual evolution, and by adhering to his monastic vows he demonstrated the imperative
necessity of self-control, purity, and continence, in the realization of God. 

By his unique spiritual relationship with his wife he proved that husband and wife can live together as spiritual companions. Thus his life is a synthesis of the ways of life of the householder and the monk.

## The "Ego" of the Master

In the nirvikalpa Samādhi Sri Ramakrishna had realized that Brahman alone is real and
the world illusory. By keeping his mind six months on the plane of the non-dual
Brahman, he had attained to the state of the Vijnani, the Knower of Truth in a special
and very rich sense, who sees Brahman not only in himself and in the transcendental
Absolute, but in everything of the world. In this state of Vijnāna, sometimes, bereft of
body-consciousness, he would regard himself as one with Brahman; sometimes,
conscious of the dual world, he would regard himself as God's devotee, servant, or child.
In order to enable the Master to work for the welfare of humanity, the Divine Mother had
kept in him a trace of ego, which he described - according to his mood - as the "ego of
Knowledge", the "ego of Devotion", the "ego of a child", or the "ego of a servant". In any
case this ego of the Master, consumed by the fire of the Knowledge of Brahman, was an
appearance only, like a burnt string. He often referred to this ego as the "ripe ego" in
contrast with the ego of the bound soul, which he described as the "unripe" or "green"
ego. The ego of the bound soul identifies itself with the body, relatives, possessions, and
the world; but the "ripe ego", illumined by Divine Knowledge, knows the body, relatives,
possessions, and the world to be unreal and establishes a relationship of love with God
alone. Through this "ripe ego" Sri Ramakrishna dealt with the world and his wife. One
day, while stroking his feet, Sāradā Devi asked the Master, "What do you think of me?"
Quick came the answer: "The Mother who is worshipped in the temple is the mother who
has given birth to my body and is now living in the Nahabat, and it is She again who is
stroking my feet at this moment. Indeed, I always look on you as the personification of
the Blissful Mother Kāli."
Sāradā Devi, in the company of her husband, had rare spiritual experiences. She said: "I
have no words to describe my wonderful exaltation of spirit as I watched him in his
different moods. Under the influence of divine emotion he would sometimes talk on
abstruse subjects, sometimes laugh, sometimes weep, and sometimes become perfectly
motionless in Samādhi. This would continue throughout the night. There was such an
50extraordinary divine presence in him that now and then I would shake with fear and
wonder how the night would pass. Months went by in this way. Then one day he
discovered that I had to keep awake the whole night lest, during my sleep, he should go
into Samādhi - for it might happen at any moment -, and so he asked me to sleep in the
Nahabat."
Summary of the Master's Spiritual Experiences
We have now come to the end of Sri Ramakrishna's sādhana, the period of his spiritual
discipline. As a result of his supersensuous experiences he reached certain conclusions
regarding himself and spirituality in general. His conclusions about himself may be
summarised as follows:
First, he was an Incarnation of God, a specially commissioned person, whose spiritual
experiences were for the benefit of humanity. Whereas it takes an ordinary man a whole
life's struggle to realize one or two phases of God, he had in a few years realized God in
all His phases.
Second, he knew that he had always been a free soul, that the various disciplines
through which he had passed were really not necessary for his own liberation but were
solely for the benefit of others. Thus the terms liberation and bondage were not
applicable to him. As long as there are beings who consider themselves bound, God
must come down to earth as an Incarnation to free them from bondage, just as a
magistrate must visit any part of his district in which there is trouble.
Third, he came to foresee the time of his death. His words with respect to this matter
were literally fulfilled.
About spirituality in general the following were his conclusions :
First, he was firmly convinced that all religions are true, that every doctrinal system
represents a path to God. He had followed all the main paths and all had led him to the
same goal. He was the first religious prophet recorded in history to preach the harmony
of religions.
Second, the three great systems of thought known as Dualism, Qualified Non-dualism,
and Absolute Non-dualism - Dvaita, Visishtādvaita, and Advaita - he perceived to
represent three stages in man's progress toward the Ultimate Reality. They were not
contradictory but complementary and suited to different temperaments. For the ordinary
man with strong attachment to the senses, a dualistic form of religion, prescribing a
certain amount of material support, such as music and other symbols, is useful. A man
of God-realization transcends the idea of worldly duties, but the ordinary mortal must
perform his duties, striving to be unattached and to surrender the results to God. The
mind can comprehend and describe the range of thought and experience up to the
Viśiśtādvaita, and no further. The Advaita, the last word in spiritual experience, is
something to be felt in Samādhi, for it transcends mind and speech. From the highest
standpoint, the Absolute and Its manifestation are equally real - the Lord's Name, His
51Abode, and the Lord Himself are of the same spiritual Essence. Everything is Spirit, the
difference being only in form.
Third, Sri Ramakrishna realized the wish of the Divine Mother that through him She
should found a new Order, consisting of those who would uphold the universal doctrines
illustrated in his life.
Fourth, his spiritual insight told him that those who were having their last birth on the
mortal plane of existence and those who had sincerely called on the Lord even once in
their lives must come to him.
During this period Sri Ramakrishna suffered several bereavements. The first was the
death of a nephew named, Akshay. After the young man's death Sri Ramakrishna said:
"Akshay died before my very eyes. But it did not affect me in the least. I stood by and
watched a man die. It was like a sword being drawn from its scabbard. I enjoyed the
scene, and laughed and sang and danced over it. They removed the body and cremated
it. But the next day as I stood there (pointing to the southeast verandah of his room), I
felt a racking pain for the loss of Akshay, as if somebody were squeezing my heart like a
wet towel. I wondered at it and thought that the Mother was teaching me a lesson. I was
not much concerned even with my own body - much less with a relative. But if such was
my pain at the loss of a nephew, how much more must be the grief of the householders
at the loss of their near and dear ones!" In 1871 Mathur died, and some five years later
Śambhu Mallick - who, after Mathur's passing away, had taken care of the Master's
comfort. In 1873 died his elder brother Rāmeśwar, and in 1876, his beloved mother.
These bereavements left their imprint on the tender human heart of Sri Ramakrishna
albeit he had realized the immortality of the soul and the illusoriness of birth and death.
In March 1875, about a year before the death of his mother, the Master met Keshab
Chandra Sen. The meeting was a momentous event for both Sri Ramakrishna and
Keshab. Here the Master for the first time came into actual contact with a worthy
representative of modern India.

## Brāhmo Samāj

Keshab was the leader of the Brāhmo Samāj, one of the two great movements that, during the latter part of the nineteenth century, played an important part in shaping the
course of the renascence of India. The founder of the Brāhmo movement had been the great Rājā Rāmmohan Roy (1774-1833). Though born in an orthodox brāhmin family,
Rāmmohan Roy had shown great sympathy for Islam and Christianity. 

He had gone to Tibet in search of the Buddhist mysteries. He had extracted from Christianity its ethical system, but had rejected the divinity of Christ as he had denied the Hindu Incarnations. 

The religion of Islam influenced him, to a great extent, in the formulation of his monotheistic doctrines. But he always went back to the Vedas for his spiritual
inspiration. The Brāhmo Samāj, which he founded in 1828, was dedicated to the "worship and adoration of the Eternal, the Unsearchable, the Immutable Being, who is
the Author and Preserver of the Universe". The Samāj was open to all without distinction
of colour, creed, caste, nation, or religion.

The real organizer of the Samāj was Devendranāth Tāgore (1817-1905), the father of the poet Rabindranāth. His physical and spiritual beauty, aristocratic aloofness,
penetrating intellect, and poetic sensibility made him the foremost leader of the educated Bengālis. These addressed him by the respectful epithet of Maharshi, the
"Great Seer". The Maharshi was a Sanskrit scholar and, unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy, drew his inspiration entirely from the Upanishads. He was an implacable enemy of image
worship and also fought to stop the infiltration of Christian ideas into the Samāj. 

He gave the movement its faith and ritual. Under his influence the Brāhmo Samāj professed One Self-existent Supreme Being who had created the universe out of nothing, the God of Truth, Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, the Eternal and Omnipotent, the One without a Second. Man should love Him and do His will, believe in Him and worship Him,
and thus merit salvation in the world to come. 

By far the ablest leader of the Brāhmo movement was Keshab Chandra Sen (1838-1884). Unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy and Devendranāth Tāgore, Keshab was born of a
middle-class Bengāli family and had been brought up in an English school. 

He did not
know Sanskrit and very soon broke away from the popular Hindu religion. Even at an
early age he came under the spell of Christ and professed to have experienced the
special favour of John the Baptist, Christ, and St. Paul. When he strove to introduce
Christ to the Brāhmo Samāj, a rupture became inevitable with Devendranāth. In 1868
Keshab broke with the older leader and founded the Brāhmo Samāj of India, Devendra
retaining leadership of the first Brāhmo Samāj, now called the Ādi Samāj.
Keshab possessed a complex nature. When passing through a great moral crisis, he
spent much of his time in solitude and felt that he heard the voice of God. When a
devotional form of worship was introduced into the Brāhmo Samāj, he spent hours in
singing kirtan with his followers. He visited England in 1870 and impressed the English
people with his musical voice, his simple English, and his spiritual fervour. He was
entertained by Queen Victoria. Returning to India, he founded centres of the Brāhmo
Samāj in various parts of the country. Not unlike a professor of comparative religion in a
European university, he began to discover, about the time of his first contact with Sri
Ramakrishna, the harmony of religions. He became sympathetic toward the Hindu gods
and goddesses, explaining them in a liberal fashion. Further, he believed that he was
called by God to dictate to the world God's newly revealed law, the New Dispensation,
the Nava-vidhān.

In 1878 a schism divided Keshab's Samāj. Some of his influential followers accused him of infringing the Brāhmo principles by marrying his daughter to a wealthy man before
she had attained the marriageable age approved by the Samāj. This group seceded and established the Sādhāran Brāhmo Samāj, Keshab remaining the leader of the
Navavidhān. Keshab now began to be drawn more and more toward the Christ ideal, though under the influence of Sri Ramakrishna his devotion to the Divine Mother also
deepened. His mental oscillation between Christ and the Divine Mother of Hinduism found no position of rest. In Bengāl and some other parts of India the Brāhmo
movement took the form of Unitarian Christianity, scoffed at Hindu rituals, and preached a crusade against image worship. Influenced by Western culture, it declared the
53supremacy of reason, advocated the ideals of the French Revolution, abolished the caste-system among, its own members, stood for the emancipation of women, agitate
for the abolition of early marriage, sanctioned the remarriage of widows, and encouraged various educational and social-reform movements. The immediate effect of
the Brāhmo movement in Bengāl was the checking of the proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries. It also raised Indian culture in the estimation of its English
masters. But it was an intellectual and eclectic religious ferment born of the necessity of the time. Unlike Hinduism, it was not founded on the deep inner experiences of sages and prophets. 

Its influence was confined to a comparatively few educated men and women of the country, and the vast masses of the Hindus remained outside it. It
sounded monotonously only one of the notes in the rich gamut of the Eternal Religion of
the Hindus.

## Ārya Samāj

The other movement playing an important part in the nineteenth-century religious
revival of India was the Ārya Samāj. The Brāhmo Samāj, essentially a movement of
compromise with European culture, tacitly admitted the superiority of the West. But the
founder of the Ārya Samāj was a pugnacious Hindu sannyāsi who accepted the challenge
of Islam and Christianity and was resolved to combat all foreign influence in India.
Swāmi Dayānanda (1824-1883) launched this movement in Bombay in 1875, and soon
its influence was felt throughout western India. The Swāmi was a great scholar of the
Vedas, which he explained as being strictly mono-theistic. He preached against the
worship of images and re-established the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites. According to him
the Vedas were the ultimate authority on religion, and he accepted every word of them
as literally true. The Ārya Samāj became a bulwark against the encroachments of Islam
and Christianity, and its orthodox flavour appealed to many Hindu minds. It also
assumed leadership in many movements of social reform. The caste-system became a
target of its attack. Women it liberated from many of their social disabilities. The cause
of education received from it a great impetus. It started agitation against early marriage
and advocated the remarriage of Hindu widows. Its influence was strongest in the
Punjab, the battle-ground of the Hindu and Islamic cultures. A new fighting attitude was
introduced into the slumbering Hindu society. Unlike the Brāhmo Samāj, the influence of
the Ārya Samāj was not confined to the intellectuals. It was a force that spread to the
masses. It was a dogmatic movement intolerant of those disagreed with its views, and it
emphasized only one way, the Ārya Samāj way, to the realization of Truth. Sri
Ramakrishna met Swāmi Dayānanda when the latter visited Bengāl.

## Keshab Chandra Sen

Keshab Chandra Sen and Sri Ramakrishna met for the first time in the garden house of Jaygopāl Sen at Belgharia, a few miles from Dakshineśwar, where the great Brāhmo
leader was staying with some of his disciples. In many respects the two were poles apart, though an irresistible inner attraction was to make them intimate friends. The
Master had realized God as Pure Spirit and Consciousness, but he believed in the various
forms of God as well. Keshab, on the other hand, regarded image worship as idolatry and gave allegorical explanations of the Hindu deities. Keshab was an orator and a writer
of books and magazine articles; Sri Ramakrishna had a horror of lecturing and hardly 54knew how to write his own name. Keshab's fame spread far and wide, even reaching the
distant shores of England; the Master still led a secluded life in the village of Dakshineśwar. Keshab emphasized social reforms for India's regeneration; to Sri
Ramakrishna God-realization was the only goal of life. 

Keshab considered himself a disciple of Christ and accepted in a diluted form the Christian sacraments and Trinity; Sri
Ramakrishna was the simple child of Kāli, the Divine Mother, though he too, in a
different way, acknowledged Christ's divinity. Keshab was a house-holder and took a real
interest in the welfare of his children, whereas Sri Ramakrishna was a paramahamsa and
completely indifferent to the life of the world. Yet, as their acquaintance ripened into
friendship, Sri Ramakrishna and Keshab held each other in great love and respect. Years
later, at the news of Keshab's death, the Master felt as if half his body had become
paralysed. Keshab's concepts of the harmony of religions and the Motherhood of God
were deepened and enriched by his contact with Sri Ramakrishna.

Sri Ramakrishna, dressed in a red-bordered dhoti, one end of which was carelessly thrown over his left shoulder, came to Jaygopal's garden house accompanied by Hriday.
No one took notice of the unostentatious visitor. Finally the Master said to Keshab, "People tell me you have seen God; so I have come to hear from you about God." A
magnificent conversation followed. The Master sang a thrilling song about Kāli and forthwith went into Samādhi. When Hriday uttered the sacred "Om" in his ears, he
gradually came back to consciousness of the world, his face still radiating a divine brilliance. Keshab and his followers were amazed. The contrast between Sri Ramakrishna
and the Brāhmo devotees was very interesting. There sat this small man, thin and extremely delicate. His eyes were illumined with an inner light. Good humour gleamed in
his eyes and lurked in the corners of his mouth. His speech was Bengāli of a homely kind with a slight, delightful stammer, and his words held men enthralled by their wealth of spiritual experience, their inexhaustible store of simile and metaphor, their power of observation, their bright and subtle humour, their wonderful catholicity, their ceaseless flow of wisdom. And around him now were the sophisticated men of Bengāl, the best products of Western education, with Keshab, the idol of young Bengāl, as their leader.

Keshab's sincerity was enough for Sri Ramakrishna. Henceforth the two saw each other
frequently, either at Dakshineśwar or at the temple of the Brāhmo Samāj. Whenever the
Master was in the temple at the time of divine service, Keshab would request him to
speak to the congregation. And Keshab would visit the saint, in his turn, with offerings of
flowers and fruits.
Other Brāhmo Leaders
Gradually other Brāhmo leaders began to feel Sri Ramakrishna's influence. But they were
by no means uncritical admirers of the Master. They particularly disapproved of his
ascetic renunciation and condemnation of, "woman and gold".7 They measured him
according to their own ideals of the householder's life. Some could not understand his
Samādhi and described it as a nervous malady. Yet they could not resist his magnetic
personality.
55Among the Brāhmo leaders who knew the Master closely were Pratāp Chandra
Mazumdār, Vijay Krishna Goswāmi, Trailokyanāth Sannyāl and Śivanāth Śastri.
Śivanāth, one day, was greatly impressed by the Master's utter simplicity and
abhorrence of praise. He was seated with Sri Ramakrishna in the latter's room when
several rich men of Calcutta arrived. The Master left the room for a few minutes. In the
mean time Hriday, his nephew, began to describe his Samādhi to the visitors. The last
few words caught the Master's ear as he entered the room. He said to Hriday: "What a
mean-spirited fellow you must be to extol me thus before these rich men! You have seen
their costly apparel and their gold watches and chains, and your object is to get from
them as much money as you can. What do I care about what they think of me? (Turning
to the gentlemen) No, my friends, what he has told you about me is not true. It was not
love of God that made me absorbed in God and indifferent to external life. I became
positively insane for some time. The sādhus who frequented this temple told me to
practise many things. I tried to follow them, and the consequence was that my
austerities drove me to insanity." This is a quotation from one of Śivanāth's books. He
took the Master's words literally and failed to see their real import.
Śivanāth vehemently criticized the Master for his other-worldly attitude toward his wife.
He writes: "Ramakrishna was practically separated from his wife, who lived in her village
home. One day when I was complaining to some friends about the virtual widowhood of
his wife, he drew me to one side and whispered in my ear: 'Why do you complain? It is
no longer possible; it is all dead and gone.' Another day as I was inveighing against this
part of his teaching, and also declaring that our program of work in the Brāhmo Samāj
includes women, that ours is a social and domestic religion, and that we want to give
education and social liberty to women, the saint became very much excited, as was his
way when anything against his settled conviction was asserted - a trait we so much liked
in him - and exclaimed, 'Go, thou fool, go and perish in the pit that your women will dig
for you.' Then he glared at me and said: 'What does a gardener do with a young plant?
Does he not surround it with a fence, to protect it from goats and cattle? And when the
young plant has grown up into a tree and it can no longer be injured by cattle, does he
not remove the fence and let the tree grow freely?' I replied, 'Yes, that is the custom
with gardeners.' Then he remarked, 'Do the same in your spiritual life; become strong,
be full-grown; then you may seek them.' To which I replied, 'I don't agree with you in
thinking that women's work is like that of cattle, destructive; they are our associates and
helpers in our spiritual struggles and social progress' - a view with which he could not
agree, and he marked his dissent by shaking his head. Then referring to the lateness of
the hour he jocularly remarked, 'It is time for you to depart; take care, do not be late;
otherwise your woman will not admit you into her room.' This evoked hearty laughter."
Pratāp Chandra Mazumdār, the right-hand man of Keshab and an accomplished Brāhmo
preacher in Europe and America, bitterly criticized Sri Ramakrishna's use of uncultured
language and also his austere attitude toward his wife. But he could not escape the spell
of the Master's personality. In the course of an article about Sri Ramakrishna, Pratāp
wrote in the "Theistic Quarterly Review": "What is there in common between him and
me? I, a Europeanized, civilized, self-centered, semi-sceptical, so-called educated
56reasoner, and he, a poor, illiterate, unpolished, half-idolatrous, friendless Hindu devotee?
Why should I sit long hours to attend to him, I, who have listened to Disraeli and
Fawcett, Stanley and Max Muller, and a whole host of European scholars and divines? …
And it is not I only, but dozens like me, who do the same. … He worships Śiva, he
worships Kāli, he worships Rāmā, he worships Krishna, and is a confirmed advocate of
Vedāntic doctrines. … He is an idolater, yet is a faithful and most devoted Meditator on
the perfections of the One Formless, Absolute, Infinite Deity. … His religion is ecstasy,
his worship means transcendental insight, his whole nature burns day and night with a
permanent fire and fever of a strange faith and feeling. … So long as he is spared to us,
gladly shall we sit at his feet to learn from him the sublime precepts of purity,
unworldliness, spirituality, and inebriation in the love of God. … He, by his childlike
bhakti, by his strong conceptions of an ever-ready Motherhood, helped to unfold it [God
as our Mother] in our minds wonderfully. … By associating with him we learnt to realize
better the divine attributes as scattered over the three hundred and thirty millions of
deities of mythological India, the gods of the Purānās."
The Brāhmo leaders received much inspiration from their contact with Sri Ramakrishna.
It broadened their religious views and kindled in their hearts the yearning for God-
realization; it made them understand and appreciate the rituals and symbols of Hindu
religion, convinced them of the manifestation of God in diverse forms, and deepened
their thoughts about the harmony of religions. The Master, too, was impressed by the
sincerity of many of the, Brāhmo devotees. He told them about his own realizations and
explained to them the essence of his teachings, such as the necessity of renunciation,
sincerity in the pursuit of one's own course of discipline, faith in God, the performance of
one's duties without thought of results, and discrimination between the Real and the
unreal.
This contact with the educated and progressive Bengālis opened Sri Ramakrishna's eyes
to a new realm of thought. Born and brought up in a simple village, without any formal
education, and taught by the orthodox holy men of India in religious life, he had had no
opportunity to study the influence of modernism on the thoughts and lives of the Hindus.
He could not properly estimate the result of the impact of Western education on Indian
culture. He was a Hindu of the Hindus, renunciation being to him the only means to the
realization of God in life. From the Brahmos he learnt that the new generation of India
made a compromise between God and the world. Educated young men were influenced
more by the Western philosophers than by their own prophets. But Sri Ramakrishna was
not dismayed, for he saw in this, too, the hand of God. And though he expounded to the
Brahmos all his ideas about God and austere religious disciplines, yet he bade them
accept from his teachings only as much as suited their tastes and temperaments.
The Master's Yearning for His Own Devotees
Contact with the Brahmos increased Sri Ramakrishna's longing to encounter aspirants
who would be able to follow his teachings in their purest form. "There was no limit", he
once declared, "to the longing I felt at that time. During the day-time I somehow
managed to control it. The secular talk of the worldly-minded was galling to me, and I
would look wistfully to the day when my own beloved companions would come. I hoped
57to find solace in conversing with them and relating to them my own realizations. Every
little incident would remind me of them, and thoughts of them wholly engrossed me. I
was already arranging in my mind what I should say to one and give to another, and so
on. But when the day would come to a close I would not be able to curb my feelings. The
thought that another day had gone by, and they had not come, oppressed me. When,
during the evening service, the temples rang with the sound of bells and conch-shells, I
would climb to the roof of the Kuthi in the garden and, writhing in anguish of heart, cry
at the top of my voice: 'Come, my children! Oh, where are you? I cannot bear to live
without you.' A mother never longed so intensely for the sight of her child, nor a friend
for his companions, nor a lover for his sweetheart, as I longed for them. Oh, it was
indescribable! Shortly after this period of yearning the devotees began to come."
In the year 1879 occasional writings about Sri Ramakrishna by the Brahmos, in the
Brāhmo magazines, began to attract his future disciples from the educated middle-class
Bengālis, and they continued to come till 1884. But others, too, came, feeling the subtle
power of his attraction. They were an ever shifting crowd of people of all castes and
creeds: Hindus and Brahmos, Vaishnavas and Śāktās, the educated with university
degrees and the illiterate, old and young, maharajas and beggars, journalists and artists,
pundits and devotees, philosophers and the worldly-minded, jnānis and yogis, men of
action and men of faith, virtuous women and prostitutes, office-holders and vagabonds,
philanthropists and self-seekers, dramatists and drunkards, builders-up and pullers-
down. He gave to them all, without stint, from his illimitable store of realization. No one
went away empty-handed. He taught them the lofty knowledge of the Vedānta and the
soul-melting love of the Purānā. Twenty hours out of twenty-four he would speak
without rest or respite. He gave to all his sympathy and enlightenment, and he touched
them with that strange power of the soul which could not but melt even the most
hardened. And people understood him according to their powers of comprehension.
The Master's Method of Teaching
But he remained as ever the willing instrument in the hand of God, the child of the
Divine Mother, totally untouched by the idea of being a teacher. He used to say that
three ideas - that he was a guru, a father, and a master - pricked his flesh like thorns.
Yet he was an extraordinary teacher. He stirred his disciples' hearts more by a subtle
influence than by actions or words. He never claimed to be the founder of a religion or
the organizer of a sect. Yet he was a religious dynamo. He was the verifier of all religions
and creeds. He was like an expert gardener, who prepares the soil and removes the
weeds, knowing that the plants will grow because of the inherent power of the seeds,
producing each its appropriate flowers and fruits. He never thrust his ideas on anybody.
He understood people's limitations and worked on the principle that what is good for one
may be bad for another. He had the unusual power of knowing the devotees' minds,
even their inmost souls, at the first sight. He accepted disciples with the full knowledge
of their past tendencies and future possibilities. The life of evil did not frighten him, nor
did religious squeamishness raise anybody in his estimation. He saw in everything the
unerring finger of the Divine Mother. Even the light that leads astray was to him the light
from God.
58To those who became his intimate disciples the Master was a friend, companion, and
playmate. Even the chores of religious discipline would be lightened in his presence. The
devotees would be so inebriated with pure joy in his company that they would have no
time to ask themselves whether he was an Incarnation, a perfect soul, or a yogi. His
very presence was a great teaching; words were superfluous. In later years his disciples
remarked that while they were with him they would regard him as a comrade, but
afterwards would tremble to think of their frivolities in the presence of such a great
person. They had convincing proof that the Master could, by his mere wish, kindle in
their hearts the love of God and give them His vision.
Through all this fun and frolic, this merriment and frivolity, he always kept before them
the shining ideal of God-Consciousness and the path of renunciation. He prescribed
ascents steep or graded according to the powers of the climber. He permitted no
compromise with the basic principles of purity. An aspirant had to keep his body, mind,
senses, and soul unspotted; had to have a sincere love for God and an ever mounting
spirit of yearning. The rest would be done by the Mother.
His disciples were of two kinds: the householders, and the young men, some of whom
were later to become monks. There was also a small group of women devotees.
House Holder Devotees
For the householders Sri Ramakrishna did not prescribe the hard path of total
renunciation. He wanted them to discharge their obligations to their families. Their
renunciation was to be mental. Spiritual life could not he acquired by flying away from
responsibilities. A married couple should live like brother and sister after the birth of one
or two children, devoting their time to spiritual talk and contemplation. He encouraged
the householders, saying that their life was, in a way, easier than that of the monk,
since it was more advantageous to fight the enemy from inside a fortress than in an
open field. He insisted, however, on their repairing into solitude every now and then to
strengthen their devotion and faith in God through prayer, japa, and meditation. He
prescribed for them the companionship of sādhus . He asked them to perform their
worldly duties with one hand, while holding to God with the other, and to pray to God to
make their duties fewer and fewer so that in the end they might cling to Him with both
hands. He would discourage in both the householders and the celibate youths any
lukewarmness in their spiritual struggles. He would not ask them to follow
indiscriminately the ideal of non-resistance, which ultimately makes a coward of the
unwary.
Future Monks
But to the young men destined to be monks he pointed out the steep path of
renunciation, both external and internal. They must take the vow of absolute continence
and eschew all thought of greed and lust. By the practice of continence, aspirants
develop a subtle nerve through which they understand the deeper mysteries of God. For
them self-control is final, imperative, and absolute. The sannyāsis are teachers of men,
and their lives should be totally free from blemish. They must not even look at a picture
which may awaken their animal passions. The Master selected his future monks from
59young men untouched by "woman and gold" and plastic enough to be cast in his spiritual
mould. When teaching them the path of renunciation and discrimination, he would not
allow the householders to be any where near them.
Rām and Manomohan
The first two householder devotees to come to Dakshineśwar were Rām Chandra Dutta
and Manomohan Mitra. A medical practitioner and chemist, Rām was sceptical about God
and religion and never enjoyed peace of soul. He wanted tangible proof of God's
existence. The Master said to him: "God really exists. You don't see the stars in the day-
time, but that doesn't mean that the stars do not exist. There is butter in milk. But can
anybody see it by merely looking at the milk? To get butter you must churn milk in a
quiet and cool place. You cannot realize God by a mere wish; you must go through some
mental disciplines." By degrees the Master awakened Rām's spirituality and the latter
became one of his foremost lay disciples. It was Rām who introduced Narendranāth to
Sri Ramakrishna. Narendra was a relative of Rām.
Manomohan at first met with considerable opposition from his wife and other relatives,
who resented his visits to Dakshineśwar. But in the end the unselfish love of the Master
triumphed over worldly affection. It was Manomohan who brought Rākhāl to the Master.
Surendra
Suresh Mitra, a beloved disciple whom the Master often addressed as Surendra, had
received an English education and held an important post in an English firm. Like many
other educated young men of the time, he prided himself on his atheism and led a
Bohemian life. He was addicted to drinking. He cherished an exaggerated notion about
man's free will. A victim of mental depression, he was brought to Sri Ramakrishna by
Rāmchandra Dutta. When he heard the Master asking a disciple to practise the virtue of
self-surrender to God, he was impressed. But though he tried thenceforth to do so, he
was unable to give up his old associates and his drinking. One day the Master said in his
presence, "Well, when a man goes to an undesirable place, why doesn't he take the
Divine Mother with him?" And to Surendra himself Sri Ramakrishna said: "Why should
you drink wine as wine? Offer it to Kāli, and then take it as Her Prasād, as consecrated
drink. But see that you don't, become intoxicated; you must not reel and your thoughts
must not wander. At first you will feel ordinary excitement, but soon you will experience
spiritual exaltation." Gradually Surendra's entire life was changed. The Master
designated him as one of those commissioned by the Divine Mother to defray a great
part of his expenses. Surendra's purse was always open for the Master's comfort.
Kedār
Kedarnāth Chatterji was endowed with a spiritual temperament and had tried various
paths of religion, some not very commendable. When he met the Master at
Dakshineśwar he understood the true meaning of religion. It is said that the Master,
weary of instructing devotees who were coming to him in great numbers for guidance,
once prayed to the Goddess Kāli: "Mother, I am tired of speaking to people. Please give
power to Kedār, Girish, Rām, Vijay, and Mahendra to give them the preliminary
instruction, so that just a little teaching from me will be enough." He was aware,
60however, of Kedār's lingering attachment to worldly things and often warned him about
it.
Harish
Harish, a young man in affluent circumstances, renounced his family and took shelter
with the Master, who loved him for his sincerity, singleness of purpose, and quiet nature.
He spent his leisure time in prayer and meditation, turning a deaf ear to the entreaties
and threats of his relatives. Referring to his undisturbed peace of mind, the Master would
say: "Real men are dead to the world though, living. Look at Harish. He is an example."
When one day the Master asked him to be a little kind to his wife, Harish said: "You
must excuse me on this point. This is not the place to show kindness. If I try to be
sympathetic to her, there is a possibility of my forgetting the ideal and becoming
entangled in the world."
Bhavanāth
Bhavanāth Chatterji visited the Master while he was still in his teens. His parents and
relatives regarded Sri Ramakrishna as an insane person and tried their utmost to
prevent him from becoming intimate with the Master. But the young boy was very
stubborn and often spent nights at Dakshineśwar. He was greatly attached to Narendra,
and the Master encouraged their friendship. The very sight of him often awakened Sri
Ramakrishna's spiritual emotion.
Balarām Bose
Balarām Bose came of a wealthy Vaishnava family. From his youth he had shown a deep
religious temperament and had devoted his time to meditation, prayer, and the study of
the Vaishnava scriptures. He was very much impressed by Sri Ramakrishna even at their
first meeting. He asked Sri Ramakrishna whether God really existed and, if so, whether a
man could realize Him. The Master said: "God reveals Himself to the devotee who thinks
of Him as his nearest and dearest. Because you do not draw response by praying to Him
once, you must not conclude that He does not exist. Pray to God, thinking of Him as
dearer than your very self. He is much attached to His devotees. He comes to a man
even before He is sought. There is none more intimate and affectionate than God."
Balarām had never before heard God spoken of in such forceful words; every one of the
words seemed true to him. Under the Master's influence he outgrew the conventions of
the Vaishnava worship and became one of the most beloved of the disciples. It was at
his home that the Master slept whenever he spent a night in Calcutta.
Mahendra or M.
Mahendranāth Gupta, known as "M.", arrived at Dakshineśwar in February 1882. He
belonged to the Brāhmo Samāj and was headmaster of the Vidyāsāgar High School at
Śyāmbazār, Calcutta. At the very first sight the Master recognized him as one of his
"marked" disciples. Mahendra recorded in his diary Sri Ramakrishna's conversations with
his devotees. These are the first directly recorded words, in the spiritual history of the
world, of a man recognized as belonging in the class of Buddha and Christ. The present
volume is a translation of this diary. Mahendra was instrumental, through his personal
contacts, in spreading the Master's message among many young and aspiring souls.
61Nāg Mahāshay
Durgācharan Nāg, also known as Nāg Mahāshay, was the ideal householder among the
lay disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was the embodiment of the Master's ideal of life in
the world, unstained by worldliness. In spite of his intense desire to become a sannyāsi,
Sri Ramakrishna asked him to live in the world in the spirit of a monk, and the disciple
truly carried out this injunction. He was born of a poor family and even during his
boyhood often sacrificed everything to lessen the sufferings of the needy. He had
married at an early age and after his wife's death had married a second time to obey his
father's command. But he once said to his wife: "Love on the physical level never lasts.
He is indeed blessed who can give his love to God with his whole heart. Even a little
attachment to the body endures for several births. So do not be attached to this cage of
bone and flesh. Take shelter at the feet of the Mother and think of Her alone. Thus your
life here and hereafter will he ennobled." The Master spoke of him as a "blazing light".
He received every word of Sri Ramakrishna in dead earnest. One day he heard the
Master saying that it was difficult for doctors, lawyers, and brokers to make much
progress in spirituality. Of doctors he said, "If the mind clings to the tiny drops of
medicine, how can it conceive of the Infinite?" That was the end of Durgācharan's
medical practice and he threw his chest of medicines into the Ganges. Sri Ramakrishna
assured him that he would not lack simple food and clothing. He bade him serve holy
men. On being asked where he would find real holy men, the Master said that the sādhus
themselves would seek his company. No sannyāsi could have lived a more austere life
than Durgācharan.
Girish Ghosh
Girish Chandra Ghosh was a born rebel against God, a sceptic, a Bohemian, a drunkard.
He was the greatest Bengāli dramatist of his time, the father of the modern Bengāli
stage. Like other young men he had imbibed all the vices of the West. He had plunged
into a life of dissipation and had become convinced that religion was only a fraud.
Materialistic philosophy he justified as enabling one to get at least a little fun out of life.
But a series of reverses shocked him and he became eager to solve the riddle of life. He
had heard people say that in spiritual life the help of a guru was imperative and that the
guru was to be regarded as God Himself. But Girish was too well acquainted with human
nature to see perfection in a man. His first meeting with Sri Ramakrishna did not impress
him at all. He returned home feeling as if he had seen a freak at a circus; for the Master,
in a semi-conscious mood, had inquired whether it was evening, though the lamps were
burning in the room. But their paths often crossed, and Girish could not avoid further
encounters. The Master attended a performance in Girish's Star Theatre. On this
occasion, too, Girish found nothing impressive about him. One day, however, Girish
happened to see the Master dancing and singing with the devotees. He felt the contagion
and wanted to join them, but restrained himself for fear of ridicule. Another day Sri
Ramakrishna was about to give him spiritual instruction, when Girish said: "I don't want
to listen to instructions. I have myself written many instructions. They are of no use to
me. Please help me in a more tangible way if you can." This pleased the Master and he
asked Girish to cultivate faith.
62As time passed, Girish began to learn that the guru is the one who silently unfolds the
disciple's inner life. He became a steadfast devotee of the Master.
He often loaded the Master with insults, drank in his presence, and took liberties which
astounded the other devotees. But the Master knew that at heart Girish was tender,
faithful, and sincere. He would not allow Girish to give up the theatre. And when a
devotee asked him to tell Girish to give up drinking, he sternly replied: "That is none of
your business. He who has taken charge of him will look after him. Girish is a devotee of
heroic type. I tell you, drinking will not affect him." The Master knew that mere words
could not induce a man to break deep-rooted habits, but that the silent influence of love
worked miracles. Therefore he never asked him to give up alcohol, with the result that
Girish himself eventually broke the habit. Sri Ramakrishna had strengthened Girish's
resolution by allowing him to feel that he was absolutely free.
One day Girish felt depressed because he was unable to submit to any routine of
spiritual discipline. In an exalted mood the Master said to him: "All right, give me your
power of attorney. Henceforth I assume responsibility for you. You need not do
anything." Girish heaved a sigh of relief. He felt happy to think that Sri Ramakrishna had
assumed his spiritual responsibilities. But poor Girish could not then realize that he also,
on his part, had to give up his freedom and make of himself a puppet in Sri
Ramakrishna's hands. The Master began to discipline him according to this new attitude.
One day Girish said about a trifling matter, "Yes, I shall do this." "No, no!" the Master
corrected him. "You must not speak in that egotistic manner. You should say, 'God
willing, I shall do it'." Girish understood. Thenceforth he tried to give up all idea of
personal responsibility and surrender himself to the Divine Will. His mind began to dwell
constantly on Sri Ramakrishna. This unconscious meditation in time chastened his
turbulent spirit.
The householder devotees generally visited Sri Ramakrishna on Sunday afternoons and
other holidays. Thus a brotherhood was gradually formed, and the Master encouraged
their fraternal feeling. Now and then he would accept an invitation to a devotee's home,
where other devotees would also be invited. Kirtan would be arranged and they would
spend hours in dance and devotional music. The Master would go into trances or open
his heart in religious discourses and in the narration of his own spiritual experiences.
Many people who could not go to Dakshineśwar participated in these meetings and felt
blessed. Such an occasion would be concluded with a sumptuous feast.
But it was in the company of his younger devotees, pure souls yet unstained by the
touch of worldliness, that Sri Ramakrishna took greatest joy. Among the young men who
later embraced the householder's life were Nārāyan, Paltu, the younger Naren,
Tejchandra and Purna. These visited the Master sometimes against strong opposition
from home.
Purna
Purna was a lad of thirteen, whom Sri Ramakrishna described as an Iśvarakoti, a soul
born with special spiritual qualities. The Master said that Purna was the last of the group
63of brilliant devotees who, as he once had seen in a trance, would come to him for
spiritual illumination. Purna said to Sri Ramakrishna during their second meeting, "You
are God Himself incarnated in flesh and blood." Such words coming from a mere
youngster proved of what stuff the boy was made.
Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra
Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra were two devotees outstanding for their
pretentiousness and idiosyncrasies. But the Master showed them his unfailing love and
kindness, though he was aware of their shortcomings. Mahimācharan Chakravarty had
met the Master long before the arrival of the other disciples. He had had the intention of
leading a spiritual life, but a strong desire to acquire name and fame was his weakness.
He claimed to have been initiated by Totāpuri and used to say that he had been following
the path of knowledge according to his guru's instructions. He possessed a large library
of English and Sanskrit books. But though he pretended to have read them, most of the
leaves were uncut. The Master knew all his limitations, yet enjoyed listening to him
recite from the Vedas and other scriptures. He would always exhort Mahimā to meditate
on the meaning of the scriptural texts and to practise spiritual discipline.
Pratāp Hazra, a middle-aged man, hailed from a village near Kāmārpukur. He was not
altogether unresponsive to religious feelings. On a moment's impulse he had left his
home, aged mother, wife, and children, and had found shelter in the temple garden at
Dakshineśwar, where he intended to lead a spiritual life. He loved to argue, and the
Master often pointed him out as an example of barren argumentation. He was
hypercritical of others and cherished an exaggerated notion of his own spiritual
advancement. He was mischievous and often tried to upset the minds of the Master's
young disciples, criticizing them for their happy and joyous life and asking them to
devote their time to meditation. The Master teasingly compared Hazra to Jatila and
Kutila, the two women who always created obstructions in Krishna's sport with the gopis,
and said that Hazra lived at Dakshineśwar to "thicken the plot" by adding complications.
Some noted Men
Sri Ramakrishna also became acquainted with a number of people whose scholarship or
wealth entitled them everywhere to respect. He had met, a few years before,
Devendranāth Tāgore, famous all over Bengāl for his wealth, scholarship, saintly
character, and social position. But the Master found him disappointing; for, whereas Sri
Ramakrishna expected of a saint complete renunciation of the world, Devendranāth
combined with his saintliness a life of enjoyment. Sri Ramakrishna met the great poet
Michael Madhusudan, who had embraced Christianity "for the sake of his stomach". To
him the Master could not impart instruction, for the Divine Mother "pressed his tongue".
In addition he met Mahārāja Jatindra Mohan Tāgore, a titled aristocrat of Bengāl;
Kristodās Pāl, the editor, social reformer, and patriot; Iswar Chandra Vidyāsāgar,
the noted philanthropist and educator; Pundit Śaśadhar, a great champion of Hindu
orthodoxy; Aświni Kumār Dutta, a headmaster, moralist, and leader of Indian
Nationalism; and Bankim Chatterji, a deputy magistrate, novelist, and essayist, and
one of the fashioners of modern Bengāli prose. Sri Ramakrishna was not the man to be
dazzled by outward show, glory, or eloquence. A pundit without discrimination he
64regarded as a mere straw. He would search people's hearts for the light of God, and if
that was missing, he would have nothing to do with them.
Kristodās Pāl
The Europeanized Kristodās Pāl did not approve of the Master's emphasis on
renunciation and said: "Sir, this cant of renunciation has almost ruined the country. It is
for this reason that the Indians are a subject nation today. Doing good to others,
bringing education to the door of the ignorant, and above all, improving the material
conditions of the country - these should be our duty now. The cry of religion and
renunciation would, on the contrary, only weaken us. You should advise the young men
of Bengāl to resort only to such acts as will uplift the country." Sri Ramakrishna gave
him a searching look and found no divine light within. "You man of poor understanding!"
Sri Ramakrishna said sharply. "You dare to slight in these terms renunciation and piety,
which our scriptures describe as the greatest of all virtues! After reading two pages of
English you think you have come to know the world! You appear to think you are
omniscient. Well, have you seen those tiny crabs that are born in the Ganges just when
the rains set in? In this big universe you are even less significant than one of those small
creatures. How dare you talk of helping the world? The Lord will look to that. You haven't
the power in you to do it." After a pause the Master continued: "Can you explain to me
how you can work for others? I know what you mean by helping them. To feed a number
of persons, to treat them when they are sick, to construct a road or dig a well - Isn't that
all? These are good deeds, no doubt, but how trifling in comparison with the vastness of
the universe! How far can a man advance in this line? How many people can you save
from famine? Malaria has ruined a whole province; what could you do to stop its
onslaught? God alone looks after the world. Let a man first realize Him. Let a man get
the authority from God and be endowed with His power; then, and then alone, may he
think of doing good to others. A man should first be purged of all egotism. Then alone
will the Blissful Mother ask him to work for the world." Sri Ramakrishna mistrusted
philanthropy that presumed to pose as charity. He warned people against it. He saw in
most acts of philanthropy nothing but egotism, vanity, a desire for glory, a barren
excitement to kill the boredom of life, or an attempt to soothe a guilty conscience. True
charity, he taught, is the result of love of God - service to man in a spirit of worship.
Monastic Disciples
The disciples whom the Master trained for monastic life were the following:
1. Narendranāth Dutta (Swāmi Vivekānanda)
2. Nitya Niranjan Sen (Swāmi Niranjanānanda)
3. Rākhāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Brahmānanda)
4. Kāliprasād Chandra (Swāmi Abhedānanda)
5. Gopāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Advaitānanda)
6. Harināth Chattopādhyāya (Swāmi Turiyānanda)
7. Bāburām Ghosh (Swāmi Premānanda)
8. Sāradā Prasanna (Swāmi Trigunātitānanda)
9. Tāraknāth Ghoshāl (Swāmi Shivānanda)
10. Gangādhar Ghatak (Swāmi Akhandānanda)
11. Jogindranāth Choudhury (Swāmi Yogānanda)
6512. Subodh Ghosh (Swāmi Subodhānanda)
13. Śashibhushan Chakravarty (Swāmi Rāmakrishnānanda)
14. Śaratchandra Chakravarty (Swāmi Sāradānanda)
15. Hariprasanna Chatterji (Swāmi Vijnānānanda)
16. Lātu (Swāmi Adhhutānanda)
Lātu
The first of these young men to come to the Master was Lātu. Born of obscure parents,
in Behar, he came to Calcutta in search of work and was engaged by Rāmchandra Dutta
as house-boy. Learning of the saintly Sri Ramakrishna, he visited the Master at
Dakshineśwar and was deeply touched by his cordiality. When he was about to leave, the
Master asked him to take some money and return home in a boat or carriage. But Lātu
declared he had a few pennies and jingled the coins in his pocket. Sri Ramakrishna later
requested Rām to allow Lātu to stay with him permanently. Under Sri Ramakrishna's
guidance Lātu made great progress in meditation and was blessed with ecstatic visions,
but all the efforts of the Master to give him a smattering of education failed. Lātu was
very fond of kirtan and other devotional songs but remained all his life illiterate.
Rākhāl
Even before Rākhāl's coming to Dakshineśwar, the Master had had visions of him as his
spiritual son and as a playmate of Krishna at Vrindāvan. Rākhāl was born of wealthy
parents. During his childhood he developed wonderful spiritual traits and used to play at
worshipping gods and goddesses. In his teens he was married to a sister of Manomohan
Mitra, from whom he first heard of the Master. His father objected to his association with
Sri Ramakrishna but afterwards was reassured to find that many celebrated people were
visitors at Dakshineśwar. The relationship between the Master and this beloved disciple
was that of mother and child. Sri Ramakrishna allowed Rākhāl many liberties denied to
others. But he would not hesitate to chastise the boy for improper actions. At one time
Rākhāl felt a childlike jealousy because he found that other boys were receiving the
Master's affection. He soon got over it and realized his guru as the Guru of the whole
universe. The Master was worried to hear of his marriage, but was relieved to find that
his wife was a spiritual soul who would not be a hindrance to his progress.
The Elder Gopāl
Gopāl Chandra Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar at a rather advanced age and was called
the elder Gopāl. He had lost his wife, and the Master assuaged his grief. Soon he
renounced the world and devoted himself fully to meditation and prayer. Some years
later Gopāl gave the Master the ochre cloths with which the latter initiated several of his
disciples into monastic life.
Narendra
To spread his message to the four corners of the earth Sri Ramakrishna needed a strong
instrument. With his frail body and delicate limbs he could not make great journeys
across wide spaces. And such an instrument was found in Narendranāth Dutta, his
beloved Naren, later known to the world as Swāmi Vivekānanda. Even before meeting
Narendranāth, the Master had seen him in a vision as a sage, immersed in the
66meditation of the Absolute, who at Sri Ramakrishna's request had agreed to take human
birth to assist him in his work.
Narendra was born in Calcutta on January 12, 1863, of an aristocratic Kāyastha family.
His mother was steeped in the great Hindu epics, and his father, a distinguished attorney
of the Calcutta High Court, was an agnostic about religion, a friend of the poor, and a
mocker at social conventions. Even in his boyhood and youth Narendra possessed great
physical courage and presence of mind, a vivid imagination, deep power of thought,
keen intelligence, an extraordinary memory, a love of truth, a passion for purity, a spirit
of independence, and a tender heart. An expert musician, he also acquired proficiency in
physics, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, history, and literature. He grew up into an
extremely handsome young man. Even as a child he practised meditation and showed
great power of concentration. Though free and passionate in word and action, he took
the vow of austere religious chastity and never allowed the fire of purity to be
extinguished by the slightest defilement of body or soul.
As he read in college the rationalistic Western philosophers of the nineteenth century, his
boyhood faith in God and religion was unsettled. He would not accept religion on mere
faith; he wanted demonstration of God. But very soon his passionate nature discovered
that mere Universal Reason was cold and bloodless. His emotional nature, dissatisfied
with a mere abstraction, required a concrete support to help him in the hours of
temptation. He wanted an external power, a guru, who by embodying perfection in the
flesh would still the commotion of his soul. Attracted by the magnetic personality of
Keshab, he joined the Brāhmo Samāj and became a singer in its choir. But in the Samāj
he did not find the guru who could say that he had seen God.
In a state of mental conflict and torture of soul, Narendra came to Sri Ramakrishna at
Dakshineśwar. He was then eighteen years of age and had been in college two years. He
entered the Master's room accompanied by some light-hearted friends. At Sri
Ramakrishna's request he sang a few songs, pouring his whole soul into them, and the
Master went into Samādhi. A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna suddenly left his seat,
took Narendra by the hand, and led him to the screened verandah north of his room.
They were alone. Addressing Narendra most tenderly, as if he were a friend of long
acquaintance, the Master said: "Ah! You have come very late. Why have you been so
unkind as to make me wait all these days? My ears are tired of hearing the futile words
of worldly men. Oh, how I have longed to pour my spirit into the heart of someone fitted
to receive my message!" He talked thus, sobbing all the time. Then, standing before
Narendra with folded hands, he addressed him as Nārāyana, born on earth to remove
the misery of humanity. Grasping Narendra's hand, he asked him to come again, alone,
and very soon. Narendra was startled. "What is this I have come to see?" he said to
himself. "He must be stark mad. Why, I am the son of Viswanāth Dutta. How dare he
speak this way to me?"
When they returned to the room and Narendra heard the Master speaking to others, he
was surprised to find in his words an inner logic, a striking sincerity, and a convincing
proof of his spiritual nature. In answer to Narendra's question, "Sir, have you seen
67God?" the Master said: "Yes, I have seen God. I have seen Him more tangibly than I see
you. I have talked to Him more intimately than I am talking to you." Continuing, the
Master said: "But, my child, who wants to see God? People shed jugs of tears for money,
wife, and children. But if they would weep for God for only one day they would surely
see Him." Narendra was amazed. These words he could not doubt. This was the first
time he had ever heard a man saying that he had seen God. But he could not reconcile
these words of the Master with the scene that had taken place on the verandah only a
few minutes before. He concluded that Sri Ramakrishna was a monomaniac, and
returned home rather puzzled in mind.
During his second visit, about a month later, suddenly, at the touch of the Master,
Narendra felt overwhelmed and saw the walls of the room and everything around him
whirling and vanishing. "What are you doing to me?" he cried in terror. "I have my father
and mother at home." He saw his own ego and the whole universe almost swallowed in a
nameless void. With a laugh the Master easily restored him. Narendra thought he might
have been hypnotized, but he could not understand how a monomaniac could cast a
spell over the mind of a strong person like himself. He returned home more confused
than ever, resolved to be henceforth on his guard before this strange man.
But during his third visit Narendra fared no better. This time, at the Master's touch, he
lost consciousness entirely. While he was still in that state, Sri Ramakrishna questioned
him concerning his spiritual antecedents and whereabouts, his mission in this world, and
the duration of his mortal life. The answers confirmed what the Master himself had
known and inferred. Among other things, he came to know that Narendra was a sage
who had already attained perfection, and that the day he learnt his real nature he would
give up his body in yoga, by an act of will.
A few more meetings completely removed from Narendra's mind the last traces of the
notion that Sri Ramakrishna might be a monomaniac or wily hypnotist. His integrity,
purity, renunciation, and unselfishness were beyond question. But Narendra could not
accept a man, an imperfect mortal, as his guru. As a member of the Brāhmo Samāj, he
could not believe that a human intermediary was necessary between man and God.
Moreover, he openly laughed at Sri Ramakrishna's visions as hallucinations. Yet in the
secret chamber of his heart he bore a great love for the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was grateful to the Divine Mother for sending him one who doubted his
own realizations. Often he asked Narendra to test him as the money-changers test their
coins. He laughed at Narendra's biting criticism of his spiritual experiences and Samādhi.
When at times Narendra's sharp words distressed him, the Divine Mother Herself would
console him, saying: "Why do you listen to him? In a few days he will believe your every
word." He could hardly bear Narendra's absences. Often he would weep bitterly for the
sight of him. Sometimes Narendra would find the Master's love embarrassing; and one
day he sharply scolded him, warning him that such infatuation would soon draw him
down to the level of its object. The Master was distressed and prayed to the Divine
Mother. Then he said to Narendra: "You rogue, I won't listen to you any more. Mother
68says that I love you because I see God in you, and the day I no longer see God in you I
shall not be able to bear even the sight of you."
The Master wanted to train Narendra in the teachings of the non-dualistic Vedānta
philosophy. But Narendra, because of his Brāhmo upbringing, considered it wholly
blasphemous to look on man as one with his Creator. One day at the temple garden he
laughingly said to a friend: "How silly! This jug is God! This cup is God! Whatever we see
is God! And we too are God! Nothing could be more absurd." Sri Ramakrishna came out
of his room and gently touched him. Spellbound, he immediately perceived that
everything in the world was indeed God. A new universe opened around him. Returning
home in a dazed state, he found there too that the food, the plate, the eater himself, the
people around him, were all God. When he walked in the street, he saw that the cabs,
the horses, the streams of people, the buildings, were all Brahman. He could hardly go
about his day's business. His parents became anxious about him and thought him ill. And
when the intensity of the experience abated a little, he saw the world as a dream.
Walking in the public square, he would strike his head against the iron railings to know
whether they were real. It took him a number of days to recover his normal self. He had
a foretaste of the great experiences yet to come and realized that the words of the
Vedānta were true.
At the beginning of 1884 Narendra's father suddenly died of heart-failure, leaving the
family in a state of utmost poverty. There were six or seven mouths to feed at home.
Creditors were knocking at the door. Relatives who had accepted his father's unstinted
kindness now became enemies, some even bringing suit to deprive Narendra of his
ancestral home. Actually starving and barefoot, Narendra searched for a job, but without
success. He began to doubt whether anywhere in the world there was such a thing as
unselfish sympathy. Two rich women made evil proposals to him and promised to put an
end to his distress; but he refused them with contempt.
Narendra began to talk of his doubt of the very existence of God. His friends thought he
had become an atheist and piously circulated gossip adducing unmentionable motives for
his unbelief. His moral character was maligned. Even some of the Master's disciples
partly believed the gossip, and Narendra told these to their faces that only a coward
believed in God through fear of suffering or hell. But he was distressed to think that Sri
Ramakrishna, too, might believe these false reports. His pride revolted. He said to
himself: "What does it matter? If a man's good name rests on such slender foundations,
I don't care." But later on he was amazed to learn that the Master had never lost faith in
him. To a disciple who complained about Narendra's degradation, Sri Ramakrishna
replied: "Hush, you fool! The Mother has told me it can never be so. I won't look at you
if you speak that way again."
The moment came when Narendra's distress reached its climax. He had gone the whole
day without food. As he was returning home in the evening he could hardly lift his tired
limbs. He sat down in front of a house in sheer exhaustion, too weak even to think. His
mind began to wander. Then, suddenly, a divine power lifted the veil over his soul. He
found the solution of the problem of the coexistence of divine justice and misery, the
69presence of suffering in the creation of a blissful Providence. He felt bodily refreshed, his
soul was bathed in peace, and he slept serenely.
Narendra now realized that he had a spiritual mission to fulfil. He resolved to renounce
the world, as his grandfather had renounced it, and he came to Sri Ramakrishna for his
blessing. But even before he had opened his mouth, the Master knew what was in his
mind and wept bitterly at the thought of separation. "I know you cannot lead a worldly
life," he said, "but for my sake live in the world as long as I live."
One day, soon after, Narendra requested Sri Ramakrishna to pray to the Divine Mother
to remove his poverty. Sri Ramakrishna bade him pray to Her himself, for She would
certainly listen to his prayer. Narendra entered the shrine of Kāli. As he stood before the
image of the Mother, he beheld Her as a living Goddess, ready to give wisdom and
liberation. Unable to ask Her for petty worldly things, he prayed only for knowledge and
renunciation, love and liberation. The Master rebuked him for his failure to ask the
Divine Mother to remove his poverty and sent him back to the temple. But Narendra,
standing in Her presence, again forgot the purpose of his coming. Thrice he went to the
temple at the bidding of the Master, and thrice he returned, having forgotten in Her
presence why he had come. He was wondering about it when it suddenly flashed in his
mind that this was all the work of Sri Ramakrishna; so now he asked the Master himself
to remove his poverty, and was assured that his family would not lack simple food and
clothing.
This was a very rich and significant experience for Narendra. It taught him that Śakti,
the Divine Power, cannot be ignored in the world and that in the relative plane the need
of worshipping a Personal God is imperative. Sri Ramakrishna was overjoyed with the
conversion. The next day, sitting almost on Narendra's lap, he said to a devotee,
pointing first to himself, then to Narendra: "I see I am this, and again that. Really I feel
no difference. A stick floating in the Ganges seems to divide the water; but in reality the
water is one. Do you see my point? Well, whatever is, is the Mother - isn't that so?" In
later years Narendra would say: "Sri Ramakrishna was the only person who, from the
time he met me, believed in me uniformly throughout. Even my mother and brothers did
not. It was his unwavering trust and love for me that bound me to him for ever. He
alone knew how to love. Worldly people only make a show of love for selfish ends."
Tārak
Others destined to be monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna came to Dakshineśwar.
Tāraknāth Ghoshāl had felt from his boyhood the noble desire to realize God. Keshab
and the Brāhmo Samāj had attracted him but proved inadequate. In 1882 he first met
the Master at Rāmchandra's house and was astonished to hear him talk about Samādhi,
a subject which always fascinated his mind. And that evening he actually saw a
manifestation of that superconscious state in the Master. Tārak became a frequent
visitor at Dakshineśwar and received the Master's grace in abundance. The young boy
often felt ecstatic fervour in meditation. He also wept profusely while meditating on God.
Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "God favours those who can weep for Him. Tears shed for
God wash away the sins of former births."
70Bāburām
Bāburām Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar accompanied by Rākhāl, his classmate. The
Master, as was often his custom, examined the boy's physiognomy and was satisfied
about his latent spirituality. At the age of eight Bāburām had thought of leading a life of
renunciation, in the company of a monk, in a hut shut out from the public view by a
thick wall of trees. The very sight of the Panchavati awakened in his heart that dream of
boyhood. Bāburām was tender in body and soul. The Master used to say that he was
pure to his very bones. One day Hazra in his usual mischievous fashion advised Bāburām
and some of the other young boys to ask Sri Ramakrishna for some spiritual powers and
not waste their life in mere gaiety and merriment. The Master, scenting mischief, called
Bāburām to his side, and said: "What can you ask of me? Isn't everything that I have
already yours? Yes, everything I have earned in the shape of realizations is for the sake
of you all. So get rid of the idea of begging, which alienates by creating a distance.
Rather realize your kinship with me and gain the key to all the treasures."
Niranjan
Nitya Niranjan Sen was a disciple of heroic type. He came to the Master when he was
eighteen years old. He was a medium for a group of spiritualists. During his first visit the
Master said to him: "My boy, if you think always of ghosts you will become a ghost, and
if you think of God you will become God. Now, which do you prefer?" Niranjan severed
all connections with the spiritualists. During his second visit the Master embraced him
and said warmly: "Niranjan, my boy, the days are flitting away. When will you realize
God? This life will be in vain if you do not realize Him. When will You devote your mind
wholly to God?" Niranjan was surprised to see the Master's great anxiety for his spiritual
welfare. He was a young man endowed with unusual spiritual parts. He felt disdain for
worldly pleasures and was totally guileless, like a child. But he had a violent temper. One
day, as he was coming in a country boat to Dakshineśwar, some of his fellow passengers
began to speak ill of the Master. Finding his protest futile, Niranjan began to rock the
boat, threatening to sink it in midstream. That silenced the offenders. When he reported
the incident to the Master, he was rebuked for his inability to curb his anger.
Jogindra
Jogindranāth, on the other hand, was gentle to a fault. One day, under circumstances
very like those that had evoked Niranjan's anger, he curbed his temper and held his
peace instead of threatening Sri Ramakrishna's abusers. The Master, learning of his
conduct, scolded him roundly. Thus to each the fault of the other was recommended as a
virtue. The guru was striving to develop, in the first instance, composure, and in the
second, mettle. The secret of his training was to build up, by a tactful recognition of the
requirements of each given case, the character of the devotee.
Jogindranāth came of an aristocratic brāhmin family of Dakshineśwar. His father and
relatives shared the popular mistrust of Sri Ramakrishna's sanity. At a very early age the
boy developed religious tendencies, spending two or three hours daily in meditation, and
his meeting with Sri Ramakrishna deepened his desire for the realization of God. He had
a perfect horror of marriage. But at the earnest request of his mother he had had to
71yield, and he now believed that his spiritual future was doomed. So he kept himself away
from the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna employed a ruse to bring Jogindra to him. As soon as the disciple
entered the room, the Master rushed forward to meet the young man. Catching hold of
the disciple's hand, he said: "What if you have married, Haven't I too married? What is
there to be afraid of in that?" Touching his own chest he said: "If this [meaning himself]
is propitious, then even a hundred thousand marriages cannot injure you. It you desire
to lead a householder's life, then bring your wife here one day, and I shall see that she
becomes a real companion in your spiritual progress. But if you want to lead a monastic
life, then I shall eat up your attachment to the world." Jogin was dumbfounded at these
words. He received new strength, and his spirit of renunciation was re-established.
Śashi and Śarat
Śashi and Śarat were two cousins who came from a pious brāhmin family of Calcutta. At
an early age they had joined the Brāhmo Samāj and had come under the influence of
Keshab Sen. The Master said to them at their first meeting: "If bricks and tiles are burnt
after the trade-mark has been stamped on them, they retain the mark for ever.
Similarly, man should be stamped with God before entering the world. Then he will not
become attached to worldliness." Fully aware of the future course of their life, he asked
them not to marry. The Master asked Śashi whether he believed in God with form or in
God without form. Śashi replied that he was not even sure about the existence of God;
so he could not speak one way or the other. This frank answer very much pleased the
Master.
Śarat's soul longed for the all-embracing realization of the Godhead. When the Master
inquired whether there was any particular form of God he wished to see, the boy replied
that he would like to see God in all the living beings of the world. "But", the Master
demurred, "that is the last word in realization. One cannot have it at the very outset."
Śarat stated calmly: "I won't be satisfied with anything short of that. I shall trudge on
along the path till I attain that blessed state." Sri Ramakrishna was very much pleased.
Harināth
Harināth had led the austere life of a brahmachāri even from his early boyhood -bathing
in the Ganges every day, cooking his own meals, waking before sunrise, and reciting the
Gita from memory before leaving bed. He found in the Master the embodiment of the
Vedānta scriptures. Aspiring to be a follower of the ascetic Śankara, he cherished a great
hatred for women. One day he said to the Master that he could not allow even small girls
to come near him. The Master scolded him and said: "You are talking like a fool. Why
should you hate women? They are the manifestations of the Divine Mother. Regard them
as your own mother and you will never feel their evil influence. The more you hate them,
the more you will fall into their snares." Hari said later that these words completely
changed his attitude toward women.
The Master knew Hari's passion for Vedānta. But he did not wish any of his disciples to
become a dry ascetic or a mere bookworm. So he asked Hari to practise Vedānta in life
72by giving up the unreal and following the Real. "But it is not so easy", Sri Ramakrishna
said, "to realize the illusoriness of the world. Study alone does not help one very much.
The grace of God is required. Mere personal effort is futile. A man is a tiny creature after
all, with very limited powers. But he can achieve the impossible if he prays to God for
His grace." Whereupon the Master sang a song in praise of grace. Hari was profoundly
moved and shed tears. Later in life Hari achieved a wonderful synthesis of the ideals of
the Personal God and the Impersonal Truth.
Gangādhar
Gangādhar, Harināth's friend, also led the life of a strict brahmachari , eating vegetarian
food cooked by his own hands and devoting himself to the study of the scriptures. He
met the Master in 1884 and soon became a member of his inner circle. The Master
praised his ascetic habit and attributed it to the spiritual disciplines of his past life.
Gangādhar became a close companion of Narendra.
Hariprasanna
Hariprasanna, a college student, visited the Master in the company of his friends Śashi
and Śarat. Sri Ramakrishna showed him great favour by initiating him into spiritual life.
As long as he lived, Hariprasanna remembered and observed the following drastic advice
of the Master: "Even if a woman is pure as gold and rolls on the ground for love of God,
it is dangerous for a monk ever to look at her."
Kāli
Kāliprasād visited the Master toward the end of 1883. Given to the practice of meditation
and the study of the scriptures, Kāli was particularly interested in yoga. Feeling the need
of a guru in spiritual life, he came to the Master and was accepted as a disciple. The
young boy possessed a rational mind and often felt sceptical about the Personal God.
The Master said to him: "Your doubts will soon disappear. Others, too, have passed
through such a state of mind. Look at Naren. He now weeps at the names of Rādhā and
Krishna." Kāli began to see visions of gods and goddesses. Very soon these disappeared
and in meditation he experienced vastness, infinity, and the other attributes of the
Impersonal Brahman.
Subodh
Subodh visited the Master in 1885. At the very first meeting Sri Ramakrishna said to
him: "You will succeed. Mother says so. Those whom She sends here will certainly attain
spirituality." During the second meeting the Master wrote something on Subodh's
tongue, stroked his body from the navel to the throat, and said, "Awake, Mother!
Awake." He asked the boy to meditate. At once Subodh's latent spirituality was
awakened. He felt a current rushing along the spinal column to the brain. Joy filled his
soul.
Sāradā and Tulasi
Two more young men, Sāradā Prasanna and Tulasi, complete the small band of the
Master's disciples later to embrace the life of the wandering monk. With the exception of
the elder Gopāl, all of them were in their teens or slightly over. They came from middle-
73class Bengāli families, and most of them were students in school or college. Their
parents and relatives had envisaged for them bright worldly careers. They came to Sri
Ramakrishna with pure bodies, vigorous minds, and uncontaminated souls. All were born
with unusual spiritual attributes. Sri Ramakrishna accepted them, even at first sight, as
his children, relatives, friends, and companions. His magic touch unfolded them. And
later each according to his measure reflected the life of the Master, becoming a torch-
bearer of his message across land and sea.
Woman Devotees
With his woman devotees Sri Ramakrishna established a very sweet relationship. He
himself embodied the tender traits of a woman; he had dwelt on the highest plane of
Truth, where there is not even the slightest trace of sex; and his innate purity evoked
only the noblest emotion in men and women alike. His woman devotees often said: "We
seldom looked on Sri Ramakrishna as a member of the male sex. We regarded him as
one of us. We never felt any constraint before him, He was our best confidant." They
loved him as their child, their friend, and their teacher. In spiritual discipline he advised
them to renounce lust and greed and especially warned them not to fall into the snares
of men.
Gopāl Mā
Unsurpassed among the woman devotees of the Master in the richness of her devotion
and spiritual experiences was Aghoramani Devi, an orthodox brāhmin woman. Widowed
at an early age, she had dedicated herself completely to spiritual pursuits. Gopālā, the
Baby Krishna, was her Ideal Deity, whom she worshipped following the Vātsalya attitude
of the Vaishnava religion, regarding Him as her own child. Through Him she satisfied her
unassuaged maternal love, cooking for Him, feeding Him, bathing Him, and putting Him
to bed. This sweet intimacy with Gopālā won her the sobriquet of Gopāl Mā, or Gopālā's
Mother. For forty years she had lived on the bank of the Ganges in a small bare room,
her only companions being a threadbare copy of the Ramayana and a bag containing her
rosary. At the age of sixty, in 1884, she visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineśwar.
During the second visit, as soon as the Master saw her, he said: "Oh, you have come!
Give me something to eat." With great hesitation she gave him some ordinary sweets
that she had purchased for him on the way. The Master ate them with relish and asked
her to bring him simple curries or sweets prepared by her own hands. Gopāl Mā thought
him a queer kind of monk, for, instead of talking of God, he always asked for food. She
did not want to visit him again, but an irresistible attraction brought her back to the
temple garden. She carried with her some simple curries that she had cooked herself.
One early morning at three o'clock, about a year later, Gopāl Mā was about to finish her
daily devotions, when she was startled to find Sri Ramakrishna sitting on her left, with
his right hand clenched, like the hand of the image of Gopālā. She was amazed and
caught hold of the hand, whereupon the figure vanished and in its place appeared the
real Gopālā, her Ideal Deity. She cried aloud with joy. Gopālā begged her for butter. She
pleaded her poverty and gave Him some dry coconut candies. Gopālā sat on her lap,
snatched away her rosary, jumped on her shoulders, and moved all about the room. As
soon as the day broke she hastened to Dakshineśwar like an insane woman. Of course
74Gopālā accompanied her, resting His head on her shoulder. She clearly saw His tiny
ruddy feet hanging over her breast. She entered Sri Ramakrishna's room. The Master
had fallen into Samādhi. Like a child, he sat on her lap, and she began to feed him with
butter, cream, and other delicacies. After some time he regained consciousness and
returned to his bed. But the mind of Gopālā's Mother was still roaming in another plane.
She was steeped in bliss. She saw Gopālā frequently entering the Master's body and
again coming out of it. When she returned to her hut, still in a dazed condition, Gopālā
accompanied her.
She spent about two months in uninterrupted communion with God, the Baby Gopālā
never leaving her for a moment. Then the intensity of her vision was lessened; had it not
been, her body would have perished. The Master spoke highly of her exalted spiritual
condition and said that such vision of God was a rare thing for ordinary mortals. The fun-
loving Master one day confronted the critical Narendranāth with this simple-minded
woman. No two could have presented a more striking contrast. The Master knew of
Narendra's lofty contempt for all visions, and he asked the old lady to narrate her
experiences to Narendra. With great hesitation she told him her story. Now and then she
interrupted her maternal chatter to ask Narendra: "My son, I am a poor ignorant
woman. I don't understand anything. You are so learned. Now tell me if these visions of
Gopālā are true." As Narendra listened to the story he was profoundly moved. He said,
"Yes, mother, they are quite true." Behind his cynicism Narendra, too, possessed a heart
full of love and tenderness.
The March of Events
In 1882 Hriday was, dismissed from service in the Ka1i temple, for an act of indiscretion,
and was ordered by the authorities never again to enter the garden. In a way the hand
of the Divine Mother may be seen even in this. Having taken care of Sri Ramakrishna
during the stormy days of his spiritual discipline, Hriday had come naturally to consider
himself the sole guardian of his uncle. None could approach the Master without his
knowledge. And he would be extremely jealous if Sri Ramakrishna paid attention to
anyone else. Hriday's removal made it possible for the real devotees of the Master to
approach him freely and live with him in the temple garden.
During the week-ends the householders, enjoying a respite from their office duties,
visited the Master. The meetings on Sunday afternoons were of the nature of little
festivals. Refreshments were often served. Professional musicians now and then sang
devotional songs. The Master and the devotees sang and danced, Sri Ramakrishna
frequently going into ecstatic moods. The happy memory of such a Sunday would linger
long in the minds of the devotees. Those whom the Master wanted for special instruction
he would ask to visit him on Tuesdays and Saturdays. These days were particularly
auspicious for the worship of Kāli.
The young disciples destined to be monks, Sri Ramakrishna invited on week-days, when
the householders were not present. The training of the householders and of the future
monks had to proceed along entirely different lines. Since M. generally visited the Master
75on week-ends, the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna does not contain much mention of the
future monastic disciples.
Finally, there was a handful of fortunate disciples, householders as well as youngsters,
who were privileged to spend nights with the Master in his room. They would see him get
up early in the morning and walk up and down the room, singing in his sweet voice and
tenderly communing with the Mother.
Injury to the Master's Arm
One day, in January 1884, the Master was going toward the pine-grove when he went
into a trance. He was alone. There was no one to support him or guide his footsteps. He
fell to the ground and dislocated a bone in his left arm. This accident had a significant
influence on his mind, the natural inclination of which was to soar above the
consciousness of the body. The acute pain in the arm forced his mind to dwell on the
body and on the world outside. But he saw even in this a divine purpose; for, with his
mind compelled to dwell on the physical plane, he realized more than ever that he was
an instrument in the hand of the Divine Mother, who had a mission to fulfil through his
human body and mind. He also distinctly found that in the phenomenal world God
manifests Himself, in an inscrutable way, through diverse human beings, both good and
evil. Thus he would speak of God in the guise of the wicked, God in the guise of the
pious, God in the guise of the hypocrite, God in the guise of the lewd. He began to take
a special delight in watching the divine play in the relative world. Sometimes the sweet
human relationship with God would appear to him more appealing than the all-effacing
Knowledge of Brahman. Many a time he would pray: "Mother, don't make me
unconscious through the Knowledge of Brahman. Don't give me Brahmajnāna, Mother.
Am I not Your child, and naturally timid? I must have my Mother. A million salutations to
the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it to those who want it." Again he prayed: "O Mother,
let me remain in contact with men! Don't make me a dried-up ascetic. I want to enjoy
Your sport in the world." He was able to taste this very rich divine experience and enjoy
the love of God and the company of His devotees because his mind, on account of the
injury to his arm, was forced to come down to the consciousness of the body. Again, he
would make fun of people who proclaimed him as a Divine Incarnation, by pointing to his
broken arm. He would say, "Have you ever heard of God breaking His arm?" It took the
arm about five months to heal.
Beginning of His Illness
In April 1885 the Master's throat became inflamed. Prolonged conversation or absorption
in Samādhi, making the blood flow into the throat, would aggravate the pain. Yet when
the annual Vaishnava festival was celebrated at Pānihāti, Sri Ramakrishna attended it
against the doctor's advice. With a group of disciples he spent himself in music, dance,
and ecstasy. The illness took a turn for the worse and was diagnosed as "clergyman's
sore throat". The patient was cautioned against conversation and ecstasies. Though he
followed the physician's directions regarding medicine and diet, he could neither control
his trances nor withhold from seekers the solace of his advice. Sometimes, like a sulky
child, he would complain to the Mother about the crowds, who gave him no rest day or
night. He was overheard to say to Her: "Why do You bring here all these worthless
76people, who are like milk diluted with five times its own quantity of water? My eyes are
almost destroyed with blowing the fire to dry up the water. My health is gone. It is
beyond my strength. Do it Yourself, if You want it done. This (pointing to his own body)
is but a perforated drum, and if you go on beating it day in and day out, how long will it
last?"
But his large heart never turned anyone away. He said, "Let me be condemned to be
born over and over again, even in the form of a dog, if I can be of help to a single soul."
And he bore the pain, singing cheerfully, "Let the body be preoccupied with illness, but,
O mind, dwell for ever in God's Bliss!"
One night he had a haemorrhage of the throat. The doctor now diagnosed the illness as
cancer. Narendra was the first to break this heart-rending news to the disciples. Within
three days the Master was removed to Calcutta for better treatment. At Balarām's house
he remained a week until a suitable place could be found at Śyāmpukur, in the northern
section of Calcutta. During this week he dedicated himself practically without respite to
the instruction of those beloved devotees who had been unable to visit him oftener at
Dakshineśwar. Discourses incessantly flowed from his tongue, and he often went into
Samādhi. Dr. Mahendra Sarkār, the celebrated homeopath of Calcutta, was invited to
undertake his treatment.
Śyāmpukur
In the beginning of September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Śyāmpukur. Here
Narendra organized the young disciples to attend the Master day and night. At first they
concealed the Master's illness from their guardians; but when it became more serious
they remained with him almost constantly, sweeping aside the objections of their
relatives and devoting themselves whole-heartedly to the nursing of their beloved guru.
These young men, under the watchful eyes of the Master and the leadership of
Narendra, became the Antaranga Bhaktās, the devotees of Sri Ramakrishna's inner
circle. They were privileged to witness many manifestations of the Master's divine
powers. Narendra received instructions regarding the propagation of his message after
his death.
The Holy Mother - so Sāradā Devi had come to be affectionately known by Sri
Ramakrishna's devotees - was brought from Dakshineśwar to look after the general
cooking and to prepare the special diet of the patient. The dwelling space being
extremely limited, she had to adapt herself to cramped conditions. At three o'clock in the
morning she would finish her bath in the Ganges and then enter a small covered place
on the roof, where she spent the whole day cooking and praying. After eleven at night,
when the visitors went away, she would come down to her small bedroom on the first
floor to enjoy a few hours' sleep. Thus she spent three months, working hard, sleeping
little, and praying constantly for the Master's recovery.
At Śyāmpukur the devotees led an intense life. Their attendance on the Master was in
itself a form of spiritual discipline. His mind was constantly soaring to an exalted plane of
consciousness. Now and then they would catch the contagion of his spiritual fervour.
77They sought to divine the meaning of this illness of the Master, whom most of them had
accepted as an Incarnation of God. One group, headed by Girish with his robust
optimism and great power of imagination, believed that the illness was a mere pretext to
serve a deeper purpose. The Master had willed his illness in order to bring the devotees
together and promote solidarity among them. As soon as this purpose was served, he
would himself get rid of the disease. A second group thought that the Divine Mother, in
whose hand the Master was an instrument, had brought about this illness to serve Her
own mysterious ends. But the young rationalists, led by Narendra, refused to ascribe a
supernatural cause to a natural phenomenon. They believed that the Master's body, a
material thing, was subject, like all other material things, to physical laws. Growth,
development, decay, and death were laws of nature to which the Master's body could not
but respond. But though holding differing views, they all believed that it was to him
alone that they must look for the attainment of their spiritual goal.
In spite of the physician's efforts and the prayers and nursing of the devotees, the illness
rapidly progressed. The pain sometimes appeared to be unbearable. The Master lived
only on liquid food, and his frail body was becoming a mere skeleton. Yet his face always
radiated joy, and he continued to welcome the visitors pouring in to receive his blessing.
When certain zealous devotees tried to keep the visitors away, they were told by Girish,
"You cannot succeed in it; he has been born for this very purpose - to sacrifice himself
for the redemption of others."
The more the body was devastated by illness, the more it became the habitation of the
Divine Spirit. Through its transparency the gods and goddesses began to shine with ever
increasing luminosity. On the day of the Kāli Puja the devotees clearly saw in him the
manifestation of the Divine Mother.
It was noticed at this time that some of the devotees were making an unbridled display
of their emotions. A number of them, particularly among the householders, began to
cultivate, though at first unconsciously, the art of shedding tears, shaking the body,
contorting the face, and going into trances, attempting thereby to imitate the Master.
They began openly to declare Sri Ramakrishna a Divine Incarnation and to regard
themselves as his chosen people, who could neglect religious disciplines with impunity.
Narendra's penetrating eye soon sized up the situation. He found out that some of these
external manifestations were being carefully practised at home, while some were the
outcome of malnutrition, mental weakness, or nervous debility. He mercilessly exposed
the devotees who were pretending to have visions, and asked all to develop a healthy
religious spirit. Narendra sang inspiring songs for the younger devotees, read with them
the Imitation of Christ and the Gita, and held before them the positive ideals of
spirituality.
Last Days at Cossipore
When Sri Ramakrishna's illness showed signs of aggravation, the devotees, following the
advice of Dr. Sarkār, rented a spacious garden house at Cossipore, in the northern
suburbs of Calcutta. The Master was removed to this place on December 11, 1885.
78It was at Cossipore that the curtain fell on the varied activities of the Master's life on the
physical plane. His soul lingered in the body eight months more. It was the period of his
great Passion, a constant crucifixion of the body and the triumphant revelation of the
Soul. Here one sees the humanity and divinity of the Master passing and repassing
across a thin border line. Every minute of those eight months was suffused with touching
tenderness of heart and breath-taking elevation of spirit. Every word he uttered was full
of pathos and sublimity.
It took the group only a few days to become adjusted to the new environment. The Holy
Mother, assisted by Sri Ramakrishna's niece, Lakshmi Devi, and a few woman devotees,
took charge of the cooking for the Master and his attendants. Surendra willingly bore the
major portion of the expenses, other householders contributing according to their
means. Twelve disciples were constant attendants of the Master: Narendra, Rākhāl,
Bāburām, Niranjan, Jogin, Lātu, Tārak, the elder Gopāl, Kāli, Śashi, Śarat, and the
younger Gopāl. Sāradā, Harish, Hari, Gangādhar, and Tulasi visited the Master from time
to time and practised sādhana at home. Narendra, preparing for his law examination,
brought his books to the garden house in order to continue his studies during the
infrequent spare moments. He encouraged his brother disciples to intensify their
meditation, scriptural studies, and other spiritual disciplines. They all forgot their
relatives and their worldly duties.
Among the attendants Śashi was the embodiment of service. He did not practise
meditation, japa, or any of the other disciplines followed by his brother devotees. He was
convinced that service to the guru was the only religion for him. He forgot food and rest
and was ever ready at the Master's bedside.
Pundit Śaśadhar one day suggested to the Master that the latter could remove the illness
by concentrating his mind on the throat, the scriptures having declared that yogis had
power to cure themselves in that way. The Master rebuked the pundit. "For a scholar like
you to make such a proposal!" he said. "How can I withdraw the mind from the Lotus
Feet of God and turn it to this worthless cage of flesh and blood?" "For our sake at
least", begged Narendra and the other disciples. "But", replied Sri Ramakrishna, "do you
think I enjoy this suffering? I wish to recover, but that depends on the Mother."
NARENDRA:

least."
A few hours later the Master said to Narendra: "I said to Her: 'Mother, I cannot swallow
food because of my pain. Make it possible for me to eat a little.' She pointed you all out
to me and said: 'What? You are eating enough through all these mouths. Isn't that so?' I
was ashamed and could not utter another word." This dashed all the hopes of the
devotees for the Master's recovery.
79"I shall make the whole thing public before I go", the Master had said some time before.
On January 1, 1886, he felt better and came down to the garden for a little stroll. It was
about three o'clock in the afternoon. Some thirty lay disciples were in the hall or sitting
about under the trees. Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, "Well, Girish, what have you seen
in me, that you proclaim me before everybody as an Incarnation of God?" Girish was not
the man to be taken by surprise. He knelt before the Master and said with folded hands,
"What can an insignificant person like myself say about the One whose glory even sages
like Vyāsa and Vālmiki could not adequately measure?" The Master was profoundly
moved. He said: "What more shall I say? I bless you all. Be illumined!" He fell into a
spiritual mood. Hearing these words the devotees, one and all, became overwhelmed
with emotion. They rushed to him and fell at his feet. He touched them all, and each
received an appropriate benediction. Each of them, at the touch of the Master,
experienced ineffable bliss. Some laughed, some wept, some sat down to meditate,
some began to pray. Some saw light, some had visions of their Chosen Ideals, and some
felt within their bodies the rush of spiritual power.
Narendra, consumed with a terrific fever for realization, complained to the Master that all
the others had attained peace and that he alone was dissatisfied. The Master asked what
he wanted. Narendra begged for Samādhi, so that he might altogether forget the world
for three or four days at a time. "You are a fool", the Master rebuked him. "There is a
state even higher than that. Isn't it you who sing, 'All that exists art Thou'? First of all
settle your family affairs and then come to me. You will experience a state even higher
than Samādhi."
The Master did not hide the fact that he wished to make Narendra his spiritual heir.
Narendra was to continue the work after Sri Ramakrishna's passing. Sri Ramakrishna
said to him: "I leave these young men in your charge. See that they develop their
spirituality and do not return home." One day he asked the boys, in preparation for a
monastic life, to beg their food from door to door without thought of caste. They hailed
the Master's order and went out with begging-bowls. A few days later he gave the ochre
cloth of the sannyāsi to each of them, including Girish, who was now second to none in
his spirit of renunciation. Thus the Master himself laid the foundation of the future
Ramakrishna Order of monks.
Sri Ramakrishna was sinking day by day. His diet was reduced to a minimum and he
found it almost impossible to swallow. He whispered to M.: "I am bearing all this
cheerfully, for otherwise you would be weeping. If you all say that it is better that the
body should go rather than suffer this torture, I am willing." The next morning he said to
his depressed disciples seated near the bed: "Do you know what I see? I see that God
alone has become everything. Men and animals are only frameworks covered with skin,
and it is He who is moving through their heads and limbs. I see that it is God Himself
who has become the block, the executioner, and the victim for the sacrifice." He fainted
with emotion. Regaining partial consciousness, he said: "Now I have no pain. I am very
well." Looking at Lātu he said: "There sits Lātu resting his head on the palm of his hand.
To me it is the Lord who is seated in that posture."
80The words were tender and touching. Like a mother he caressed Narendra and Rākhāl,
gently stroking their faces. He said in a half whisper to M., "Had this body been allowed
to last a little longer, many more souls would have been illumined." He paused a
moment and then said: "But Mother has ordained otherwise. She will take me away lest,
finding me guileless and foolish, people should take advantage of me and persuade me
to bestow on them the rare gifts of spirituality." A few minutes later he touched his chest
and said: "Here are two beings. One is She and the other is Her devotee. It is the latter
who broke his arm, and it is he again who is now ill. Do you understand me?" After a
pause he added: "Alas! To whom shall I tell all this? Who will understand me?" "Pain", he
consoled them again, "is unavoidable as long as there is a body. The Lord takes on the
body for the sake of His devotees."
Yet one is not sure whether the Master's soul actually was tortured by this agonizing
disease. At least during his moments of spiritual exaltation - which became almost
constant during the closing days of his life on earth - he lost all consciousness of the
body, of illness and suffering. One of his attendants said later on: "While Sri
Ramakrishna lay sick he never actually suffered pain. He would often say: 'O mind!
Forget the body, forget the sickness, and remain merged in Bliss.' No, he did not really
suffer. At times, he would be in a state when the thrill of joy was clearly manifested in
his body. Even when he could not speak he would let us know in some way that there
was no suffering, and this fact was clearly evident to all who watched him. People who
did not understand him thought that his suffering was very great. What spiritual joy he
transmitted to us at that time! Could such a thing have been possible if he had been
suffering physically? It was during this period that he taught us again these truths.
'Brahman is always unattached. The three gunās are in It, but It is unaffected by them,
just as the wind carries odour yet remains odourless.' 'Brahman is Infinite Being, In
finite Wisdom, Infinite Bliss. In It there exist no delusion, no misery, no disease, no
death, no growth, no decay.' 'The Transcendental Being and the being within are one
and the same. There is one indivisible Absolute Existence.' "
The Holy Mother secretly went to a Śiva temple across the Ganges to intercede with the
Deity for the Master's recovery. In a revelation she was told to prepare herself for the
inevitable end.
One day when Narendra was on the ground floor, meditating, the Master was lying
awake in his bed upstairs. In the depths of his meditation Narendra felt as though a
lamp were burning at the back of his head. Suddenly he lost consciousness. It was the
yearned-for, all-effacing experience of nirvikalpa Samādhi, when the embodied soul
realizes its unity with the Absolute. After a very long time he regained partial
consciousness but was unable to find his body. He could see only his head. "Where is my
body?" he cried. The elder Gopāl entered the room and said, "Why, it is here, Naren!"
But Narendra could not find it. Gopāl, frightened, ran upstairs to the Master. Sri
Ramakrishna only said: "Let him stay that way for a time. He has worried me long
enough."
81After another long period Narendra regained full consciousness. Bathed in peace, he
went to the Master, who said: "Now the Mother has shown you everything. But this
revelation will remain under lock and key, and I shall keep the key. When you have
accomplished the Mother's work you will find the treasure again."
Some days later, Narendra being alone with the Master, Sri Ramakrishna looked at him
and went into Samādhi. Narendra felt the penetration of a subtle force and lost all outer
consciousness. Regaining presently the normal mood, he found the Master weeping.
Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "Today I have given you my all and I am now only a poor
fakir, possessing nothing. By this power you will do immense good in the world, and not
until it is accomplished will you return." Henceforth the Master lived in the disciple.
Doubt, however, dies hard. After one or two days Narendra said to himself, "If in the
midst of this racking physical pain he declares his Godhead, then only shall I accept him
as an Incarnation of God." He was alone by the bedside of the Master. It was a passing
thought, but the Master smiled. Gathering his remaining strength, he distinctly said, "He
who was Rāmā and Krishna is now, in this body, Ramakrishna - but not in your Vedāntic
sense." Narendra was stricken with shame.
Mahā–samādhi
Sunday, August 15, 1886. The Master's pulse became irregular. The devotees stood by
the bedside. Toward dusk Sri Ramakrishna had difficulty in breathing. A short time
afterwards he complained of hunger. A little liquid food was put into his mouth; some of
it he swallowed, and the rest ran over his chin. Two attendants began to fan him. All at
once he went into Samādhi of a rather unusual type. The body became stiff. Śaśi burst
into tears. But after midnight the Master revived. He was now very hungry and helped
himself to a bowl of porridge. He said he was strong again. He sat up against five or six
pillows, which were supported by the body of Śashi, who was fanning him. Narendra
took his feet on his lap and began to rub them. Again and again, the Master repeated to
him, "Take care of these boys." Then, he asked to lie down. Three times in ringing tones
he cried the name of Kāli, his life's Beloved, and lay back. At two minutes past one there
was a low sound in his throat and he fell a little to one side. A thrill passed over his
body. His hair stood on end. His eyes became fixed on the tip of his nose. His face was
lighted with a smile. The final ecstasy began. It was Mahā–samādhi, total absorption,
from which his mind never returned. Narendra, unable to bear it, ran downstairs.
Dr. Sarkār arrived the following noon and pronounced that life had departed not more
than half an hour before. At five o'clock the Master's body was brought downstairs, laid
on a cot, dressed in ochre clothes, and decorated with sandal-past and flowers. A
procession was formed. The passers-by wept as the body was taken to the cremation
ground at the Bārānagore Ghāt on the Ganges.
While the devotees were returning to the garden house, carrying the urn with the sacred
ashes, a calm resignation came to their souls and they cried, "Victory unto the Guru!"
82The Holy Mother was weeping in her room, not for her husband, but because she felt
that Mother Kāli had left her. As she was about to put off the marks of a Hindu widow, in
a moment of revelation she heard the words of faith "I have only passed from one room
to another."
