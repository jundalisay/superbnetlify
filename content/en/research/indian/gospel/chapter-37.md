Sunday, March 1, 1885

SRl RAMAKRISHNA was seated on the small couch in his room, absorbed in deep samādhi. Mahimacharan, Ram, Manomohan, Nabai Chaitanya, M., and other devotees
were sitting on a mat spread on the floor. They were watching the Master intently.

It was the day of the Dolayatra, a Hindu religious festival. Sri Krishna and Radha are the central figures of this celebration, their images being placed on a swing, which is rocked now and then. 

A red powder is showered on the images. Later, friends and relatives throw the powder at one another. This festival is celebrated when winter passes into
spring, on a full-moon day rendered doubly sacred by its association with the birth of Sri Chaitanya.

The devotees saw that the Master was returning to consciousness of the world, though his mind still lingered in the realm of God-vision.
The Master said to Mahimacharan, "My dear sir, please tell us something about love of God."

What need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love?

What is the use of penance if God is not worshipped with love?

What need is there of penance if God is seen within and without?

What is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without?

O Brahman! O my child! Cease from practising further penances.

Hasten to Sankara, the Ocean of Heavenly Wisdom;

Obtain from Him the love of God, the pure love praised by devotees,
which snaps in twain the shackles that bind you to the world.
Mahima said, "Once while the great sage Nārada was practising austerity, he suddenly
heard a heavenly voice repeating those lines."
Two kinds of devotion
MASTER; "There are two classes of devotees: jivakotis, or ordinary men, and
Isvarakotis, or Divine Messengers. The jivakoti's devotion to God is called vaidhi, formal;
that is, it conforms to scriptural laws. He worships God with a fixed number of articles,
repeats God's holy name a specified number of times, and so on and so forth. This kind
of devotion, like the path of knowledge, leads to the Knowledge of God and to samādhi.
The jivakoti does not return from samādhi to the relative plane.
"But the case of the Isvarakoti is different. He follows the process of 'negation' and
'affirmation'. First he negates the world, realizing that it is not Brahman; but then he
affirms the same world, seeing it as the manifestation of Brahman. To give an
illustration: a man wanting to climb to the roof first negates the stairs as not being the
775roof, but on reaching the roof he finds that the stairs are made of the same materials as
the roof: brick, lime, and brick-dust. Then he can either move up and down the stairs or
remain on the roof, as he pleases.
Vision of God
"Sukadeva was absorbed in samādhi-nirvikalpa samādhi, jada samādhi. Since Suka was
to recite the Bhagavata to King Parikshit, the Lord sent the sage Nārada to him.
Nārada saw him seated like an inert thing, absolutely unconscious of the world around
him. Thereupon Nārada sang four couplets on the beauty of Hari, to the accompaniment
of the vina. While the first couplet was being sung the hair on Suka's body stood on end.
Next he shed tears; for he saw the form of God, the Embodiment of Spirit, within
himself, in his heart. Thus Sukadeva saw the form of God even after jada samādhi. He
was an Isvarakoti.
How a liberated soul lives in the world
"Hanuman, after having the vision of God both with form and without, remained firmly
devoted to the form of Rāma, the Embodiment of Consciousness and Bliss.
"Prahlada sometimes realized, 'I am He'; sometimes he felt that he was the servant of
God. How can such a person live without love of God? That is why he must accept the
relationship of master and servant, feeling that God is the Master and himself the
servant. This enables him to enjoy the Bliss of Hari. In this attitude he feels that God is
the Bliss and he himself is the enjoyer.
"The 'ego of Devotion', the 'ego of Knowledge', and the 'ego of a child' do not harm the
devotee. Sankaracharya kept the ego of Knowledge'.
Detachment of a child
The 'ego of a child' is not attached to anything. The child is beyond the three Gunās ; he
is not under the control of any of them. One moment you find him angry; the next
moment it is all over. One moment you see him building his play house; the next
moment he forgets all about it. Now you see him love his playmates; but if they are out
of his sight a few days he forgets all about them. A child is not under the control of any
of the Gunās -sattva, rajas, or tamas.
"I-consciousness"after God-realization
"The bhakta feels, 'O God, Thou art the Lord and I am Thy devotee.' This 'I' is the 'ego of
bhakti'. Why does such a lover of God retain the 'ego of Devotion'? There is a reason.
The ego cannot begot rid of; so let the rascal remain as the servant of God, the devotee
of God.
"You may reason a thousand times, but you cannot get rid of the ego. The ego is like a
pitcher, and Brahman like the ocean-an infinite expanse of water on all sides. The
pitcher is set in this ocean. The water is both inside and out; the water is everywhere;
yet the pitcher remains. Now, this pitcher is the 'ego of the devotee'. As long as the ego
remains, 'you' and 'I' remain, and there also remains the feeling, 'O God, Thou art the
776Lord and I am Thy devotee; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.' You may reason
a million times, but you cannot get rid of it. But it is different if there is no pitcher."
Narendra entered the room and saluted the Master. They began to talk together.
Presently the Master came down from the couch and sat on the floor, on which a mat
had been spread. In the mean time the room had become filled with people, both
devotees and visitors.
Master warns Narendra about householders
MASTER (to Narendra): "Are you well? I hear that you often visit Girish Ghosh at his
house. Is it true?"
NARENDRA: "Yes, sir, I go there now and then."
Girish had been visiting Sri Ramakrishna for some months. The Master said that none
could fathom the depth of Girish's faith. And his longing for God was as intense as his
faith was deep. At home, he was always absorbed in the thought of Sri Ramakrishna.
Many of the Master's devotees visited him; they talked only about Sri Ramakrishna. But
Girish was a householder who had had varied experiences of worldly life, and the Master
knew that Narendra would renounce the world, that he would shun "woman and gold"
both mentally and outwardly.
MASTER: "Do you visit Girish frequently? No matter how much one washes a cup that
has contained a solution of garlic, still a trace of the smell will certainly linger. The
youngsters who come here are pure souls-untouched by 'woman and gold'. Men who
have associated a long time with 'woman and gold' smell of the garlic, as it were. They
are like a mango pecked by crows. Such a fruit cannot be offered to the Deity in the
temple, and you would hesitate to eat it yourself. Again, take the case of a new pot and
another in which curd has been made. One is afraid to keep milk in the second pot, for
the milk very often turns sour.
"Householder devotees like Girish form a class by themselves. They desire yoga and also
bhoga. Their attitude is that of Ravana, who wanted to enjoy the maidens of heaven
and at the same time realize Rāma. They are like the asuras, the demons, who enjoy
various pleasures and also realize Narayana."
NARENDRA: "But Girish has given up his old associates."
MASTER: "Yes, yes. He is like a bull castrated in old age. In Burdwan I once saw an ox
moving about the cows. I asked a bullock-cart driver: 'what is this? an ox? How strange!'
He said to me: 'True, sir. But it was castrated in old age, and so it hasn't altogether
shaken off the old tendencies.'
"In a certain place there sat some sannyāsis. A young woman happened to pass by. All
continued as before to meditate on God, except one of them, who cast sidelong glances
at her. Before becoming a monk he had been the father of three children.
777"If you make a solution of garlic in a cup, won't it be hard to remove the smell from it?
Can a worthless tree like the babui produce mangoes? Of course such a thing may
become possible through the occult powers of a yogi; but can everyone acquire such
powers?
Worldly people have no time for spiritual practice
"When have worldly people time to think of God? A man wanted to engage a pundit who
could explain the Bhagavata to him. His friend said: 'I know of an excellent pundit. But
there is one difficulty: he does a great deal of farming. He has four ploughs and eight
bullocks and is always busy with them; he has no leisure.' Thereupon the man said: 'I
don't care for a pundit who has no leisure. I am not looking for a Bhagavata scholar
burdened with ploughs and bullocks. I want a pundit who can really expound the sacred
book to me.'
"There was a king who used to listen daily to a pundit's exposition of the Bhagavata.
Every day at the end of their study the pundit would ask the king, 'O King, have you
understood what I have read?' To this question the king would daily give the same reply:
'Sir, you had better understand it first yourself.' Each day, when the pundit returned
home, he would ponder the meaning of the king's words. He was a pious man, devoted
to prayer and meditation. Gradually he came to his senses and realized that the only real
thing in the world is the Lotus Feet of God, and that all else is illusory. He felt dispassion
for the world and took up the life of a monk. As he was leaving the world he sent a man
to the king with the message: 'Yes, O King! Now I have understood.'
"But do I look down on worldly people? Of course not. When I see them, I apply the
Knowledge of Brahman, the Oneness of Existence. Brahman itself has become
everything; all are Narayana Himself. Regarding all women as so many forms of the
Divine Mother, I see no difference between a chaste woman and a streetwalker.
"Alas! I find no customers who want anything better than kalai pulse. No one wants to
give up 'woman and gold'. Man, deluded by the beauty of woman and the power of
money, forgets God. But to one who has seen the beauty of God, even the position of
Brahma, the Creator, seems insignificant.
"A man said to Ravana, 'You have been going to Sita in different disguises; why don't
you go to her in the form of Rāma?' 'But', Ravana replied 'when I meditate on Rāma in
my heart, the most beautiful women-celestial maidens like Rambha and Tilottama-
appear no better than ashes of the funeral pyre. Then even the position of Brahma
appears trivial to me, not to speak of the beauty of another man's wife.'
"Alas! I find that all the customers here seek worthless Kalai Pulse. Unless, the soul is
pure, it cannot have genuine love of God and single-minded devotion to the ideal. The
mind wanders away to various objects.
778(To Manomohan) "You may take offence at my words; but I said to Rākhāl, 'I would
rather hear that you had drowned yourself in the Ganges than learn that you had
accepted a job under another person and become his servant.'
"One day a Nepalese girl came here. She sang devotional songs to the accompaniment
of the esraj. When someone asked her if she was married, she said sharply: 'What? I am
the handmaid of God! Whom else could I serve?'
"How can a man living in the midst of 'woman and gold' realize God? It is very hard for
him to lead an unattached life. First, he is the slave of his wife, second, of money, and
third, of the master whom he serves.
Akbar and the holy man
"When Akbar was Emperor of Delhi there lived a hermit in a hut in the forest. Many
people visited the holy man. At one time he felt a great desire to entertain his visitors.
But how could he do so without money? So he decided to go to the Emperor for help, for
the gate of Akbar's palace was always open to holy men. The hermit entered the palace
while the Emperor was at his daily devotions and took a seat in a corner of the room. He
heard the Emperor conclude his worship with the prayer, 'O God, give me money; give
me riches', and so on and so forth. When the hermit heard this he was about to leave
the prayer hall; but the Emperor signed to him to wait. When the prayer was over, Akbar
said to him, 'You came to see me; how is it that you were about to leave without saying
anything to me?' 'Your Majesty need not trouble yourself about it', answered the hermit.
'I must leave now.' When the Emperor insisted, the hermit said, 'Many people visit my
hut, and so I came here to ask you for some money.' 'Then', said Akbar, 'why were you
going away without speaking to me?' The hermit replied: 'I found that you too were a
beggar; you too prayed to God for money and riches. Thereupon I said to myself, "Why
should I beg of a beggar? If I must beg, let me beg of God." ' "
NARENDRA: "Nowadays Girish Ghosh thinks of nothing but spiritual things."
MASTER: "That is very good. But why is he so abusive? Why does he use such vulgar
language to me? In my present state of mind I cannot bear such rudeness. When a
thunderbolt strikes near a house, the heavy things inside the house are not much
affected; but the window-panes rattle. Nowadays I cannot bear such roughness. A man
living on the plane of sattva cannot bear noise and uproar. That is why Hriday was sent
away. It was the Divine Mother who sent him away. During the later part of his stay he
went to extremes; he became very rough and abusive. (To Narendra) Do you agree with
Girish about me?"
NARENDRA: "He said he believed you to be an Incarnation of God. I didn't say anything
in answer to his remarks."
MASTER: "But how great his faith is! Don't you think so?"
779The devotees listened intently to the Master's words. He was still seated on the mat
spread on the floor, with M. by his side and Narendra in front of him. The devotees were
sitting around.
After a few minutes silence he said to Narendra tenderly, "My child, you will not attain
God without renouncing 'woman and gold'." As he said this, great emotion welled up in
his heart. Fixing on Narendra an earnest and tender look, he sang:
We are afraid to speak, and yet we are afraid to keep still;
Our minds, O Radha, half believe that we are about to lose
you!
We tell you the secret that we know-
The secret whereby we ourselves, and others, with our help,
Have passed through many a time of peril;
Now it all depends on you.
Sri Ramakrishna seemed to be afraid lest Narendra should leave him. Narendra looked at
the Master with tears in his eyes.
A visitor who was there for the first time heard and saw all this. He said to the Master,
"Sir, if one must renounce 'woman and gold', then what shall a householder do?"
MASTER: "You may enjoy 'woman and gold'. What has passed between us is no concern
of yours." Mahimacharan, a householder devotee, heard everything and sat speechless.
MASTER (to Mahima): "Go forward. Push on. You will discover the forest of sandal-wood.
Go farther and you will find the silver-mine. Go farther still and you will see the gold-
mine. Do not stop there. Go forward, and you will reach the mines of rubies and
diamonds. Therefore I say, go forward."
MAHIMA: "But, sir, something holds us back. We can't move."
MASTER (with a smile): "Why? Cut the reins. Cut them with the sword of God's name.
'The shackles of Kala, Time, are cut by Kāli's name.'
"Every now and then, the Master cast his gracious look on Narendra. He said, "Have you
now become an experienced physician?" Quoting a Sanskrit verse he said, "He who has
killed only a hundred patients is a novice in medicine; but he becomes an expert after
killing a thousand!"
Was the Master hinting that Narendra, even though still young, had had many painful
experiences of life? Narendra smiled and kept silent.
It was afternoon. The devotees were seated around the Master, listening to Nabai
Chaitanya's singing.
780Suddenly the Master left the room, but the music continued. M. accompanied the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna walked across the courtyard and entered the temple of Radhakanta. He
bowed down before the images, M. following him. There was some red powder in a tray.
The Master offered a little powder to the images and bowed down again. Next he
proceeded to the Kāli temple. Passing up the seven steps, he stood on the open porch
and looked at the image. Then he entered the shrine, offered red powder to the Divine
Mother, and saluted Her. As he left the temple he asked M., "Why didn't you Bring
Baburam with you?"
Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room accompanied by M. and another devotee carrying
the tray of red powder. He offered a little of it to all the pictures of gods and goddesses
in his room, but not to those of Jesus Christ and himself. Then he threw the powder on
the bodies of Narendra and the other devotees. They all took the dust of his feet.
In the cool shade of the late afternoon the devotees walked about in the temple garden,
leaving the Master and M. in the room. The Master whispered to M.: "All say that they
meditate well. But why is it different with Paltu? What do you think of Narendra? He is
utterly guileless. Just now he is faced with many difficult family problems and so his
spiritual progress is a little checked; but it will not be so for long."
Narendra was arguing on the verandah with a Vedantist. Now and then the Master went
out to look at them. As the devotees gathered in the room he asked Mahima to recite a
hymn. Mahima chanted a verse from the Mahanirvana Tantra:
We worship the Brahman-Consciousness in the Lotus of the
Heart,
The Undifferentiated, who is adored by Hari, Hara, and
Brahma. . . .
Mahima recited a few more hymns and at last one to Śiva, by Sankaracharya, that
compared the world to a deep well and a wilderness. Mahima was a householder.
The hymn ran thus:
O Great God! O Thou Auspicious One, with the moon shining in Thy
crest!
Slayer of Madana! Wielder of the trident! Unmoving One! Lord of the
Himalayas!
O Consort of Durga, Lord of all creatures! Thou who scatterest the
distress of the fearful!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
O Beloved of Parvati's heart! O Thou moon-crested Deity!
Master of every being! Lord of hosts! O Thou, the Lord of Parvati!
O Vamadeva, Self-existent One! O Rudra, Wielder of the bow!
781Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
O blue-throated God! Śiva, whose ensign is the bull! O Five-faced
One!
Lord of the worlds, who wearest snakes upon Thy wrists! O Thou
Auspicious One!
O Śiva! O Pasupati! O Thou, the Lord of Parvati!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest Of this miserable
world.
O Lord of the Universe! O Śiva Sankara! OGod of Gods!
Thou who dost bear the river Ganges in Thy matted locks!
Thou, the Master of Pramatha and Nandika! O Hara, Lord of the
world!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
O King of Kasi, Lord of the cremation ground of Manikarnika!
O mighty Hero, Thou the Destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice! O All-
pervasive One!
O Lord of hosts! Omniscient One, who art the sole Indweller in every
heart! O Lord!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
O Great God! Compassionate One! O Benign Deity!
O Byomakesa! Blue-throated One! O Lord of hosts!
Thy body is smeared with ashes! Thou art garlanded with human
skulls!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
O Thou who dwellest on Mount Kailas! Thou whose carrier is thebull!
O Conqueror of death! O Three-eyed One! Lord of the three worlds!
Beloved of Narayana! Conqueror of lust! Thou, Śakti's Lord!
Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
Lord of the Universe! Refuge of the whole world! O Thou of infinite
forms!
Soul of the Universe! O Thou in whom repose the infinite virtues of the
world!
O Thou adored by all! Compassionate One! O Friend of the poor!
782Rescue me, helpless as I am, from the trackless forest of this miserable
world.
MASTER (to Mahima): "Why do you call the world a deep well or a trackless forest? An
aspirant may think so in the beginning; but how can he be frightened by the world if he
holds fast to God? Then he finds that-
This very world is a mansion of mirth;
Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.
"Why should you be frightened? Hold fast to God. What if the world is like a forest of
thorns? Put on shoes and walk on the thorns. Whom should you fear? You won't have to
play again the part of the 'thief' in the game of hide-and-seek, once you touch the
granny'.
"King Janaka used to fence with two swords-the one of Knowledge and the other of
action. Nothing can frighten an expert player. (To M.) "My mind is still drawn to what he
just recited."
Sri Ramakrishna referred to the hymns chanted by Mahima.
Nabai Chaitanya and the other devotees began to sing. They were joined by the Master,
who danced, drunk with divine love. Afterwards he said: "This is the one thing needful,
the chanting of God's name. All else is unreal. Love and devotion alone are real, and
other things are of no consequence."
Later Sri Ramakrishna went out in the direction of the Panchavati. He asked M. about
Binode, a student in M.'s school, who now and then experienced ecstasy while thinking
of God. The Master loved him dearly. As he was returning to his room with M., he asked:
"Well, some speak of me as an Incarnation of God. What do you think about it?" The
Master came back to his room and sat on the small couch. He repeated the question to
M. The other devotees were seated at a distance and could not follow the conversation.
MASTER: "What do you say?"
M: "I think so too. You are like Sri Chaitanya."
MASTER: "Is it a full manifestation of God, or a part? Tell me how much.'
M: "I don't know, sir. But it is true that there is in you an Incarnation of the Divine
Power. There is no doubt that God alone dwells in you."
MASTER: "That is true. Chaitanya also wanted to realize Śakti, the Divine Power."
Narendra was engaged in a heated discussion. Ram, who had recently recovered from,
an illness, joined him.
783MASTER (to M.): "I don't like such discussions. (To Ram) Will you stop that? You haven't
been well. All right, go on softly; don't get so excited. (To M.) I don't like these
discussions. I used to weep and pray to the Divine Mother saying: 'O Mother, any man
says it is this, while another says it is that. Do Thou tell me, O Mother, what is the
truth.'"
Saturday, March. 7, 1885
At three o'clack in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was in his room at Dakshineswar
conversing happily with his devotees. Baburam, the younger Naren, Paltu, Haripada,
Mohinimohan, and others were present. A young brahmin who had been staying with the
Master a few days was also there.The Holy Mother, Sri Ramakrishna's wife, was living in
the nahabat. Occasianally she would come to Sri Ramakrishna's room to attend to his
needs. Mohinimohan had braught his wife and Nabin's mother with him to the temple
garden from Calcutta. The ladies were with the Holy Mother; they were waiting far an
opportunity to visit the Master when the men devotees would leave the room.
Master talks about his young disciples
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. As he looked at the young devotees his
face beamed with joy.
Rākhāl was not then liying at Dakshineswar with the Master. Since his return from
Vrindāvan he had been living at home.
MASTER (smjling): "Rākhāl is now enjoying his 'pension'. Since his return from
Vrindāvan he has been staying at home. His wife is there. But he said to me that he
would not accept any work even if he were offered a salary of a thousand rupees.
"Rākhāl would lie down here and say to me that he didn't care even for my campany. He
was then passing through such an exalted state.
"Bhavanāth is married; but he spends the whole night in spiritual conversation with his
wife. The couple passes their time talking of God alone: I said to him, 'Have a little fun
with your wife now and then.' 'What?' he retorted angrily. 'Shall we too indulge in
frivolity?' "
Sri Ramakrishna began to talk about Narendra.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I haven't felt the same strong longing for the younger Naren
that I felt for Narendra.
(To Haripada) "Do you go to Girish Ghosh's house?"
HARIPADA: "Yes, I go there very often. He is our neighbour."
MASTER: "Does Narendra, too, go there?"
HARIPADA: "Yes, I see him there occasionally."
784MASTER: "What does he say in reply to Girish?" [Girish Ghosh spoke of Sri Ramakrishna
as an Incarnation of God.]
HARIPADA: "Narendra has been defeated in the argument."
MASTER: "No, Narendra says, 'Girish Ghosh has such strong faith; why should I
contradict him?' "
The brother of Judge Anukal Mukhopadhyaya's son-in-law was in the room. The Master
asked him, "Do you know Narendra?"
BROTHER: "Yes, sir. He is a very intelligent young man."
MASTER (to the devotees): "He must be a good man because he speaks highly of
Narendra. Narendra was here the other day and sang with Trailokya Sannyal. But that
day his singing seemed flat to me."
Baburam was a student in the Entrance Class in the school where M. taught.
MASTER (to Baburam): "Where are your books? Aren't you attending to your studies?
(To M.) He wants to stick to both.
"That is very difficult. What will you gain by knowing God partially? Vasishthadeva, great
sage that he was, was overcome at the death of his sons. That amazed Lakshmana and
he asked Rāma the reason. Rāma said: 'Brother, what is there to wonder at? He who has
knowledge has ignorance also. Brother, go beyond both knowledge and ignorance.' If a
thorn enters the sole of your foot, you get anothet thorn to take out the first one.
Afterwards you throw both away. Likewise, one procures the thorn of knowledge to
remove the thorn of ignorance; then one goes beyond both knowledge and ignorance."
BABURAM (smiling): "That's what I want."
MASTER (smiling): "But, my child, can you attain it by holding to both? If you want that,
then come away."
BABURAM (smiling): "Take me away from the world."
MASTER (to M.): "Rākhāl lived with me, but that was different; his father agreed to it. If
these boys stay here there will be trouble.
(To Baburam) "You have no strength of mind; you haven't much courage. Just see how
the younger Naren says, 'I will come away for good."
Sri Ramakrishna came down from the small couch and sat among the youngsters on the
floor. M. sat by his side.
785Master's eagerness for a spiritual companion
MASTER (to M.): "I have been seeking one who has totally renounced woman and gold.
When I find a young man, I think that perhaps he will live with me; but everyone raises
some objection or other.
"A ghost sought a companion. It is said that a man who dies on a Saturday or Tuesday
becomes a ghost. Therefore, whenever the ghost saw anybody fall from a roof or
stumble and faint on the road on either of those days, he would run to him, hoping that
the man, through an accidental death, would become a ghost and be his companion. But
such was his ill luck that everyone revived. The poor thing could not get a companion.
"Just see, Rākhāl always gives his wife as an excuse. He says, 'What will become of her?'
When I touched Narendra on the chest, he became unconscious; then he cried out: 'Oh,
what have you done to me? Don't you know that I have a father and mother?'
"Why has God made me lead this kind of life? Chaitanyadeva became a sannyāsi so that
all would salute him. Whoever salutes an Incarnation, even once, obtains liberation."
Mohinimohan had brought a basket of sweetmeats for Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER: "Who has brought these sweets?”
Baburam pointed to Mohinimohan.
Sri Ramakrishna touched the sweets, uttering the word "Om", and ate a little. Then he
distributed them among the devotees. To the surprise of the others, he fed the younger
Naren and a few of the boys with his own hand.
MASTER (to M): "This has a meaning. There is a greater manifestation of God in men of
pure heart. In former years, when I used to go to Kamarpukur, I would feed some of the
young boys with my own hand. Chine Sankhari would say, 'Why doesn't he feed us that
way?' But how could I? They led an immoral life. Who would feed them?"
Sri Ramakrishna was in the happiest mood with his young and pure-souled devotees. He
was seated on the small couch and was doing funny imitations of a kirtani. The devotees
laughed heartily. The kirtani is dressed lavishly and covered with ornaments. She sings
standing on the floor, a coloured kerchief in her hand. Now and then she coughs to draw
people's attention and blows her nose, raising her nose-ring. When a respectable
gentleman enters the room she welcomes him with appropriate words, still continuing
her song. Now and then she pulls her sari from her arms to show off her jewels.
The devotees were convulsed, with laughter at this mimicry by Sri Ramakrishna. Paltu
rolled on the ground. Pointing to him, the Master said to M.: "Look at that child! He is
rolling with laughter." He said to Paltu with a smile: "Don't report this to your father, or
he will lose the little respect he has for me. You see, he is an 'Englishman."
False piety
MASTER (to the devotees): "There are people who indulge in all kinds of gossip at the
time of their daily devotions. As you know, one is not permitted to talk then; so they
786make all kinds of signs, keeping their lips closed. In order to say, 'Bring this', 'Bring
that', they make sounds like 'Huh', 'Uhuh'. All such things they do! (Laughter.)
"Again, there are some who bargain for fish while telling their beads. As they count the
rosary, with a finger they point out the fish, indicating, That one, please.' They reserve
all their business for that time! (Laughter.)
"There are women who come to the Ganges for their bath and, instead of thinking of
God, gossip about no end of things. 'What jewels did you offer at the time of your son's
marriage?'- 'Has so-and-so returned from her father-in law's house?' - 'So-and-so is
seriously ill.' - 'So-and-so went to see the bride; we hope that they will offer a
magnificent dowry and that there will be a great feast.' - 'Harish always nags at me; he
can't stay away from me even an hour.' - 'My child, I couldn't come to see you all these
days; I was so busy with the betrothal of so-and-so's daughter.'
"You see, they have come to bathe in the holy river, and yet they indulge in all sorts of
worldly talk."
The Master began to look intently at the younger Naren and went into samādhi. Did he
see God Himself in the pure-souled devotee?
The devotees silently watched the figure of Sri Ramakrishna motionless in samādhi. A
few minutes before there had been so much laughter in the room; now there was deep
silence, as if no one were there. The Master sat with folded hands as in his photograph.
After a short while his mind began to come down to the relative plane. He heaved a long
sigh and became aware of the outer world. He looked at the devotees and began to talk
with them of their spiritual progress.
MASTER (to the younger Naren): "I have been eager to see you. You will succeed. Come
here once in a while. Well, which do you prefer-jnāna or bhakti?"
THE YOUNGER NAREN: "Pure bhakti."
MASTER: "But how can you love someone unless you know him? (Pointing to M, with a
smile) How can you love him unless you know him? (To M.) Since a pure-souled person
has asked for pure bhakti, it must have some meaning.
Genuine bhakti
"One does not seek bhakti of one's own accord without inborn tendencies. This is the
characteristic of prema-bhakti. There is another kind of bhakti, called jnāna-bhakti,
which is love of God based on reasoning.
(To the younger Naren) "Let me look at your body; take off your shirt. Fairly broad
chest. You will succeed. Come here now and then."
787Sri Ramakrishna was still in the ecstatic mood. He spoke tenderly to the other devotees
about their future.
MASTER (to Paltu): "You will succeed, too, but, it will take a little time.
(To Baburam) "Why don't I attract you to me? It is just to avoid trouble.
(To Mohinimohan) "As for you you are all right. There is a little yet to be done. When
that is achieved, nothing will remain-neither duty nor work nor the world itself. Is it good
to get rid of everything?"
As Sri Ramakrishna spoke these words he looked at Mohini affectionately, as if scanning
his inmost feelings. Was Mohini really wondering whether it would, be wise to renounce
all for God? After a while Sri Ramakrishna said, "God binds the Bhagavata pundit to the
world with one tie; otherwise, who would remain to explain the sacred book? He keeps
the pundit bound for the good of men. That is why the Divine Mother has kept you in the
world."
Now Sri Ramakrishna spoke to the young brahmin.
MASTER: "Give up knowledge and reasoning; accept bhakti. Bhakti alone is the essence.
Is this the third day of your stay here?"
BRAHMIN (with folded hands): "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Have faith. Depend on God. Then you will not have to do anything yourself.
Mother Kāli will do everything for you.
"Jnāna goes as far as the outer court, but bhakti can enter the inner court. The Pure Self
is unattached. Both vidyā and avidyā are in It, but It is unattached. Sometimes there is
a good and sometimes a bad smell in the air, but the air itself is unaffected.
Nature of Ātman
"Once Vyasadeva was about to cross the Jamuna. The gopis also were there. They
wanted to go to the other side of the river to sell curd, milk, and cream. But there was
no ferry at that time. They were all worried about how to cross the river, when Vyāsa
said to them, 'I am very hungry.' The milkmaids fed him with milk and cream. He
finished almost all their food. Then Vyāsa said to the river, 'O Jamuna, if I have not
eaten anything, then your waters will part and we shall walk through.' It so happened.
The river parted and a pathway was formed between the waters. Following that path, the
gopis and Vyāsa crossed the river. Vyāsa had said, 'If I have not eaten anything'. That
means, the real man is Pure Ātman. Ātman is unattached and beyond Prakriti. It has
neither hunger nor thirst; It knows neither birth nor death; It does not age, nor does It
die. It is immutable as Mount Sumeru.
788Jeevanmukta & Separation of body and soul
"He who has attained this Knowledge of Brahman is a jivanmukta, liberated while living
in the body. He rightly understand that the Ātman and the body are two separate things.
After realizing God one does not identify the Ātman with the body. These two are
separate, like the kernel and the shell of the coconut when its milk dries up. The Ātman
moves, as it were, within the body. When the 'milk' of worldly-mindedness has dried up,
one gets Self-knowledge. Then one feels that Ātman and body are two separate things.
The kernel of a green almond or betel-nut cannot be separated from the shell; but when
they are ripe the juice dries up and the kernel separates from the shell. After the
attainment of the Knowledge of Brahman, the 'milk' of worldly-mindedness dries up.
"But it is extremely difficult to attain the Knowledge of Brahman. One doesn't get it by
merely talking about it. Some people feign it. (Smiling) There was a man who was a
great liar; but, on the other hand, he used to say he had the Knowledge of Brahman.
When someone took him to task for telling lies, he said: 'Why, this world is truly like a
dream. If everything is unreal, then can truth itself be real? Truth is as unreal as
falsehood.'" (All laugh.)
Sri Ramakrishna sat with the devotees on the mat on the floor. He was smiling. He said
to the devotees, "Please stroke my feet gently." They carried out his request. He said to
M., "There is great significance in this." Placing his hand on his heart, the Master said, "If
there is anything here, then through this service the ignorance and illusion of the
devotees will be completely destroyed."
Suddenly Sri Ramakrishna became serious, as if about to reveal a secret.
Revelation about himself
MASTER (to M.): "There is no outsider here. The other day, when Harish was with me, I
saw Satchidananda come out of this sheath, It said, 'I incarnate Myself in every age.' I
thought that I myself was saying these words out of mere fancy. I kept quiet and
watched. Again Satchidananda Itself spoke, saying, 'Chaitanya, too, worshipped Śakti.' "
The devotees listened to these words in amazement. Some wondered whether God
Himself was seated before them in the form of Sri Ramakrishna. The Master paused a
moment. Then he said, addressing M., "I saw that it is the fullest manifestation of
Satchidananda; but this time the Divine Power is manifested through the glory of
sattva."
The devotees sat spellbound.
MASTER (to M.): "Just now I was saying to the Mother, 'I cannot talk much.' I also said
to Her, 'May people's inner consciousness be awakened by only one touch!' You see,
such is the power of Yogamaya that She can cast a spell. She did so at Vrindāvan. That
is why Subol was able to unite Sri Krishna and Radhika. Yogamaya, the Primal Power,
has a power of attraction. I applied that power myself.
(To M.) "Well, do you think that those who come here are realizing anything?"
789M: "Yes, sir, it must be so."
MASTER: "How do you know?"
M. (smiling): "Everyone says, 'Whoever goes to him doesn't return to the world.'
MASTER (smiling): "A bullfrog was caught by a water-snake. The snake could neither
swallow the frog nor let it go. As a result the frog suffered very much; he croaked
continuously. And the snake suffered too. But if the frog had been seized by a cobra, he
would have been quiet after one or two croaks. (All laugh.)
(To the young devotees) "Read the Bhaktichaitanya- chandrika by Trailokya. Ask
Trailokya for a copy. He has written well about Chaitanyadeva."
A DEVOTEE: "Will he give it to us?"
MASTER (smiling): "Why not? If a farmer has a good crop of melons he can easily give
away two or three. (All laugh.) Won't Trailokya give you the book free?
(To Paltu) "Come here now and then."
PALTU: "I shall come whenever I can."
MASTER: "Will you see me in Calcutta when I go there?"
PALTU: "Yes, I shall try."
MASTER; "That's the answer of a calculating mind."
PALTU: "If I don't say, 'I shall try', I may be a liar."
MASTER (to M.): "I don't mind the lies of these boys. They are not free.
(To Haripada) "Why hasn't Mahendra Mukherji come here lately?"
HARlPADA: "I'm not quite sure why."
M. (smiling): "He's practising jnanayoga!"
MASTER: "No, it's not that. The other day he promised to send me in his carriage to the
theatre to see a play about the life of Prahlada; but he didn't send the carriage. Perhaps
that is why he doesn't come."
M: "One day I saw Mahima Chakravarty and had a talk with him. It seems that
Mahendra visits him."
790MASTER: "But Mahima talks about bhakti also. He loves to recite the hymn: 'what need
is there of penance if God is worshipped with love?' "
M. (smiling): "He says that because you make him say it."
About Girish
Girish Chandra Ghosh was always talking to the devotees about the Master.
HARIPADA: "Girish Ghosh sees many visions nowadays. After going home from here he
remains absorbed in spiritual moods and sees many things."
MASTER: 'That may be true. Coming to the Ganges, one sees many things-boats, ships,
and what not."
HARIPADA: "Girish Ghosh says: 'From now on I shall occupy myself only with my work.
In the morning, on the stroke of the clock, I shall sit down with my pen and ink-pot and
write for the whole day.' He makes the resolve, no doubt, but cannot carry it out. No
sooner do we visit him than he begins to talk about you. You asked him to send
Narendra here in a carriage. He said, 'I shall hire a carriage for Narendra.' "
At five o'clock the younger Naren was ready to go home. Sri Ramakrishna stood by his
side on the northeast verandah and gave him various instructions. Then the boy saluted
the Master and departed. Many of the devotees also took their leave.
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch talking to Mohini. Mohini's wife was
almost mad with grief on account of her son's death. Sometimes she laughed and
sometimes she wept. But she felt peaceful in Sri Ramakrishna's presence.
MASTER: "How is your wife now?"
MOHINI: "She becomes quiet whenever she is here; but sometimes at home she
becomes very wild. The other day she was going to kill herself."
When Sri Ramakrishna heard this he appeared worried. Mohini said to him humbly,
"Please give her a few words of advice."
MASTER: "Don't allow her to cook. That will heat her brain all the more. And keep her in
the company of others so that they may watch her."
It was dusk. Preparations were going on in the temples for the evening worship. The
lamp was lighted in the Master's room and incense was burnt. Seated on the small
couch, Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother and chanted Her name in a tender
voice. There was nobody in the room except M, who was sitting on the floor.
Sri Ramakrishna rose from the couch. M also stood up. The Master asked him to shut the
west and north doors of the room. M obeyed and stood by Sri Ramakrishna on the porch.
791The Master said that he wanted to go to the Kāli temple. Leaning on M.'s arm, he came
down to the terrace of the temple. He asked M. to call Baburam and sat down.
After visiting the Divine Mother, the Master returned to his room across the court,
chanting, "O Mother! Mother! Rajarajesvari!"
Sri Ramakrishna entered his room and sat on the small couch. He had been passing
through an extraordinary state of mind: he could not touch any metal. He had said a few
days before, "It seems that the Divine Mother has been removing from my mind all ideas
of possession." He had been eating from plantain-leaves and drinking water from an
earthen tumbler. He could not touch a metal jar; so he had asked the devotees to get a
few earthen jars for him. If he touched metal plates or pots, his hand ached as if stung
by a horned fish.
Prasanna had brought a few earthen pots, but they were very small. The Master said
with a smile: These pots are too small. But he is a nice boy. Once I asked him to take off
his clothes, and he stood naked in front of me. What a child he is!"
Tārak of Belgharia arrived with a friend and bowed low before Sri Ramakrishna, who was
sitting on the small couch. The room was lighted by an oil lamp. A few devotees were
sitting on the floor.
Tārak was about twenty years old, and married. His parents did not allow him to come to
Sri Ramakrishna. He lived mostly at his home near Bowbazar. The Master was very fond
of him. Tārak's friend had a tamasic nature; he rather scoffed at the Master and religious
ideas in general.
MASTER (to Tārak's friend): "Why don't you go and visit the temples?"
FRIEND: "Oh, I've seen them before."
MASTER: "Is it wrong for Tārak to come here?"
FRIEND: "You know best."
MASTER (pointing to M.): "He is a headmaster."
FRIEND: "Oh!"
Master warns Tārak
Sri Ramakrishna asked about Tatak's health and talked with him at length. Tārak was
ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to be careful about many things.
MASTER: "My good man, beware. Beware of 'woman and gold'. Once you sink in the
māyā of a woman, you will not be able to rise. It is the whirlpool of the Viśālākśi. He who
has fallen into it cannot pull himself out again. Come here now and then."
792TĀRAK: "My people at home don't let me."
A DEVOTEE: "Suppose someone's mother says to him, 'Don't go to Dakshineswar.'
Suppose she curses him, saying, 'If you go there you will be drinking my blood!'"
MASTER: "A mother who says that is no mother; she is the embodiment of avidyā. There
is no sin in disobeying such a mother. She obstructs her son's path to God. There is no
harm in disobeying your elders for the sake of God. For Rāma's sake Bharat did not obey
his mother Kaikeyi. The gopis did not obey their husbands when they were forbidden to
visit Krishna. Prahlada disobeyed his father for God. Vali disregarded the words of
Sukracharya, his teacher, in order to please God. Bibhishana went against the wishes of
Ravana, his elder brother, to please Rāma. But you must obey your elders in all other
things. Let me see your hand."
Sri Ramakrishna took Tārak's hand into his own and seemed to feel its weight. A few
moments later he said: "There is a little crookedness in your mind; but that will go. Pray
to God a little and come here now and then. Yes, that twist will go. Is it you that have
hired the house at Bowbazar?"
TĀRAK: "Not I, sir, but my parents."
MASTER (smiling): "They or you? Is it because you are afraid of the 'tiger'?" Tārak had a
young wife. Did the Master mean that a woman is like a tiger to a man?
Tārak saluted Sri Ramakrishna and took his leave. The Master lay down on the small
couch. He seemed worried about Tārak. Suddenly he said to M., "Why do I worry so
much about these young boys?" M. kept still. He was thinking over a reply. The Master
asked him, "Why don't you speak?"
Mohini's wife entered the room and sat at one side. Sri Ramakrishna spoke to M. about
Tārak's friend.
MASTER: "Why did Tārak bring that fellow with him?"
M: "Perhaps he wanted a companion for the road. It is a long way from Calcutta; so he
brought a friend with him."
The Master suddenly addressed Mohini's wife and said: "By unnatural death one
becomes an evil spirit. Beware. Make it clear to your mind. Is this what you have come
to after hearing and seeing so much?" Mohini was about to take his leave. He saluted
Sri Ramakrishna. His wife also saluted the Master, who stood near the north door of the
room. Mohini's wife spoke to him in a whisper.
MASTER: "Do you want to stay here?"
MOHINI'S WIFE: "Yes, I want to spend a few days with the Holy Mother at the Nahabat.
May I?"
793MASTER: "That will be all right. But you talk of dying. That frightens me. And the Ganges
is so near!"
