Chapter 27
AT DAKSHINESWAR
Sunday, September 7, 1884
IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar.
He had not yet taken his midday meal.
Arrangements had been made with the musician Shyamdas to entertain the Master and
the devotees with his kirtan. Baburam, M., Manomohan, Bhavanath, Kishori, Chunilal,
Haripada, the Mukherji brothers, Ram, Surendra, Tārak, Niranjan, and others arrived at
the temple garden. Lātu, Harish, and Hazra were staying with the Master.
When M. saluted Sri Ramakrishna, the Master asked: "Where is Narendra? Isn't he
coming?" M. told him that Narendra could not come.
A brahmin devotee was reading to the Master from a book of devotional songs by
Ramprasad. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to continue. The brahmin read a song, the first
line of which was: "O Mother, put on Thy clothes."
MASTER: "Stop, please! These ideas are outlandish and bizarre. Read something that will
awaken bhakti."
The brahmin read:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. . . .
MASTER (to M.): "I got a pain because I lay too long on one side while in samādhi
yesterday at Adhar's house; so now I'll take Baburam with me when I visit the houses of
the devotees. He is a sympathetic soul"
With these words the Master sang:
How shall I open my heart,O friend?
It is forbidden me to speak.
I am about to die, for lack of a kindred soul
To understand my misery.
Simply by looking in his eyes,
I find the beloved of my heart;
But rare is such a soul, who swims in ecstatic bliss
On the high tide of heavenly love.
MASTER: "The Bauls sing songs like that. They also sing another kind of song:
556Stay your steps, O wandering monk!
Stand there with begging-bowl in hand,
And let me behold your radiant face.
Signs of a perfect soul
"According to the Śakti cult the siddha is called a koul, and according to the Vedānta, a
paramahamsa. The Bauls call him a sai. They say, 'No one is greater than a sai.' The sai
is a man of supreme perfection. He doesn't see any differentiation in the world. He wears
a necklace, one half made of cow bones and the other of the sacred tulsi-plant. He calls
the Ultimate Truth 'Ālekh', the 'Incomprehensible One'. The Vedas call It 'Brahman'.
About the jivas the Bauls say, 'They come from Ālekh and they go unto Ālekh.'
That is to say, the individual soul has come from the Unmanifest and goes back to the
Unmanifest. The Bauls will ask you, 'Do you know about the wind?' The 'wind' means the
great currrent that one feels in the subtle nerves, Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, when the
Kundalini is awakened. They will ask you further, 'In which station are you dwelling?'
According to them there are six 'stations', corresponding to the six psychic centres of
Yoga. If they say that a man dwells in the 'fifth station', it means that his mind has
climbed to the fifth centre, known as the Viśuddha chakra. (To M.) At that time he sees
the Formless."
Saying this the Master sang:
Within the petals of this flower there lies concealed a subtle
space,
Transcending which, one sees at length the universe in Space
dissolve.
Description of the Bauls
"Once a Baul came here. I asked him, 'Have you finished the task of "refining the
syrup"? Have you taken the pot off the stove?' The more you boil the juice of sugar-
cane, the more it is refined. In the first stage of boiling it is simply the juice of the
sugar-cane. Next it is molasses, then sugar, then sugar candy, and so on. As it goes on
boiling, the substances you get are more and more refined.
"When does a man take the pot off the stove? That is, when does a man come to the
end of his sadhana? He comes to the end when he has acquired complete mastery over
his sense-organs. His sense-organs become loosened and powerless, as the leech is
loosened from the body when you put lime on its mouth. In that state a man may live
with a woman, but he does not feel any lust for her.
"Many of the Bauls follow a 'dirty' method of spiritual discipline. It is like entering a
house through the back door by which the scavengers come.
"One day I was taking my meal when a Bāul devotee arrived. He asked me, 'Are you
yourself eating, or are you feeding someone else?' The meaning of his words was that
557the siddha sees God dwelling within a man. The siddhas among the Bauls will not talk to
persons of another sect; they call them 'strangers'.
"The Bauls designate the state of perfection as the 'sahaja', the 'natural' state. There are
two signs of this state. First, a perfect man will not 'smell of Krishna'. Second, he is like
the bee that lights on the lotus but does not sip the honey. The first means, that he
keeps all his spiritual feelings within himself. He doesn't show outwardly any sign of
spirituality. He doesn't even utter the name of Hari. The second means that he is not
attached to woman. He has completely mastered his senses.
"The Bauls do not like the worship of an image. They want a living man. That is why one
of their sects is called the Kartabhaja. They worship the karta, that is to say, the guru,
as God.
Different paths leading to God
"You see how many opinions there are about God. Each opinion is a path. There are
innumerable opinions and innumerable paths leading to God."
BHAVANATH: "Then what should we do?"
Devotion to one's own path and respect for others'
MASTER: "You must stick to one path with all your strength. A man can reach the roof of
a house by stone stairs or a ladder or a rope-ladder or a rope or even by a bamboo pole.
But he cannot reach the roof if he sets foot now on one and now on another. He should
firmly follow one path. Likewise, in order to realize God a man must follow one path with
all his strength.
"But you must regard other views as so many paths leading to God. You should not feel
that your path is the only right path and that other paths are wrong. You mustn't bear
malice toward others.
"Well, to what path do I belong? Keshab Sen used to say to me: 'You belong to our path.
You are gradually accepting the ideal of the formless God.' Shashadhar says that I
belong to his path. Vijay, too, says that I belong to his―Vijay's― path."
The tides in the Ganges
Sri Ramakrishna walked toward the Panchavati with M. and a few other devotees. It was
midday and time for the flood-tide in the Ganges.
They waited in the Panchavati to see the bore of the tide.
MASTER (to the devotees): "The ebb-tide and flood-tide are indeed amazing. But notice
one thing. Near the sea you see ebb-tide and flood-tide in a river, but far away from the
sea the river flows in one direction only. What does this mean? Try to apply its
significance to your spiritual life. Those who live very near God feel within them the
558currents of bhakti, bhava, and the like. In the case of a few―the Isvarakotis, for
instance―one sees even mahabhava and prema.
(To M.) "What is the explanation of the ebb-tide and flood-tide?"
M: "According to Western astronomy, they are due to the attraction of the sun and the
moon."
In order to explain it, M. drew figures on the earth and began to show the Master the
movement of the earth, the sun, and the moon.
The Master looked at the figures for a minute and said: "Stop, please! It gives me a
headache."
Presently the tide came up the Ganges. They heard the sound of the rushing water. The
tide struck the bank of the river and flowed toward the north. Sri Ramakrishna looked at
it intently and exclaimed like a child: "Look at that boat! I wonder what is going to
happen to it."
The Master and M. sat down for a while in the Panchavati, Sri Ramakrishna placing his
umbrella on the cement platform. The conversation turned to Narayan. The boy was a
student. Sri Ramakrishna looked upon him as Narayana, God Himself, and was very fond
of him.
MASTER: "Have you noticed Naran's nature? He can mix with all, old and young. One
cannot do this without a special power.
Besides, all love him. Is he really artless?"
M: "I think so."
MASTER: "I understand that he goes to your place. Is that so?"
M: "Yes, sir. He has visited me once or twice."
MASTER: "Will you give him a rupee? Or shall I ask Kāli about it?"
M: "Very well, sir. I shall give him the money."
MASTER: "That's fine. It is good to help those who yearn for God. Thus one makes good
use of one's money. What will you gain by spending everything on your family?"
Kishori had several children. His salary was too small to support his family. Sri
Ramakrishna said to M.: "Naran said he would get a job for Kishori. Please remind him of
it."
559The Master walked away in the direction of the pine-grove. Returning to the Panchavati,
he said to M.: "Please ask someone to spread a mat outside my room. I shall lie down a
few minutes. I am coming presently."
When the Master returned to his room, he could not find his umbrella and exclaimed:
"You have all forgotten the umbrella! The busybody doesn't see a thing even when it is
very near him. A man went to a friend's house to light the charcoal for his smoke,
though all the time he had a lighted lantern in his hand. Another man looked everywhere
for his towel. Finally he discovered that it had been on his shoulder all the time."
It was about one o'clock in the afternoon. The Master ate the prasad from the Kāli
temple. Then he wanted to rest awhile, but the devotees were still sitting in his room.
They were asked to go out, and then the Master lay down. He said to Baburam, "Come
here; sit near me." Baburam answered, "I am preparing betel-leaf." The Master said,"Put
your betel-leaf aside"
The devotees sat under the bakul-tree in the Panchavati. Tārak, who had just returned
from Vrindāvan, told them stories of his visit.
A little later Sri Ramakrishna was seated again on his couch, the devotees sitting on the
floor. Shyamdas was singing with his party.
He sang of the gopis' grief at their separation from Sri Krishna:
Dry as a desert seemed the happy lake to them:
The chatak died of thirst, gazing toward the clouds.
The Master became somewhat abstracted, but the musician could not create a spiritual
atmosphere. Sri Ramakrishna asked Nabai of Konnagar to sing a kirtan. Nabai was
Manomohan's uncle. He lived on the bank of the Ganges, devoting his time to prayer and
meditation, and was a frequent visitor of Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar.
Master in ecstasy
Nabai began the kirtan in a loud voice. The Master left the couch and began to dance.
Immediately Nabai and other devotees began to dance around him. The atmosphere
became intense with spiritual fervour.
After the kirtan, Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat. With great feeling he began to sing
of the Divine Mother, his eyes turned upward:
O Mother, ever blissful as Thou art,
Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss!
My mind knows nothing but Thy Lotus Feet.
The King of Death scowls at me terribly;
Tell me, Mother, what shall I say to him? . . .
He sang again:
560As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;
And faith is the root of all. . . .
He continued:
This world, O Mother, is Thy madhouse!
What can I say of all Thy virtues?
Setting aside Thine elephant, Thou roamest about on foot;
Putting off Thy gems and pearls, O Self-willed Mother,
Thou dost adorn Thy comely neck with a garland of human
heads.
Now Thou must rescue Ramprasad out of the forest of this
world.
Again he sang:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or
Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli's name upon my
lips? . ..
And again:
Dwell, O mind, within yourself; Enter no other's home.
If you but seek there, you will find All you are searching for. . .
.
And then:
The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet. . . .
And then:
Cherish my precious Mother Syama
Tenderly within, O mind;
May you and I alone behold Her,
Letting no one else intrude. . . .
As the Master sang this last song he stood up. He was almost intoxicated with divine
love. Again and again he said to the devotees,
" Cherish my precious Mother Syama tenderly within."
Then he danced and sang:
Is Kāli, my Mother, really black?
The Naked One, of blackest hue,
Lights the Lotus of the Heart. . . .
The Master reeled as he sang. Niranjan came forward to hold him. The Master said to
him softly, "Don't touch me, you rascal!"
Seeing the Master dance, the devotees stood up. He caught hold of M.'s hand and said:
"Don't be foolish! Dance!"
561Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat, still charged with divine ecstasy. Coming down a little
to the normal state, he said: "Om! Om! Om!
Om! Om! Om Kāli!" Again he said, "Let me have a smoke." Many of the devotees stood
around. Mahimacharan was fanning him. The Master asked him to sit down and recite
from the scriptures. Mahimacharan recited from the Mahanirvana Tantra:
Om; I bow to Thee, the Everlasting Cause of the world;
I bow to Thee, Pure Consciousness, the Soul that sustains the whole universe.
I bow to Thee, who art One without duality, who dost bestow liberation;
I bow to Thee, Brahman, the all-pervading Attributeless Reality.
Thou alone art the Refuge, the only Object of adoration;
Thou art the only Cause of the universe, the Soul of everything that is;
Thou alone art the world's Creator, Thou its Preserver and Destroyer;
Thou art the immutable Supreme Lord, the Absolute; Thou art unchanging Consciousness.
Dread of the dreadful! Terror of the terrible!
Refuge of all beings! Purity of purifiers!
Thou alone dost rule over those in the high places,
Supreme over the supreme, the Protector of protectors.
Almighty Lord, who art made manifest as the Form of all, yet art Thyself unmanifest and
indestructible;
Thou who art imperceptible to the senses, yet art the very Truth;
Incomprehensible, imperishable, all-pervading, hidden, and without form;
O Lord! O Light of the Universe! Protect us from harm.
On that One alone we meditate; that One is the sole object of our worship;
To That alone, the non-dual Witness of the Universe, we bow.
In that One who alone exists and who is our sole eternal Support, we seek, refuge,
The self-dependent Lord, the Vessel of Safety in the ocean of existence.
Sri Ramakrishna listened to the hymn with folded hands. After it was sung he saluted
Brahman; the devotees did likewise.
Adhar arrived from Calcutta and bowed down before the Master.
MASTER (to M.): "We have had such joy today! How much joy Hari's name creates! Is it
not so?"
M: "Yes, sir."
Mahimacharan was a student of philosophy. That day he too had chanted the name of
Hari and danced during the kirtan. This made the Master very happy.
It was about dusk. Many of the devotees took their leave. A lamp was lighted in Sri
Ramakrishna's room and incense was burnt.
After some time the moon came out, flooding the sky with its light.
562Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his couch. He was in a spiritual mood, absorbed in
contemplation of the Divine Mother. Now and then he chanted Her hallowed name. Adhar
was sitting on the floor. M. and Niranjan, too, were there. Sri Ramakrishna began to talk
to Adhar.
MASTER: "What! You have come just now! We have had so much kirtan and dancing.
Shyamdas began the kirtan. He is Ram's music teacher. But I didn't enjoy his singing
very much; I didn't feel like dancing. Later I heard about his character. I was told that
he had as many mistresses as there are hairs on a man's head.
"Didn't you get the job?"
Adhar held the post of deputy magistrate, a government post that carried with it great
prestige. He earned three hundred rupees a month. He had applied for the office of vice-
chairman of the Calcutta Municipality. The salary attached to this office was one
thousand rupees. In order to secure it, Adhar had interviewed many influential people in
Calcutta.
MASTER (to M. and Niranjan): "Hazra said to me, 'Please pray to the Divine Mother for
Adhar, that he may secure the job.' Adhar made the same request to me. I said to the
Mother: 'O Mother, Adhar has been visiting You. May he get the job if it pleases You.' But
at the same time I said to Her: 'How small-minded he is! He is praying to You for things
like that and not for Knowledge and Devotion.'
(To Adhar) "Why did you dance attendance on all those small-minded people? You have
seen so much; you have heard so much!
After reading the entire Ramayana, to ask whose wife Sita is!' "
ADHAR: "A man cannot but do these things if he wants to lead a householder's life. You
haven't forbidden us to, have you?"
Advice to Adhar about renunciation
MASTER: "Nivritti alone is good, and not pravritti. Once, when I was in a God-intoxicated
state, I was asked to go to the manager of the Kāli temple to sign the receipt for my
salary. They all do it here. But I said to the manager: 'I cannot do that. I am not asking
for any salary. You may give it to someone else if you want.' I am the servant of God
alone. Whom else shall I serve? Mallick noticed the late hours of my meals and arranged
for a cook. He gave me one rupee for a month's expenses. That embarrassed me. I had
to run to him whenever he sent for me. It would have been quite a different thing if I
had gone to him of my own accord.
"In leading the worldly life one has to humour mean-minded people and do many such
things. After the attainment of my exalted state, I noticed how things were around me
and said to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother! Please change the direction of my mind right
now, so that I may not have to flatter rich people.'
563(To Adhar) "Be satisfied with the job you have. People hanker after a post paying fifty or
a hundred rupees, and you are earning three hundred rupees! You are a deputy
magistrate. I saw a deputy magistrate at Kamarpukur. His name was Ishwar Ghosha! He
had a turban on his head. Men's very bones trembled before him. I remember having
seen him during my boyhood. Is a deputy magistrate a person to be trifled with?
"Serve him whom you are already serving. The mind becomes soiled by serving but one
master. And to serve five masters!
"Once a woman became attached to a Mussalman and invited him to her room. But he
was a righteous person; he said to her that he wanted to use the toilet and must go
home to get his water-jar for water. The woman offered him her own, but he said: 'No,
that will not do. I shall use the jar to which I have already exposed myself. I cannot
expose myself before a new one.' With these words he went away. That brought the
woman to her senses. She understood that a new water-jar, in her case, signified a
paramour."
Narendra was in straitened circumstances on account of his father's unexpected death.
He had been seeking a job to maintain his mother, brothers, and sisters. He had served
a few days as headmaster of the Vidyasagar School at Bowbazar.
ADHAR: "May I ask if Narendra would accept a job?"
MASTER: "Yes, he would. He has his mother, brothers, and sisters to support."
ADHAR: "Well, Narendra can support his family with fifty or with a hundred rupees. Will
he try for a hundred?"
MASTER: "Worldly people think highly of their wealth. They feel that there is nothing like
it. Sambhu said, 'It is my desire to leave all my property at the Lotus Feet of God.' But
does God care for money? He wants from His devotees knowledge, devotion,
discrimination, and renunciation.
"After the theft of the jewelry from the temple of Radhakanta, Mathur Babu said: 'O God,
You could not protect Your own jewelry! What a shame!' Once he wanted to give me an
estate and consulted Hriday about it. I overheard the whole thing from the Kāli temple
and said to him: 'Please don't harbour any such thought. It will injure me greatly.' "
ADHAR: "I can tell you truthfully, sir, that not more than six or seven persons like you
have been born since the creation of the world."
MASTER: "How so? There certainly are people who have given up everything for God. As
soon as a man gives up his wealth, people come to know about him. But it is also true
that there are others unknown to people. Are there not such holy men in upper India?"
ADHAR: "I know of at least one such person in Calcutta. He is Devendranath Tagore."
564MASTER: "What did you say? Who has enjoyed the world as much as he? Once I visited
him at his house with Mathur Babu. I saw that he had many young children. The family
physician was there writing out prescriptions.
If, after having eight children, a man doesn't think of God, then who will? If, after,
enjoying so much wealth, Devendranath hadn't thought of God, then people would have
cried shame upon him."
NIRANJAN: "But he paid off all his father's debts."
MASTER: "Keep quiet! Don't torment me any more. Do you call anyone a man who
doesn't payoff his father's debts if he is able to?
But I admit that Devendranath is infinitely greater than other worldly men, who are sunk
in their worldliness. They can learn much from him.
Signs of a real devotee
There is an ocean of difference between a real all-renouncing devotee of God and a
householder devotee. A real sannyāsi, a real devotee who has renounced the world, is
like a bee. The bee will not light on anything but a flower. It will not drink anything but
honey.
But a devotee leading the worldly life is like a fly. The fly sits on a festering sore as well
as on a sweetmeat. One moment he enjoys a spiritual mood, and the next moment he is
beside himself with the pleasure of 'woman and gold'.
"A devotee who has really and truly renounced all for God is like the chatak bird. It will
drink only the rain-water that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It will rather
die of thirst than touch any other water, though all around there may lie seven oceans
and rivers full to the brim with water. An all-renouncing devotee will not touch 'woman
and gold'. He will not keep 'woman and gold' near him lest he should feel attached."
ADHAR: "But Chaitanya, too, enjoyed the world."
MASTER (amazed): "What? What did he enjoy in the world?"
ADHAR: "Scholarship! Honour!"
MASTER: "It was honour in the sight of others, but nothing to him. Whether you―a
deputy magistrate―or this youngster Niranjan honours me, it is all the same to me. And
I tell you this truthfully: the idea of controlling a wealthy man never enters my mind.
Surendra once said, rather condescendingly, that Rākhāl's father could sue me for letting
Rākhāl stay with me. When I heard this from Manomohan, I said: 'Who is this Surendra?
How does he dare make a remark like that? He keeps a carpet and pillow here and gives
me some money. Is that his excuse for daring to make such an impudent remark?' "
ADHAR: "I understand that he gives ten rupees a month. Isn't that so?"
565MASTER: "That covers two months expenses. The devotees stay here and he gives the
money for their service. It is he who earns the merit. What is that to me? Is it for my
personal gain that I love Narendra, Rākhāl, and the others?"
M: "Your love for them is like a mother's for her children."
Master's genuine love for his disciples
MASTER: "But even behind the mother's love lies her hope that the children will support
her later on. But I love these youngsters because I see in them Narayana Himself. These
are not mere words.
God takes charge of His devotees
(To Adhar) "Listen. There is no scarcity of moths when the lamp is lighted. When God is
realized, He Himself provides everything for His devotees. He sees that they do not lack
anything. When God is enshrined in the heart, many people come forward to offer their
services.
"Once a young sannyasi went to a householder to beg his food. He had lived as a monk
from his very birth; he knew nothing of worldly matters. A young daughter of the
householder came out to give him alms; He turned to her mother and said, 'Mother, has
this girl abscesses on her chest?' The mother said: 'No, my child. God has given her
breasts to nurse her child when she becomes a mother.' Thereupon the sannyasi said:
'Then why should I worry about myself? Why should I beg my food? He who has created
me will certainly feed me.'
"Listen. If a woman renounces everything for her paramour, she can say to him, if need
be, 'You wretch! I shall sit on your chest and devour you.'
"Nangta told me of a certain king who gave a feast to the sādhus, using plates and
tumblers of gold. I noticed in the monasteries at Benares with what great respect the
abbots were treated. Many wealthy up-country people stood before them with folded
hands, ready to obey their commands. But a true sādhu, a man who has really
renounced everything, seeks neither a gold plate nor honour.
God sees that he lacks nothing. God gives the devotee everything that is needed for
realizing Him.
(To Adhar) "You are an executive officer. What shall I say to you? Do whatever you think
best. I am an illiterate person."
ADHAR (smiling, to the devotees): "Now he is examining me."
MASTER (smiling) : "Dispassion alone is good. Don't you see, I didn't sign the receipt for
my salary? God alone is real and all else is illusory."
Hazra entered the room and sat with the devotees on the floor. Hazra repeated now and
then, "Soham! Soham!" "I am He! I am He!"
566To Lātu and other devotees he often said: "What does one gain by worshipping God with
offerings? That is merely giving Him things that are His already." He had said this once
to Narendra.
The Master spoke to him.
MASTER: "I explained to Lātu who the object of the devotee's worship is."
HAZRA: "The devotee really prays to his own Self."
MASTER: "What you say is a very lofty thought. The aim of spiritual discipline, of
chanting God's name and glories, is to realize just that. A man attains everything when
he discovers his true Self in himself. The object of sādhanā is to realize that. That also is
the purpose of assuming a human body. One needs the clay mould as long as the gold
image has not been cast; but when the image is made, the mould is thrown away. The
body may be given up after the realization of God.
"God is not only inside us; He is both inside and outside. The Divine Mother showed me
in the Kāli temple that everything is Chinmaya, the Embodiment of Spirit; that it is She
who has become all this―the image, myself, the utensils of worship, the door-sill, the
marble floor. Everything is indeed Chinmaya.
"The aim of prayer, of spiritual discipline, of chanting the name and glories of God, is to
realize just that. For that alone a devotee loves God. These youngsters are on a lower
level; they haven't yet reached a high spiritual state. They are following the path of
bhakti. Please don't tell them such things as 'I am He'."
Like the mother bird brooding over her chicks, Sri Ramakrishna was alert to protect his
devotees.
Adhar and Niranjan went out on the porch to take refreshments. Presently they returned
to the room.
ADHAR (smiling): "We talked about so many things. (Pointing to M.) But he didn't utter a
word."
MASTER: "In Keshab's organization there was a young man with four university degrees.
He laughed when he saw people arguing with me. He said: 'To argue with him! How
silly!' I saw him again, later on, at one of Keshab's meetings. But then he did not have
the same bright complexion."
Sri Ramakrishna sat on the floor for his supper. It was a light meal of a little farina
pudding and one or two luchis that had been offered in the Kāli temple. M. and Lātu
were in the room. The devotees had brought various sweets for the Master. He touched
a sandesh and asked Lātu, "Who is the rascal that brought this?" He took it out of the
cup and left it on the ground. He said to Lātu and M.: "I know all about him. He is
immoral"
567LĀTU: "Shall I give you this sweet?"
MASTER: "Kishori brought it."
LĀTU: "Will it suit you?"
MASTER (smiling): "Yes."
M. had received an English education. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "It is not possible for
me to eat things offered by anyone and everyone. Do you believe this?"
M: "Gradually I shall have to believe all these things."
MASTER: "Yes, that is so."
After finishing the meal Sri Ramakrishna washed his mouth. He said to M., "Then will you
give the rupee to Naran?" "Yes," said M., "certainly I will."
The moon rose in the clear autumn sky and was reflected in the river. It was ebb-tide in
the Ganges and the river flowed south toward the sea.
Sunday, September 14, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Narendra, Bhavanath, the Mukherji
brothers, and other devotees. Rākhāl was staying with Balarām at Vrindāvan and was
laid up with an attack of fever. Narendra was preparing himself for his coming law
examination.
About eleven o'clock Jnan Babu arrived. He was a government official and had received
four university degrees.
MASTER (at the sight of Jnan Babu): "Well! Well! This sudden awakening of
'knowledge'!"
JNAN (smiling): "You must admit, sir, that one sees the awakening of knowledge as a
result of very good fortune."
MASTER (smiling): "You are Jnan. Then why should you have ajnan, ignorance? Oh, I
understand. Where there is knowledge there is also ignorance. The sage Vasishtha was
endowed with great knowledge and still he wept at the death of his sons. Therefore I ask
you to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance. The thorn of ignorance has pierced the
sole of a man's foot. He needs the thorn of knowledge to take it out. Afterwards he
throws away both thorns. The Jnāni says, 'This world is a "framework of illusion".' But he
who is beyond both knowledge and ignorance describes it as a 'mansion of mirth'. He
sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe, all living beings, and the
twenty-four cosmic principles.
568Living in the world after realization of God
"A man can live in the world after attaining God. Then he can lead the life of
detachment. In the country I have seen the women of the carpenter families making
flattened rice with a husking-machine. With one hand one of them turns the paddy in the
hole and with the other she holds a nursing child. At the same time she talks with the
buyer. She says to him: 'You owe me two ānnās . Pay it before you go.' But seventy-five
per cent of the woman's mind is on her hand lest it should be crushed by the pestle of
the husking machine.
"A man should do his worldly duties with only twenty-five percent of his mind, devoting
the rest to God."
Referring to Pundit Shashadhar, the Master said to the devotees, "I found him
monotonous―engaged in the dry discussion of philosophy.
"He alone who, after reaching the Nitya, the Absolute, can dwell in the Lila, the Relative,
and again climb from the Lila to the Nitya, has ripe knowledge and devotion. Sages like
Nārada cherished love of God after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman. This is called
vijnāna.
"Mere dry knowledge is like an ordinary rocket: it bursts into a few sparks and then dies
out. But the Knowledge of sages like Nārada and Sukadeva is like a good rocket: for a
while it showers balls of different colours, and then it stops; again it throws out new
balls, and again it stops; and thus it goes on. Those sages had prema for God. Prema is
the rope by which one can reach Satchidananda."
The Master finished his midday meal and rested a few minutes. Bhavanath, M., the
Mukherji brothers, Hazra, and several other devotees sat down under the bakul-tree and
began to converse. The Master stopped there awhile on his way to the pine-grove.
HAZRA (to the younger Gopal): "Please prepare a smoke for him [meaning the Master]."
MASTER (smiling): "Why don't you admit that you want it?" (All laugh.)
MUKHERJI (to Hazra): "You must have learnt much wisdom from him [meaning the
Master]."
MASTER (smiling): "No, he has been wise like this from his boyhood." (All laugh.)
Presently Sri Ramakrishna returned from the pine-grove. The devotees noticed that he
was in an ecstatic mood and was reeling like a drunkard. After reaching his room he
regained the normal state.
Many devotees gathered in the room. Among them was a new-comer, a sadhaka from
Konnagar, who looked over fifty years of age and seemed to have great vanity of
scholarship.
569The Master stood in the middle of the room and suddenly said to M., "He came
here―Naran."
Narendra was engaged in a discussion with Hazra and a few others on the verandah.
They could be heard from the room.
MASTER (referring to Narendra): "The chatterbox! But he is now much worried about his
family."
M.: "Yes, sir, it is true."
MASTER: "Once he said that he would look upon adversity as his good fortune. Isn't that
so?"
M: "He has great strength of mind."
A DEVOTEE: "Does he lack strength in anything?"
Pointing to the sadhaka from Konnagar, a devotee said to the Master: "Sir, he has come
to visit you. He has some questions to ask."
The sadhaka was seated erect, his chin up.
SADHAKA: "Sir, what is the way?"
MASTER: "Faith in the guru's words. One attains God by following the guru's instructions
step by step. It is like reaching an object by following the trail of a thread."
SADHAKA: "Is it possible to see God?"
MASTER: "He is unknowable by the mind engrossed in worldliness. One cannot attain
God if one has even a trace of attachment to 'woman and gold'. But He is knowable by
the pure mind and the pure intelligence―the mind and intelligence that have not the
slightest trace of attachment. Pure Mind, Pure Intelligence, Pure Ātman are one and the
same thing."
SADHAKA: "But the scriptures say, 'From Him words and mind return baffled.' He is
unknowable by mind and words."
MASTER: "Oh, stop! One cannot understand the meaning of the scriptures without
practising spiritual discipline. What will you gain by merely uttering the word 'siddhi'?
The pundits glibly quote the scriptures; but what will that accomplish? A man does not
become intoxicated even by rubbing siddhi on his body; he must swallow it. What is the
use of merely repeating, 'There is butter in the milk'?
Turn the milk into curd and churn it. Only then will you get butter."
570SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. But you too are quoting the scriptures."
MASTER: "What will one gain by merely quoting or hearing the scriptures? One must
assimilate them. The almanac makes a forecast of the rainfall for the year, but you won't
get a drop by squeezing its pages."
SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. Have you done it yourself?"
MASTER: "You don't have to bother about what I have or haven't done. Besides, it is
very difficult to explain these things to others.
Suppose someone asks you, 'What does ghee taste like?' Your answer will be, 'Ghee
tastes like ghee.'
"To understand these things one needs to live with holy men, just as to understand the
pulse of bile, of phlegm, and so on, one needs to live with a physician."
SADHAKA: "There are some people who are irritated by others' company."
MASTER: "That happens only after the attainment of Knowledge, after the realization of
God. Shouldn't a beginner live in the company of holy men?"
The sadhaka sat in silence a few moments. Then he said with some irritation: "Please tell
me whether you have realized God either directly or intuitively. You may answer me if
you are able, or you may keep silent if you wish." The Master said with a smile: "What
shall I say? One can only give a hint."
SADHAKA: "Then tell us that much."
Narendra was going to sing. He said, "No one has brought a pakhoaj."
THE YOUNGER GOPAL: "Mahimacharan has one."
MASTER (interrupting): "No, we don't want anything of his here."
A devotee from Konnagar sang a song. Every now and then Sri Ramakrishna glanced at
the sadhaka. The singer and Narendra became engaged in a furious discussion about
musical technique. The sadhaka said to the singer, "What is the use of such
discussions?" Referring to another man who had joined in the discussion, Sri
Ramakrishna said to the sadhaka, "Why didn't you scold him, too?" It could be seen that
the sadhaka was not on friendly terms with his companions from Konnagar.
Narendra sang:
O Lord, must all my days pass by so utterly in vain?
Down the path of hope I gaze with longing, day and night. . . .
571The sadhaka closed his eyes in meditation as he listened to the song. It was four o'clock
in the afternoon. The rays of the setting sun fell on his body. Sri Ramakrishna quickly
opened an umbrella and placed it near the door so that the sun might not disturb the
sadhaka.
Narendra sang again:
How shall I call on Thee, O Lord, with such a stained and
worldly mind?
Can a straw remain unharmed, cast in a pit of Raming coals?
Thou, all goodness, art the fire, and I, all sin, am but a straw:
How shall I ever worship Thee?
The glory of Thy name, they say, redeems those even past
redeeming;
Yet, when I chant Thy sacred name, alas! my poor heart quakes
with fright.
I spend my life a slave to sin; how can I find a refuge, then,
O Lord, within Thy holy way?
In Thine abounding kindliness, rescue Thou this sinful wretch;
Drag me off by the hair of my head and give me shelter at Thy
feet.
Again he sang:
Sweet is Thy name, O Refuge of the humble!
It falls like sweetest nectar on our ears
And comforts us, Beloved of our souls!
The priceless treasure of Thy name alone
Is the abode of Immortality,
And he who chants Thy name becomes immortal.
Falling upon our ears, Thy holy name
Instantly slays the anguish of our hearts,
Thou Soul of our souls, and fills our hearts with bliss!
As Narendra sang the line, "And he who chants Thy name becomes immortal", the
Master went into samādhi. At first his fingers, especially the thumbs, began to tremble.
The devotees from Kannagar had never seen the Master in samādhi. Seeing him silent,
they were about to leave the room. Bhavanath said to them: "Why are you going away?
This is his samādhi." The devotees resumed their places.
Narendra sang:
I have laboured day and night
To make Thy seat within my heart;
Wilt Thou not be kind to me,
O Lord of the World, and enter there?
Sri Ramakrishna, still in the ecstatic mood, came dawn from his couch to the floor and
sat by Narendra. The beloved disciple sang again:
572In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full,
And Love's flood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.
O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . .
As Narendra sang the last line, Sri Ramakrishna stood up, still absorbed in samādhi.
Futility of mere study of scriptures
After a long time the Master regained partial consciousness of the world and sat down on
the mat. Narendra finished his singing, and the Tānpura was put back in its place. The
Master was still in a spiritual mood and said: "Mother, tell me what this is. They want
someone to extract the butter for them and hold it to their mouths. They won't throw the
spiced bait into the lake. They won't even hold the fishing-rod. Someone must catch the
fish and put it into their hands! How troublesome! Mother, I won't listen to any more
argument.
The rogues force it on me. What a bother! I shall shake it off. God is beyond the Vedas
and their injunctions. Can one realize Him by studying the scriptures, the Vedas, and the
Vedānta? (To Narendra) Do you understand this? The Vedas give only a hint"
Narendra wanted the Tānpura again. The Master said, "I want to sing." He was still in an
ecstatic mood and sang:
Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart,
That even with Thee for Mother, and though I am wide awake,
There should be robbery in my house. . .
The Master said, "Mother, why do You make me argue?" He sang again:
Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood;
From One who knows it well, I have learnt the secret of
bhava…
The Master said, "I am quite conscious." But he was still groggy with divine fervour. He
sang once more:
I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,
As I repeat my Mother Kāli's name;
It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk!...
Futility of reasoning
Sri Ramakrishna had said, "Mother, I won't listen to any more argument."
Narendra sang:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .
573Sri Ramakrishna said with a smile: "O Mother, make me mad! God cannot be realized
through knowledge and reasoning, through the arguments in the scriptures." He had
been pleased with the singing of the musician from Konnagar and said to him humbly:
"Please sing about the Divine Mother. Please - one song."
MUSICIAN: "You must excuse me, sir."
MASTER (bowing with folded hands): "No, sir. I can enforce this demand."
Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna sang a few lines from a kirtan, assuming the attitude of a
gopi:
Radha has every right to say it;
She has kept awake for Krishna.
She has stayed awake all night,
And she has every right to be piqued.
Then he said to the musician: "My dear sir, you are a child of the Divine Mother. She
dwells in all beings. Therefore I have every right to enforce my demand. A farmer said to
his guru, 'I shall get my mantra from you by beating you, if I have to.' "
MUSICIAN (smiling): "By a shoe-beating?"
MASTER (smiling): "No! I won't go that far."
Again in an abstracted mood Sri Ramakrishna said: "The beginner, the struggling, the
perfect, and the supremely perfect. Which are you―perfect or supremely perfect? Come
along! Sing for us."
The musician complied. He sang just a melody.
MASTER: "My dear sir, that too makes me happy."
The musician then sang a song. When the music was over, the devotees from Konnagar
saluted the Master and took their leave.
The sadhaka bowed before him with folded hands and said, "Holy man, let me say good-
bye."
Sri Ramakrishna, still in an ecstatic mood, was talking to the Divine Mother.
MASTER: "Mother, is it You or I? Do I do anything? No. no! It is You.
Was it You who heard the arguments all this time, or was it I? No, not I. It was You.".
Sri Ramakrishna became conscious of the outer world and began to converse with
Narendra, Bhavanath, and the other devotees.
574They were talking about the sadhaka.
BHAVANATH (smiling): "What kind of man is he?"
MASTER: "He is a tamasic devotee."
BHAVANATH: "He can certainly recite Sanskrit verses."
MASTER: "Once I said to a man about a sādhu: 'He is a rajasic sādhu. Why should one
give him food and other presents?' At this another sādhu taught me a lesson by saying
to me: 'Don't say that. There are three classes of holy men: sattvic, rajasic, and
tamasic.' Since that day I have respected holy men of all classes."
NARENDRA (smiling): "What? Is it like the 'elephant God'? All, indeed, are God."
MASTER (smiling): "It is God Himself who sports in the world as both vidyā and avidyā.
Therefore I salute both. It is written in the Chandi: 'The Divine Mother is the good
fortune of the blessed and the ill fortune of the unlucky.' (To Bhavanath) Is that
mentioned in the Vishnu Purana?"
BHAVANATH (smiling): "I don't know, sir. The devotees from Konnagar did not
understand your samādhi and were about to leave the room."
MASTER: "Who was it that asked them to remain?"
BHAVANATH (smiling): "It was I."
MASTER: "My child, you are equally good in bringing people here and in driving them
away."
The conversation turned to the argument that Narendra had had with the musician from
Konnagar.
MUKHERJI: "Narendra didn't spare him."
MASTER: "That's right. One needs such grit. This is called the influence of tamas on
sattva. Must a man listen to everything another man says? Should one say to a
prostitute, 'All right, you may do whatever you like'? Must one listen to her? At one time
Radha was piqued. A friend said, 'Her ego has been roused.' Brinde, another friend, said:
'Whose is this' ego? Her ego belongs to Krishna alone. She is proud in the pride of
Krishna.' "
Glory of God's name
The conversation turned to the glory of God's name.
BHAVANATH: "I feel such relief while chanting the name of Hari."
575MASTER: "He who relieves us of sin is Hari. He relieves us of our three afflictions in the
world. Chaitanya preached the glory of Hari's name; so it must be good. You see, he was
such a great scholar, and an Incarnation too. Since he preached that name, it must be
good. (Smiling) Once some peasants were invited to a feast. They were asked if they
would eat a preparation of hog plum. They answered: 'You may give it to us if the
gentlemen have eaten it. If they enjoyed it, then it must be good.' (All laugh.)
(To the Mukherji brothers) "I should like to visit Shivanath; I won't have to hire a
carriage if you take me in yours."
MUKHERJI: "All right, sir, we shall set a day."
MASTER (to the devotees): "Do you think the Brahmos will like me? They criticize those
who believe in God with form."
Mahendra Mukherji wanted to go on a pilgrimage. He told Sri Ramakrishna so.
MASTER (smiling): "How is that? Do you want to go when the sprout of divine love has
hardly corne up? First comes the sprout, then the tree, then the fruit. We are so happy
to have you here to talk to."
MAHENDRA: "I feel like visiting the holy places a little. I shall return soon."
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna left his room. The devotees
were walking in the garden. Many of them were about to leave.
The Master was conversing with Hazra on the north verandah. They were talking of
Narendra's frequent visits to Annada, the eldest son of the Guhas.
HAZRA: "I hear that Annada is now practising austerity. He lives on very little food and
eats rice once every four days."
MASTER: "Is that so? 'Who knows? One may realize God even by means of a religious
garb.'"
HAZRA: "Narendra sang the Āgamani ."
MASTER (eagerly): "How did he sing it?"
Kishori stood close by. The Master said to him, "Are you well?"
A little later the Master was standing on the west porch. Since it was autumn, he had put
on a flannel shirt dyed with ochre. He asked Narendra, "Is it true that you sang the
Āgamani ?"
Accompanied by Narendra and M., Sri Ramakrishna walked to the embankment of the
Ganges.
576Narendra sang the Āgamani :
Tell me, my Uma, how have you fared, alone in the Stranger's
house?
People speak so much ill of us! Alas, I die of shame!
My Son-in-law smears His body with ashes from the funeral
pyre
And roams about in great delight;
You too, along with Him, cover with ash your golden skin.
He begs the food that He eats! How can I bear it, being your
mother?
This time, when He returns to claim you, I shall say to Him,
"My daughter Umā is not at home."
Sri Ramakrishna stood listening to the song and went into samādhi. The sun was still
above the horizon as the Master stood on the embankment in the ecstatic mood. On one
side of him was the Ganges, flowing north with the flood-tide. Behind him was the flower
garden. To his right one could see the nahabat and the Panchavati. Narendra stood by
his side and sang. Gradually the darkness of evening fell upon the earth.
After Narendra and several other devotees had saluted the Master and left for Calcutta,
Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room. He was absorbed in meditation on the Divine
Mother and was chanting Her holy name.
Master at Jadu's garden
Jadu Mallick had arrived at his garden house next to the Kāli temple. He sent for the
Master. Adhar, too, had arrived from Calcutta, and he saluted Sri Ramakrishna. The
Master asked Lātu to light the lantern and accompany him to Jadu's garden.
MASTER (to M.): "Why didn't you bring Naran with you?"
M: "Shall I come with you?"
MASTER: "Do you want to come? Adhar and the others are here. All right, you may
come. Will the Mukherjis also come with us? (To the Mukherjis) Come along. Then we
can leave Jadu-Mallick quickly."
The Master went to Jadu's drawing-room. It was a well furnished room, with everything
spick and span. The lamps were lighted. Jadu was sitting with his friends and was
playing with the children. Servants were in attendance. Smiling, Jadu welcomed Sri
Ramakrishna, but he did not get up. He treated the Master as a friend of long
acquaintance.
Jadu was a devotee of Gaurānga. He had just seen a performance of Gaurānga's life at
the Star Theatre and told the Master about it. The Master listened to his account joyfully
and played with the children. M. and the Mukherji brothers sat near him. In the course of
the conversation Sri Ramakrishna told Jadu that Adhar had not been able to secure the
577post of vice-chairman of the Calcutta Municipality. Jadu said that Adhar was still young
and could try for it again. At his request the Master sang a few songs about Gaurānga.
After the music was over, the Mukherjis were about to take their leave. The Master, too,
was ready to go, but he was in an ecstatic mood. On coming to the porch he went into
samādhi. The gate-keeper of the garden house was a pious man. Now and then he
invited the Master to his house and fed him. Sri Ramakrishna stood there in samādhi and
the gate-keeper fanned him with a large fan. Ratan, the manager of the garden house,
saluted the Master, and Sri Ramakrishna, returning to the consciousness of the relative
world, greeted the manager and the gate-keeper, saying, "Narayana". Then,
accompanied by the devotees, he went back to the temple- garden through the main
gate.
MASTER (to the Mukherjis, pointing to M.): "Please visit him often."
MUKHERJI (smiling): "Yes, henceforth he will be our teacher."
MASTER: "It is the nature of the hemp-smoker to make merry in the company of another
hemp-smoker. He will not talk even to an amir, but he will embrace a wretched hemp-
smoker if he happens to meet one." (All laugh.)
It was about nine o'clock. The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master and went away.
Adhar and M. sat on the floor in the Master's room while he talked to Adhar about Rākhāl
.
His worry over Rākhāl 's illness
Rākhāl was staying in Vrindāvan with Balarām. The Master had learnt from a letter
about Rākhāl 's illness. He was so worried about him that two or three days earlier he
had wept before Hazra like a child. Adhar had sent a registered letter to Rākhāl but had
received no reply.
MASTER (to Adhar): "Naran has received a letter from Vrindāvan. Why haven't you
received a reply to yours?"
ADHAR: "I haven't yet heard from Vrindāvan."
MASTER: "M. has also received a letter from Vrindāvan."
They began to talk of Sri Ramakrishna's seeing a play, at the Star Theatre, about the life
of Cauranga.
MASTER (smiling): "Jadu told me that one could see the play very well from a one-rupee
seat. Very cheap! Once we were talking about going to Panihati. Jadu wanted me to go
in a country boat with a whole crowd of passengers. (All laugh.)
"Formerly he liked to hear a little about God. But I don't see Jadu much nowadays. He is
always surrounded by flatterers. They have spoiled him. He is a man of a very
578calculating nature. I would no sooner set foot in his house than he would ask me,. 'How
much is the carriage hire?' I would say: 'You don't have to bother about it. You may give
two and a half rupees.' That would keep him quiet." (All laugh.)
It was late. Adhar was about to depart. The Master asked M. to bring Naran with him.
--------------------
579Chapter 28
AT THE STAR THEATRE
Friday, September 19, 1884
IT WAS MAHALAYA, a sacred day of the Hindus, and the day of the new moon. At two
o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Mahendra Mukherji,
Priya Mukherji, M., Baburam, Harish, Kishori, and Lātu. Some were sitting on the floor,
some standing, and others moving about. Hazra was sitting on the porch. Rākhāl was
still at Vrindāvan with Balarām.
Master praises Captain's devotion
MASTER (to the devotees): "I was at Captain's house in Calcutta. It was very late when I
returned. What a sweet nature Captain has! What devotion! He performs the Ārati
before the image. First he waves a lamp with three lights, then a lamp with one light,
and last of all he waves burning camphor. When performing the worship he does not
speak. Once he motioned to me to take my seat. During the worship his eyes become
swollen from spiritual emotion. They look as if they have been stung by wasps. He
cannot sing, but he chants hymns beautifully. In his mother's presence he sits on a lower
level; she sits on a high stool.
"His father was a havildar in the English army. He would hold a gun with one hand and
with the other worship Śiva. His servant made a clay image of Śiva for him. He wouldn't
even touch water before performing the worship. He earned six thousand rupees a
year.
"Captain sends his mother to Benares now and then. Twelve or thirteen servants attend
her there; it is very expensive. Captain knows the Vedānta, the Gitā, and the Bhagavata
by heart. He says that the educated gentlemen of Calcutta follow the ways of the
mlechchhas.
"In his earlier years he practised hathayoga. That is why he strokes my head gently
when I am in samādhi. His wife worships the Deity in another form-that of Gopala. This
time I didn't find her so miserly. She too knows the Gitā and other scriptures. What
devotion they have!
"They cooked a goat curry. Captain said they could eat it for fifteen days, but she said,
'No, no! Only seven days.' But I liked the taste of it. They serve a very small quantity of
each dish, but nowadays they give me good portions since I eat more than they do. After
the meal either Captain or his wife fans me.
"They are very pious souls and show great respect to holy men. The people of upper
India are greatly devoted to sādhus. The sons and nephews of the Jung Bahadur of
Nepal once visited the temple garden; before me they showed great respect and
humility. Once a young girl of Nepal came to see me with Captain. She was a great
580devotee, and unmarried; she knew the whole of the Gitagovinda by heart. Dwarika Babu
and the others wanted to hear her music. When she sang the Gitagovinda, Dwarika Babu
was profoundly moved and wiped the tears from his eyes with his handkerchief. She was
asked why she was not married. She said: 'I am the handmaid of God. Whom else shall I
serve?' Her people respect her as a goddess, as the scriptures enjoin.
(To Mahendra Mukherji and the others) "I shall feel very happy to know that you are
being benefited by your visits here. (To M.) Why do people come here? I don't know
much of reading and writing."
M.: "God's power is in you. That is why there is such power of attraction. It is the Divine
Spirit that attracts."
MASTER: "Yes, this is the attraction of Yogamaya, the Divine Śakti. She casts the spell.
God performs all His lila through the help of Yogamaya.
Nature of gopis' love for Krishna
"The love of the gopis was like the attachment of a woman to her paramour. They were
intoxicated with ecstatic love for Sri Krishna. A woman cherishing illicit love is not very
keen about her own husband. If she is told that her husband has come, she will say:
'What if he has? There is food in the kitchen. He can help himself.' But if she is told of
the arrival of a stranger-jovial, handsome, and witty-she will run to see him and peep at
him from behind a screen.
"You may raise an objection and say: 'We have not seen God. How can we feel attracted
to Him as the gopis felt attracted to Krishna?' But it is possible. 'I do not know Him. I
have only heard His name, and that has fixed my mind upon Him.' "
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the significance of Sri Krishna's stealing the gopis' clothes?"
MASTER: "There are eight fetters that bind a person to the world. The gopis were free
from all but one: shame. Therefore Krishna freed them from that one, too, by taking
away their clothes. On attaining God one gets rid of all fetters. (To Mahendra Mukherji
and the others) By no means all people feel attracted to God. There are special souls
who feel so. To love God one must be born with good tendencies. Otherwise, why should
you alone of all the people of Baghbazar come here? You can't expect anything good in a
dunghill. The touch of the Malaya breeze turns all trees into sandal-wood, no doubt. But
there are a few exceptions-the banyan, the cotton-tree, and the Aśwattha, for example.
(To the Mukherji brothers) "You are well off. If a man slips from the path of yoga, then
he is reborn in a prosperous family and starts again his spiritual practice for the
realization of God."
Unfulfilled desires make one deviate from yoga
MAHENDRA: "Why does one slip from the path of yoga?"
581MASTER: "While thinking of God the aspirant may feel a craving for material enjoyment.
It is this craving that makes him slip from the path. In his next life he will be born with
the spiritual tendencies that he failed to translate into action in his present life."
MAHENDRA: "Then what is the way?"
MASTER: "No salvation is possible for a man as long as he has desire, as long as he
hankers for worldly things. Therefore fulfil all your desires regarding food, clothes, and
sex. (Smiling) What do you say about the last one? Legitimate or illegitimate? (M. and
Mahendra laugh.)
"It is not good to cherish desires and hankerings. For that reason I used to fulfil
whatever desires came to my mind. Once I saw some coloured sweetmeats at
Burrabazar and wanted to eat them. They brought me the sweets and I ate a great
many. The result was that I fell ill.
"In my boyhood days, while bathing in the Ganges, I saw a boy with a gold ornament
around his waist. During my state of divine intoxication I felt a desire to have a similar
ornament myself. I was given one, but I couldn't keep it on very long. When I put it on,
I felt within my body the painful uprush of a current of air. It was because I had touched
gold to my skin. I wore the ornament a few moments and then had to put it aside.
Otherwise I should have had to tear it off.
"I once felt a desire to eat the famous sweetmeats of different cities. (All laugh.) I had a
desire to hear Sambhu's musical recital of the Chandi. After fulfilling that desire I wanted
to hear the same thing by Rajnarayan. That desire also was satisfied.
"At that time many holy men used to visit the temple garden. A desire arose in my mind
that there should be a separate store-room to supply them with their provisions. Mathur
Babu arranged for one. The sādhus were given food-stuffs, fuel, and the like from that
store-room.
"Once the idea came to me to put on a very expensive robe embroidered with gold and
to smoke a silver hubble-bubble. Mathur Babu sent me the new robe and the hubble-
bubble. I put on the robe. I also smoked the hubble-bubble in various fashions.
Sometimes I smoked it reclining this way, and sometimes that way, sometimes with
head up, and sometimes with head down. Then I said to myself, 'O mind, this is what
they call smoking a silver hubble-bubble.' Immediately I renounced it. I kept the robe on
my body a few minutes longer and then took it off. I began to trample it underfoot and
spit on it, saying: 'So this is an expensive robe! But it only increases man's rajas.'"
About Rākhāl
Rākhāl had been staying at Vrindāvan with Balarām. At first he had written excited
letters praising the holy place. He had written to M.: "It is the best of all places. Please
come here. The peacocks dance around, and one always hears and sees religious music
and dancing. There is an unending flow of divine bliss." But then Rākhāl had been laid up
582with an attack of fever. Sri Ramakrishna was very much worried about him and vowed to
worship the Divine Mother for his recovery. So he began to talk about Rākhāl.
MASTER: "Rākhāl had his first religious ecstasy while sitting here massaging my feet. A
Bhagavata scholar had been expounding the sacred book in the room. As Rākhāl listened
to his words, he shuddered every now and then. Then he became altogether still.
"His second ecstasy was at Balarām Bose's house. In that state he could not keep
himself sitting upright; he lay flat on the floor. Rākhāl belongs to the realm of the
Personal God. He leaves the place if one talks about the Impersonal.
"I have taken a vow to worship the Divine Mother when he recovers. You see, he has
renounced his home and relatives and completely surrendered himself to me. It was I
who sent him to his wife now and then. He still had a little desire for enjoyment.
(Pointing to M,) "Rākhāl has written him from Vrindāvan that it is a grand place-the
peacocks dance around. Now let the peacock's take care of him. He has really put me in
a fix.
Balarām's devotion
"Rākhāl has been staying with Balarām at Vrindāvan. Ah, what a nice nature Balarām
has! It is only for my sake that he doesn't go to Orissa, where his family owns an estate.
His brother stopped his monthly allowance and wrote to him: 'Come and stay with us
here. Why should you waste so much money in Calcutta?' But he didn't listen. He has
been living in Calcutta because he wants to see me.
What devotion to God! He is busy day and night with his worship. His gardener is always
making garlands of flowers for the Deity, He has decided to spend four months a year at
Vrindāvan to reduce his expenses. He gets a monthly allowance of two hundred rupees.
"Why am I so fond of the youngsters? They are still untouched by 'woman arid gold'. I
find that they belong to the class of the nityasiddhas, the everperfect."
Narendra's first visit
"When Narendra first came here he was dressed in dirty clothes; but his eyes and face
betokened some inner stuff. At that time he did not know many songs. He sang one or
two: 'Let us go back once more, O mind, to our own abode!' and 'O Lord, must all my
days pass by so utterly in vain?'
"Whenever he came here, I would talk only with him, though the room was filled with
people. He would say to me, 'Please talk to them', and then I would talk with the others.
"I became mad for the sight of him and wept for him in Jadu Mallick's garden house: 'I
wept here, too, holding Bholanath's hand.' Bholanath said, 'Sir, you shouldn't behave
that way for a mere kayastha boy.' One day the 'fat brahmin' said to me about
Narendra, with folded hands, 'Sir, he has very little education; why should you be so
restless for him?'
583"Bhavanath and Narendra are a pair. They are like man and woman. So I asked
Bhavanath to rent a house near Narendra's. Both of them belong to the realm of the
formless Reality.
Master warns the devotees about women
"I forbid the youngsters to spend a long time with women or visit them too frequently.
Haripada has fallen into the clutches of a woman of the Ghoshpara sect. She shows
maternal feeling for him; but Haripada is a child and doesn't understand its real
meaning. The women of that sect act that way when they see young boys. I understand
that Haripada lies on her lap and that she feeds him with her own hands. I shall tell him
that this is not good. This very maternal feeling leads to a downfall. The women of that
sect practise spiritual discipline in the company of men; they regard men as Krishna. A
teacher of that sect asks a woman devotee, 'Have you found your Krishna?' and she
says, 'Yes, I have found my Krishna.'
"The other day that woman came here. I watched the way she looked around and I
didn't approve of it. I said to her, 'You may treat Haripada any way you like, but don't
have any wrong feeling for him.'
"The youngsters are now in the stage of sadhana. They are aspirants. For them the only
thing now is renunciation. A sannyasi must not look even at the portrait of a woman. I
say to them: 'Don't sit beside a woman and talk to her, even if she is a devotee. You
may say a word or two to her, standing.' Even a perfect soul must follow this precept for
his own protection and also to set an example to others. When women, come to me, I
too say to them after a few minutes, 'Go and visit the temples.' If they don't get up, I
myself leave the room. Others will learn from my example.
Master's attraction for people
"Can you tell me why all these youngsters, and you people, too, visit me? There must be
something in me; or why should you all feel such a pull, such attraction?
His own reminiscences
"Once I visited Hriday's house at Sihore. From there I was taken to Syambazar. I had a
vision of Cauranga before I entered the village, and I realized that I should meet
Cauranga's devotees there. For seven days and nights I was surrounded by a huge
crowd of people. Such attraction! Nothing but kirtan and dancing day and night. People
stood in rows on the walls and even were in the trees.
"I stayed at Natavar Goswami's house. It was crowded day and night. In the morning I
would run away to the house of a weaver for a little rest. There too I found that people
would gather after a few minutes. They carried drums and cymbals with them, and the
drum constantly played:'Takuti! Takuti!' We would have our meal at three in the
afternoon.
"The rumour spread everywhere that a man had arrived who died seven times and came
back to life again. Hriday would drag me away from the crowd to a paddy-field for fear I
584might have an attack of heat apoplexy. The crowd would follow us there like a line of
ants. Again the cymbals and the never-ending Takuti! Takuti!' of the drums. Hriday
scolded them and said: 'Why do you bother us like this? Have we never heard kirtan?'
"The Vaishnava priests of the village came and almost started a quarrel. They thought I
would take their share of the fees from the devotees. But soon they discovered that I
didn't touch a piece of cloth or even a thread. Someone remarked that I was a
Brahmajnani. So the Vaishnava pundits wanted to test me. One said, 'Why hasn't he
beads, and a mark on his forehead?' Another of them replied, They have dropped from
him, as the dry branch from a coconut tree. It was there that I learnt this illustration of
the dry branch of a coconut tree. The upadhis, limitations, drop when one attains
Knowledge.
"People came thronging from distant villages. They even spent the night there. At
Syambazar I learnt the meaning of divine attraction. When God incarnates Himself on
earth He attracts people through the help of Yogamaya, His Divine Power. People
become spellbound."
It was about three o'clock in the afternoon. The Master had been conversing with the
Mukherji brothers and the other devotees, when Radhika Goswami, a Vaishnava scholar,
arrived and bowed before him. This was his first visit to the Master. Radhika Goswami
took a seat.
MASTER: "Are you a descendant of Advaita?"
GOSWAMI: "Yes, sir."
At this the Master saluted him with folded hands.
MASTER: "You are descended from Advaita Goswami. You must have inherited some of
his traits. A sweet-mango tree produces only sweet mangoes arid not sour ones. Of
course, it happens that some trees produce large mangoes and some small; that
depends on the soil. Isn't that true?"
GOSWAMI (humbly): "Sir, what do I know?"
MASTER: "Whatever you may say, others will not let you off so easily. Brahmans,
however imperfect they-may be, are worshipped by all on account of their having been
born in the lines of great sages. (To M.) Tell us the story of the samkhachila."
M. sat in silence.
MASTER: "If one of your ancestors was a great soul, he will certainly pull you up,
however unworthy you may be. When King Duryodhana and his brothers were taken
captive by the gandharvas, Yudhisthira released them in spite of the fact that King
Duryodhana was his enemy and had banished him to the forest.
585"Besides, one must show respect to the religious garb. Even the mere garb recalls to
mind the real object. Chaitanya once dressed an ass in a religious garb and then
prostrated himself before it.
"Why do people bow before a samkhachila? When Kamsa was about to kill the Divine
Mother, She Hew away taking the form of a samkhachila. So even now people salute the
bird.
"An Englishman arrived at the cantonment of Chanak. The sepoys saluted him. Koar
Singh explained to me: 'India is under the rule of the English. Therefore one should
salute an Englishman.
"The Saktas follow the Tantra, and the Vaishnavas the Purana. There is no harm for the
Vaishnavas in speaking publicly of their spiritual practices. But the Saktas maintain
secrecy about theirs. For this reason it is difficult to understand a Sakta.
(To Goswami) "You are all good people. How much japa you practise! How much you
chant the name of Hari!"
GOSWAMI (humbly): "Oh, no! We do very little. I am a great sinner."
MASTER (smiling): "You have humility. That is good. But there is also another way: 'I
chant the name of Hari. How can I be a sinner?' He who constantly repeats: 'I am a
sinner! I am a wretch!' verily becomes a sinner. What lack of faith! A man chants the
name of God so much, and still he talks of sin!"
Radhika Goswami listened to these words in amazement.
Master's following of different paths
MASTER: "At Vrindāvan I myself put on the garb of the Vaishnavas and wore it for
fifteen days. (To the devotees) I have practised the disciplines of all the paths, each for
a few days. Otherwise I should have found no peace of mind. (Smiling) I have practised
all the disciplines; I accept all paths. I respect the Saktas, the Vaishnavas, and also the
Vedantists. Therefore people of all sects come here. And everyone of them thinks that I
belong to his school. I also respect the modern Brahmajnanis.
"A man had a tub of dye. Such was its wonderful property that people could dye their
clothes any colour they wanted by merely dipping them in it. A clever man said to the
owner of the tub, 'Dye my cloth the colour of your dye-stuff.' (All laugh.)
"Why should I be one-sided? The idea that the people of a particular sect will not come
to me does not frighten me. I don't care a bit whether people come to me or not. The
thought of keeping anyone under my control never crosses my mind. Adhar Sen asked
me to ask the Divine Mother for a big position for him, but he didn't get it. If that makes
him think differently about me, what do I care?
586"Once at Keshab's house I found myself in a new mood. The Brahmos always speak of
the Impersonal; therefore I said to the Divine Mother in an ecstatic mood: 'Mother,
please don't come here. They don't believe in Your forms.'"
Radhika Goswami listened to these words of the Master against sectarianism and
remained silent.
Master's praise of Vijay Goswami
ASTER (smiling): "Vijay is in a wonderful state of mind nowadays. He falls to the ground
while chanting the name of Hari. He devotes himself to kirtan, meditation, and other
spiritual practices till four in the morning. He now puts on an ochre robe and prostrates
himself before the images of God. Once he accompanied me to Gadadhar's schoolhouse.
I pointed out the place where Gadadhar
used to meditate. At once Vijay prostrated himself there. Again he fell prostrate before
the picture of Chaitanyadeva."
GOSWAMI: "What about the image of Radha-Krishna?"
MASTER: "He prostrated himself there too. Vijay also follows all the conventions of
religious life."
GOSWAMI: "He can now be accepted in Vaishnava society."
MASTER: "People's opinions don't count for much with him."
GOSWAMI: "I don't mean that. By accepting him Vaishnava society will honour itself."
MASTER: "He respects me very much. But it is difficult to reach him. One day he is called
to Dāccā, the next day to some other place. He is always busy. His presence has created
great trouble in the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj."
GOSWAMI: "Why so, sir?"
MASTER: The Brahmos tell him: 'You mix with people who worship God with form. You
are an idolater.' Vijay is liberal and straightforward. Unless a man is guileless, he
doesn't receive the grace of God. Sri Ramakrishna talked to the Mukherji brothers.
Mahendra, the elder, had his own business. Priyanath, the younger, had been an
engineer. After making some provision for himself, he had given up his job. Mahendra
was thirty-five or thirty-six years old. The brothers had homes both in the country and in
Calcutta.
MASTER (smiling): "Don't sit idle simply because your spiritual consciousness has been
awakened a little. Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandalwood there are other and
more valuable things-silver-mines, gold-mines, and so on."
Bondage and freedom are of the mind
587PRIYA (smiling): "Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot go forward."
MASTER: "What if the legs are chained? The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of
the mind, and freedom also is of the mind.
"Listen to a story. There were two friends. One went into a house of prostitution and the
other to hear a recital of the Bhagavata. 'What a shame!' thought the first. 'My friend is
hearing spiritual discourse, but just see what I have slipped down to!' The second friend
said to himself: 'Shame on me! My friend is having a good time, but how stupid I am!'
After death the soul of the first was taken to Vaikuntha by the messenger of Vishnu,
while that of the second was taken to the nether world of Yama."
PRIYA: "But the mind is not under my control."
MASTER: "How is that? There is such a thing as abhyiisayoga, yoga through practice.
Keep up the practice and you will find that your mind will follow in whatever direction
you lead it. The mind is like a white cloth just returned from the laundry. It will be red if
you dip it in red dye and blue if you dip it in blue. It will have whatever colour you dip it
in.
(To Goswami) "Have you anything to ask?"
GOSWAMI: "No, sir. I am satisfied that I have seen you and have been I listening to
your words."
MASTER: "Go and visit the temples."
GOSWAMI (very humbly): "Won't you please sing something about Sri Chaitanya?"
The Master complied. He sang:
Why has My body turned so golden?It is not time for this to
be:
Many the ages that must pass, before as Gaurānga I appear! . .
Again:
Gora gazes at Vrindāvan and tears stream from his eyes;
In an exuberance of joy, he laughs and weeps and dances and
sings.
He takes a wood for Vrindāvan, the ocean for the blue
Jamuna;
He rolls on the ground for love of Hari.
After singing, the Master went on with the conversation.
MASTER (to Goswami): "I have sung these songs to suit your Vaishnava temperament.
But I must sing differently when the Saktas or others come.
588"Herepeople of all sects come-Vaishnavas, Saktas, Kartabhajas,Vedantists, and also
members of the modern Brahmo Samaj. Therefore one finds here all ideals and
attitudes. It is by the will of God that different religions and opinions have come into
existence. God gives to different people what they can digest. The mother does not give
fish pilau to all her children. All cannot digest it; so she prepares simple fish soup for
some. Everyone cherishes his own special ideal and follows his own nature.
"They provide various images for the Baroari because people of different sects assemble
at it. You see there images of Radha-Krishna, Śiva-Durga, and Sita-Rāma-different
images in different places. A crowd gathers before each image. The Vaishnavas spend
most of their time before the image of Radha-Krishna, the Saktas before Śiva-Durga,
and the devotees of Rāma before Sita-Rāma.
"But it is quite different with those who are not spiritually minded at all. In the Baroari
one sees another image also-a prostitute beating her paramour with a broomstick. Those
people stand there with gaping mouths and cry to their friends: 'What are you looking at
over there? Come here! Look at this!' " (All laugh.)
Radhika Goswami saluted the Master and took his leave.
It was about five o'clock. The Master was on the semicircular west porch. Baburam, Lātu,
the Mukherji brothers, M., and some other devotees were with him.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Why should I be one-sided? The goswamis belong to
the Vaishnava school and are very bigoted. They think that their opinion alone is right
and all other opinions are wrong. My words have hit him hard. (Smiling) One must strike
the elephant on the head with the goad; that is the elephant's most sensitive spot."
Then Sri Ramakrishna told a few naughty jokes for the young men.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I don't give the youngsters a pure vegetarian diet: now and
then I give them a little water smelling of fish. Otherwise, why should they come?"
The Mukherji brothers left the porch. They went to the garden for a stroll.
MASTER (to M.): "I wonder whether the Mukherjis have taken offence at my jokes?"
M: "Why should they? Captain said that you are like a child. After realizing God a man
becomes childlike."
MASTER: "Yes, and sometimes he behaves like a boy, and sometimes like a young man.
As a boy he is very light-hearted. He may use frivolous language. As a young man he is
like a roaring lion while teaching others. You had better explain my state of mind to the
Mukherjis."
M: "I don't have to do that. Haven't they the sense to see it?"
589Again the Master became light-hearted with the boys. Then he said to one of the
devotees: "Today is the new moon. Go to the Kāli temple in the evening."
It was dusk. They heard the sound of gongs, cymbals, and other instruments used in the
evening service in. the temples. The Master said to Baburam, "Come with me to the Kāli
temple." He and Baburam went toward the temple, accompanied by M. At the sight of
Harish sitting on the porch, the Master said: "What is this? Is he in ecstasy?"
Going through the courtyard, the Master and the devotees stopped a minute in front of
the Radhakanta temple to watch the worship. Then they proceeded to the shrine of Kāli.
With folded hands the Master prayed to the Divine Mother: "O Mother! O Divine Mother!
O Brahmamayi!"
Reaching the raised platform in front of the shrine, he bowed low before the image. The
Ārati was going on. He entered the shrine and fanned the image.
The evening worship was over. The devotees bowed before the Deity. It was the night of
the new moon. The Master was in a spiritual mood. Gradually his mood deepened into
intense ecstasy. He returned to his room, reeling like a drunkard and holding to
Baburam's hand.
Master's prayer to Divine Mother
A lamp was lighted on the west porch. The Master sat there a few minutes, chanting:
"Hari Om! Hari Om! Hari Om!" and other mystic syllables of the Tantra. Presently he
returned to his room and sat on the small couch, facing the east. He was still completely.
absorbed in divine fervour. He said to the Divine Mother: "Mother, that I should first
speak and You then act-oh, that's nonsense! What is the meaning of talk? It is nothing
but a sign. One man says, 'I shall eat.' Again, another says, 'No! I won't hear of it.' Well,
Mother, suppose I had said I would not eat; wouldn't I still feel hungry? Is it ever
possible that You should listen only when one prays aloud and not when one feels an
inner longing? You are what You are. Then why do I speak? Why do I pray? I do as You
make me do. Oh, what confusion! Why do You make me reason?"
As Sri Ramakrishna was thus talking to God, the devotees listened wonder-struck to his
words. The Master's eyes fell upon them.
MASTER (to the devotees): "One must inherit good tendencies to realize God, One must
have done something, some form of tapasya, either in this life or in another.
"When Draupadi's clothes were being taken off, she cried earnestly, praying to God. God
revealed Himself to her and said: 'Try to remember whether you have ever made a gift
of a cloth to anyone. Then your modesty will be preserved.' Draupadi replied: 'Yes, I
remember now. Once a rishi was taking his bath when his loin-cloth was carried away by
the current. I tore off half my cloth and gave it to him.' Thereupon the Lord said, 'Then
you have nothing to fear.' "
M. was sitting on the small foot-rug.
590MASTER (to M.): "You have understood what I said."
M: "Yes, sir. You spoke about inherent tendencies."
MASTER: "Repeat what I said."
M. repeated the story of Draupadi.
Hazra entered the room. He had been living with Sri Ramakrishna in the temple garden
for the past two years and had first met the Master in 1880 at Sihore in the house of
Hriday, the Master's nephew. Hazra's native village was near Sihore, and he owned some
property there. He had a wife and children and also some debts. From youth he had felt
a spirit of renunciation and sought the company of holy men and devotees. The Master
had asked him to live with him at Dakshineswar and looked after his necessities. Hazra's
mind was a jumble of undigested religious moods. He professed the path of knowledge
and disapproved of Sri Ramakrishna's attitude of bhakti and his longing for the young
devotees. Now and then he thought of the Master as a great soul, but again he slighted
him as an ordinary human being. He spent much of his time in telling his beads, and he
criticized Rākhāl and the other young men for their indifference to the practice. He was a
strong advocate of religious conventions and rules of conduct, and made a fad of them.
He was about thirty-eight years old.
As Hazra came in, the Master became a little abstracted and in that mood began to talk.
MASTER (to Hazra): "What you are doing is right in principle, but the application is not
quite correct. Don't find fault with anyone, not even with an insect. As you pray to God
for devotion, so also pray that you may not find fault with anyone."
HAZRA: "Does God listen to our prayer for bhakti?"
MASTER: "Surely. I can assure you of that a hundred times. But the prayer must be
genuine and earnest. Do worldly-minded people weep for God as they do for wife and
children? At Kamarpukur the wife of a certain man fell ill. The man thought she would
not recover; he began to tremble and was about to faint. Who feels that way for God?"
Hazra was about to take the dust of the Master's feet.
MASTER (shrinking): "What is this?"
HAZRA: "Why should I not take the dust of his feet who has so kindly kept me with
him?"
MASTER: "Satisfy God and everyone will be satisfied.'If He is pleased the world is
pleased.' Once the Lord ate a few greens from Draupadi's cooking-pot and said, 'Ah, I
am satisfied.' Immediately the whole world and all its living beings were satisfied; they
felt as if they had eaten their fill. But was the world satisfied or did it feel that way when
the rishis ate their food?
591(To Hazra) "A perfect soul, even after attaining Knowledge, practises devotions or
observes religious ceremonies to set an example to others. I go to the Kāli temple and I
bow before the holy pictures in my room; therefore others do the same. Further, if a
man has become habituated to such ceremonies, he feels restless if he does not observe
them.
"One day I saw a sannyasi under the banyan-tree. He had put the salagram on the same
carpet with his guru's sandals. He was worshipping them. I said to him, 'If you have
attained Knowledge to that extent, then why such formal worship at all?' He replied:
'What difference does it make? Since I do everything else, why not this too? Sometimes
I offer the flowers at the guru's feet and sometimes to God.'
"One cannot renounce work as long as one has a body. As long as there is mud at the
bottom of the lake, bubbles will be produced.
Advice to Hazra - Scriptures and sadhana
(To Hazra) "If there is knowledge of one, there is also knowledge of many. What will you
achieve by mere study of the scriptures? The scriptures contain a mixture of sand and
sugar, as it were. It is extremely difficult to separate the sugar from the sand. Therefore
one should learn the essence of the scriptures from the teacher or from a sādhu.
Afterwards what does one care for books?
(To the devotees) "Gather all the information and then plunge in. Suppose a pot has
dropped in a certain part of a lake. Locate the spot and dive there.
"One should learn the essence of the scriptures from the guru and then practise
sadhana. If one rightly follows spiritual discipline, then one directly sees God. The
discipline is said to be rightly followed only when one plunges in. What will a man gain
by merely reasoning about the words of the scriptures? Ah, the fools! They reason
themselves to death over information about the path. They never take the plunge. What
a pity!
"You may say, even though you dive deep you are still in danger of sharks and
crocodiles, of lust and anger. But dive after rubbing your body with turmeric powder;
then sharks and crocodiles will not come near you. The turmeric is discrimination and
renunciation.
Master's spiritual practice
(To the devotees) "God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths. First
according to the Purana, then according to the Tantra. I also followed the disciplines of
the Vedas. At first I practised sadhana in the Panchavati. I made a grove of tulsi-plants
and used to sit inside it and meditate. Sometimes I cried with a longing Heart, 'Mother!
Mother!' Or I again, 'Rāma! Rāma!'
"While repeating the name of Rāma, I sometimes assumed the attitude of Hanuman and
fixed a tail to the lower end of my backbone. I was in a God-intoxicated state. At that
592time I used to put on a silk robe and worship the Deity. What joy I experienced in that
worship!
"I practised the discipline of the Tantra under the bel-tree. At that time I could see no
distinction between the sacred tulsi and any other plant. In that state I sometimes ate
the leavings from a jackal's meal, food that had been exposed the whole night, part of
which might have been eaten by snakes or other creatures. Yes, I ate that stuff.
"Sometimes I rode on a dog and fed him with luchi, also eating part of the bread myself.
I realized that the whole world was filled with God alone. One cannot have spiritual
realization without destroying ignorance; so I would assume the attitude of a tiger and
devour ignorance.
"While practising the disciplines of the Vedas, I became a sannyasi. I used to lie down in
the chandni and say to Hriday: 'I am a sannyasi. I shall take my meals here.'
"I vowed to the Divine Mother that I would kill myself if I did not see God. I said to Her:
'O Mother, I am a fool. Please teach me what is contained in the Vedas, the Puranas, the
Tantras, and the other scriptures.' The Mother said to me, 'The essence of the Vedānta is
that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory.'The Satchidananda Brahman described
in the Vedas is the Satchidananda Śiva of the Tantra and the Satchidananda Krishna of
the Purana. The essence of the Gitā is what you get by repeating the word ten times. It
is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.
"After the realization of God, how far below lie the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Purana, the
Tantra! (To Hazra) I cannot utter the word 'Om' in samādhi. Why is that? I cannot say
'Om' unless I come down very far from the state of samādhi.
"I had all the experiences that one should have, according to the scriptures, after one's
direct perception of God. I behaved like a child, like a madman, like a ghoul, and like an
inert thing.
"I saw the visions described in the scriptures. Sometimes I saw the universe filled with
sparks of fire. Sometimes I saw all the quarters glittering with light, as if the world were
a lake of mercury. Sometimes I saw the world as if made of liquid silver. Sometimes,
again, I saw all the quarters illumined as if with the light of Raman candles. So you see
my experiences tally with those described in the scriptures.
"It was revealed to me further that God Himself has become the universe and all its
living beings and the twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like the process of evolution and
involution.
"Oh, what a state God kept me in at that time! One experience would hardly be over
before another overcame me. It was like the movement of the husking-machine: no
sooner is one end down than the other goes up.
593"I would see God in meditation, in the state of samādhi, and I would see the same God
when my mind came back to the outer world. When looking at this side of the mirror I
would see Him alone, and when looking on the reverse side I saw the same God."
The devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.
(To the Mukherji brothers) "Captain is now really in the state of the sadhaka. That the
mere possession of wealth should create, attachment is by no means true. Sambhu
Mallick used to say to Hriday, 'Hridu, I have packed my things and am ready for the
journey.' I said to him: 'God forbid! Why do you say such ominous words?' 'No', replied
Sambhu. 'Please bless me that I may cast aside all these possessions and go to God.'
"God's devotees have nothing to fear. They are His own He always stands by them. Once
Duryodhana and his brothers were imprisoned by the gandharvas. It was Yudhisthira
who freed them. Yudhisthira said, 'If our relatives are placed in such a plight, then it is
our disgrace.' "
It was about nine o'clock in the evening. The Mukherji brothers were ready to return to
Calcutta. The Master left his seat and began to pace the room and the porch. He could
hear the kirtan sung in the Vishnu temple. A devotee said that Harish and Lātu were in
the singing party.
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees went to the Vishnu temple and saluted the Deity. The
brahmins belonging to the staff of the temple garden, and also the priests, the cooks,
and the servants, were singing the kirtan. He stood there a few minutes and encouraged
the singers. On the way back to his room he remarked to the devotees, "You see, some
of them polish the metal utensils and some go to houses of prostitution."
The Master returned to his room and took his seat. Presently the singers came and
bowed low before him. The Master said to them: "One should perspire, dancing and
singing the name of God, as people do earning money. I had thought of joining you in
the dancing; but I found that you did everything very well. You had flavoured the curry
with all the seasoning. What could I add? It will be nice if you sing devotional songs that
way now and then."
The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master. Their carriage was ready near the verandah
north of the room. The Master stood facing the north. On his left was the Ganges; in
front of him were the nahabat, the garden, and the kuthi; and to his right was the road
leading to the gate. The night was dark, and a devotee had brought a lantern to show
the visitors their way. One by one the devotees bowed and took the dust of the Master's
feet. The carriage seemed too heavily loaded for the horses. The Master said, "Aren't
there too many people in the carriage?"
Sri Ramakrishna remained standing. As the carriage rolled away, the devotees looked
back at the Master's face beaming with compassion and love.
594Sunday, September 21, 1884
A large number of devotees were in Sri Ramakrishna's room, among them Ram,
Mahendra Mukherji, M., and Chunilal. Chunilal had just returned from Vrindāvan, where
he had gone with Rākhāl and Balarām. The two latter were still there. Nityagopal also
was staying there. The Master began to talk with Chunilal about Vrindāvan.
MASTER: "How is Rākhāl?"
CHUNI: "He is quite well now, sir."
MASTER: "Isn't Nityagopal coming back?"
CHUNI: "He was still there when I left."
MASTER: "Who will bring your family back?"
CHUNI: "Balarām Babu told me he would arrange it with some reliable person. He didn't
mention any name."
Master praises Narayan
Sri Ramakrishna then spoke to Mahendra Mukherji about Narayan, a school-boy sixteen
or seventeen years old, who often visited the Master and was very dear to him.
MASTER: "He is quite guileless, isn't he?"
The very uttering of the word "guileless" filled the Master with great joy.
MAHENDRA: "Yes, sir. Completely guileless."
MASTER: "His mother came here the other day. I was a little frightened to see that she
was a proud woman. That day she found that Captain, you, and many others, too,
visited me. Then she must have realized that she and her son were not the only people
to come here. (All laugh.) There was some sugar candy in the room and she remarked
that it was good. That made her feel there was no scarcity of food here. I happened to
tell Baburam, in front of her, to keep some sweets for himself and Naran. Ganu's mother
said that Naran always bothered his mother for the boat hire to come here. His mother
said to me, 'Please ask Naran to consent to marry.' I replied, 'All that depends on one's
fate.' Why should I interfere? (All laugh.) Naran is indifferent to his studies. His mother
said, 'Please ask him to pay a little more attention.' So I said to Naran, 'Attend to your
studies.' Then his mother said, 'Please tell him seriously.' (All laugh.)
(To Chunilal) "Why doesn't Gopal come here?"
CHUNILAL: "He has been suffering from dysentery."
MASTER: "Is he taking any medicine?"
595Sri Ramakrishna was planning to go to a performance of the Chaitanyalila at the Star
Theatre. Mahendra Mukherji was to take him to Calcutta in his carriage. They were
talking about choosing good seats. Some suggested that one could see the performance
well from the one-rupee gallery. Ram said, "Oh, no! I shall engage a box for him." The
Master laughed. Some of the devotees said that public women took part in the play.
They took the parts of Nimai, Nitai, and others.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I shall look upon them as the Blissful Mother Herself. What
if one of them acts the part of Chaitanya? An imitation custard-apple reminds one of the
real fruit. Once, while going along a road, a devotee of Krishna noticed some babla-
trees. Instantly his mind was thrown into ecstasy. He remembered that the wood of
babla-trees was used for the handles of the spades that the garden of the temple of
Syamasundar was dug with. The trees instantly reminded him of Krishna. I was once
taken to the Maidan in Calcutta to see a balloon go up. There I noticed a young English
boy leaning against a tree, with his body bent in three places. It at once brought before
me the vision of Krishna and I went into samādhi.
"Once Chaitanyadeva was passing through a village. Someone told him that the body of
the drum used in the kirtan was made from the earth of that village, and at once he
went into ecstasy.
"Radha could not control herself at the sight of a cloud or the blue throat of a peacock. It
would at once awaken in her mind the thought of Krishna, and she would go into
ecstasy."
The Master was silent a few moments and then resumed the conversation.
MASTER: "Radha had attained mahabhava. There was no desire behind the ecstatic love
of the gopis. A true lover does not seek anything from God. He prays only for pure love.
He doesn't want any powers or miracles.
Occult powers
"It is very troublesome to possess occult powers. Nangta taught me this by a story. A
man who had acquired occult powers was sitting on the seashore when a storm arose. It
caused him great discomfort; so he said, 'Let the storm stop.' His words could not
remain unfulfilled. At that moment a ship was going full sail before the wind. When the
storm ceased abruptly the ship capsized and sank. The passengers perished and the sin
of causing their death fell to the man. And because of that sin he lost his occult powers
and went to hell.
"Once upon a time a sādhu acquired great occult powers. He was vain about them. But
he was a good man and had some austerities to his credit. One day the Lord, disguised
as a holy man, came to him and said, 'Revered sir, I have heard that you have great
occult powers.' The sādhu received the Lord cordially and offered him a seat. Just then
an elephant passed by. The Lord, in the disguise of the holy man, said to the sādhu,
'Revered sir, can you kill this elephant if you like?' The sādhu said, 'Yes, it is possible.'
596So saying, he took a pinch of dust, muttered some mantras over it, and threw it at the
elephant. The beast struggled awhile in pain and then dropped dead. The Lord said:
'What power you have! You have killed the elephant!' The sādhu laughed. Again the Lord
spoke: 'Now can you revive the elephant?' 'That too is possible', replied the sādhu. He
threw another pinch of charmed dust at the beast. The elephant writhed about a litle and
came back to life. Then the Lord said: 'Wonderful is your power. But may I ask you one
thing? You have killed the elephant and you have revived it. But what has that done for
you? Do you feel uplifted by it? Has it enabled you to realize God?' Saying this the Lord
vanished.
"Subtle are the ways of dharma. One cannot realize God if one has even the least trace
of desire. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fibre
sticking out.
"Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, if you want to realize Me, you will not succeed if you
have even one of the eight occult powers.' This is the truth. Occult power is sure to
beget pride, and pride makes one forget God.
"Once a cross-eyed rich man came here. He said to me: 'You are a paramahamsa. That
is good. You must perform a swastyayana ceremony for me.' What a small-minded
person he was! He called me a paramahamsa and yet wanted me to perform that
ceremony. To secure welfare by means of the swastyayana is to exercise occult power.
"An egotistic person cannot realize God. Do you know what egotism is like? It is like a
high mound, where rain-water cannot collect: the water runs off. Water collects in low
land. There seeds sprout and grow into trees. Then the trees bear fruit.
"Therefore I say to Hazra, 'Never think that you alone have true understanding and that
others are fools.' One must love all. No one is a stranger. It is Hari alone who dwells in
all beings. Nothing exists without Him.
"The Lord said to Prahlada, 'Ask a boon of Me.' 'I have seen You', replied Prahlada. 'That
is enough. I don't need anything else.' But the Lord insisted. Thereupon Prahlada said, 'If
You must give me a boon, let it be that those who have tortured me may not have to
suffer punishment.' The meaning of those words is that it was God who tortured
Prahlada in the form of his persecutors, and, if they suffered punishment, it would really
be God who suffered.
Divine madness
"Radha was mad with prema, ecstatic love of God. But there is also the madness of
bhakti. Hanuman's was such. When he saw Sita entering the fire he was going to kill
Rāma. Then, too, there is the madness of Knowledge. I once saw a Jnāni behaving like a
madman. He came here very soon after the temple garden was dedicated. People said
he belonged to the Brahmo Sabha of Rammohan Roy. He had a torn shoe on one foot, a
stick in one hand, and a potted mango-plant in the other. After a dip in the Ganges he
went to the Kāli temple where Haladhāri was seated. With great fervour he began to
597chant a hymn to the Divine Mother. Then he went up to a dog, held it by the ear, and
ate some of its food. The dog didn't mind. Just at that time I too was about to
experience the state of divine madness. I threw my arm around Hriday's neck and said,
'Oh, Hride! Shall I too fall into that plight?'
Master's God-intoxicated condition
"I became mad. Narayan Shastri came here and saw me roaming about with a bamboo
pole on my shoulder. He said to the people, 'Ah, he is mad!' In that state I could not
observe any caste restrictions. The wife of a low caste man used to send me cooked
greens, and I ate them.
"I touched my head and lips with the leaf-plates from which the beggars ate their food in
the guest-house of the Kāli temple. Thereupon Haladhāri said to me: 'What have you
done? You have taken the food left by beggars. How will you marry off your children?'
These words aroused my anger. Haladhāri was my cousin, older than myself. But could
that restrain me? I said to him: 'You wretch! Isn't it you who take pride in the study of
the Gitā and the Vedānta? Isn't it you who teach people that Brahman alone is real and
the world illusory? And yet you imagine that I shall beget children! May your mouth that
recites from the Gitā be blighted!'
(To M.) "You see, mere study of books avails nothing. One may recite the written part
for the drum glibly from memory, but to play the drum is exceedingly difficult."
The Master continued with the description of his divine madness:
"Once, for a few days, I was out on an excursion with Mathur Babu in his house-boat.
We took the trip for a change of air. During that trip we visited Navadvip. One day I saw
the boatmen cooking their meal and stood and watched them. Mathur said to me, 'What
are you doing there?' I replied with a smile, 'The boatmen are cooking, and their food
looks very good.' Mathur felt that I might ask the boatmen to give me a portion of their
food; so he said: 'Come away! Come away!'
"But I cannot do such a thing now. I am no longer in that mood. Now the food must be
cooked by a brahmin observing ceremonial purity, and be offered to the Deity; then only
can I eat it.
"Oh, what moods I passed through! At Kamarpukur I said to Chine Sankhari and the
other chums of my boyhood days, 'Oh, I fall at your feet and beg of you to utter the
name of Hari.' I was about to prostrate myself before them all. Thereupon Chine said,
'This is the first outburst of your divine love; so you don't see any distinction between
one man and another.' When the storm breaks and raises the dust, then mango and
tamarind trees look the same. One cannot distinguish the one from the other."
A DEVOTEE: "How can a householder keep on with his worldly duties if he is
overwhelmed by such bhakti-madness or Love-madness or Knowledge madness?"
598Two kinds of yogis
MASTER (looking at him): "There are two kinds of yogis, the 'revealed' and the 'hidden'.
The householder may be a 'hidden' yogi. None recognizes him. The householder should
renounce mentally, not outwardly."
RAM: "You talk as if you were consoling children. A householder may be a Jnāni but
never a vijnāni."
MASTER: "He may become a vijnāni in the end. But it is not good to force oneself into
renunciation."
RAM: "Keshab Sen used to say: 'Why do people go to him so much? One day he will
sting them and they will flee from him.' "
MASTER: "Why should I sting people? I say to people: 'Do this as well as that. Do your
worldly duties and call on God as well.' I don't ask them to renounce everything. (With a
smile) One day Keshab was delivering a lecture. He said, 'O Lord, grant us that we may
dive into the river of divine love and go straight to the Ocean of Satchidananda.' The
ladies were seated behind the screen. I said to Keshab, 'How can you all dive once for
all?' Pointing to the ladies, I said: 'Then what would happen to them? Every now and
then you must return to dry land. You must dive and rise alternately.' Keshab and the
others laughed.
"Hazra says to me, 'You love most those endowed with rajas, those who have great
wealth and name and fame.' If that is so, then why do I love people like Harish and
Loto? Why do I love Narendra? He can't even afford salt to season his roast banana!"
Sri Ramakrishna left his from and went toward the pine-grove talking with M. A devotee
followed them with water and towel. The Master was talking about his intended visit to
the Star Theatre. He said to M.: "What Ram says applies to rajasic people. What is the
use of reserving an expensive seat?"
About five o'clock that afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was on his way to Calcutta. M.,
Mahendra Mukherji, and a few other devotees accompanied him in Mahendra's carriage.
Thinking of God, the Master soon went into an ecstatic mood. After a long time he
regained consciousness of the world. He observed: "That fellow Hazra dares teach me!
The rascal!" After a short pause he said, "shall drink some water." He often made such
remarks in order to bring his mind down to the sense plane.
MAHENDRA (to M.): "May I get some refreshments for him?"
M: "No, he won't eat anything now."
MASTER (still in ecstatic mood): "I shall eat."
599Mahendra took the Master to his flour-mill located at Hathibagan. After a little rest Sri
Ramakrishna was to go to the theatre. Mahendra did not care to take him to his own
house, for the Master was not well acquainted with his father. Priyanath, Mahendra's
second brother, was also a devotee of the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on a cot over which a carpet had been spread, and was
engaged in spiritual talk.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Once, while listening to the various incidents of the life
of Chaitanya, Hazra said that these were manifestations of Śakti, and that Brahman, the
All-pervasive Spirit, had nothing to do with them. But can there be Śakti without
Brahman? Hazra wants to nullify the teachings of this place.
Identity of Brahman and Śakti
"I have realized that Brahman and Śakti are identical, like water and its wetness, like fire
and its power to burn. Brahman dwells in all beings as the Bibhu, the All-pervasive
Consciousness, though Its manifestation is greater in some places than in others. Hazra
says, further, that anyone who realizes God must also acquire God's supernatural
powers; that he possesses these powers, though he may or may not use them."
M: "Yes, one must have control over these supernatural powers!" (All laugh)
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, one must have them in one's grasp! How mean! He who has
never enjoyed power and riches becomes impatient for them. But a true devotee never
prays to God for them."
Sri Ramakrishna washed his face. A smoke was prepared for him. He said to M.: "Is. it
dusk now? If it is, I won't smoke. During the twilight hour of the dusk you should give up
all other activities and remember God." Saying this he looked at the hairs on his arm. He
wanted to see whether he could count them. If he could not, it would be dusk.
Master at Star Theatre
About half past eight in the evening the carriage with the Master and the devotees drew
up in front of the Star Theatre on Beadon Street. He was accompanied by M., Baburam,
Mahendra and two or three others. They were talking about engaging seats, when Girish
Chandra Ghosh, the manager of the theatre, accompanied by several officials, came out
to the carriage, greeted the Master, and took him and the party upstairs. Girish had
heard of the Master and was very glad to see him at the theatre. The Master was
conducted to one of the boxes. M. sat next to him; Baburam and one or two devotees
sat behind.
The hall was brilliantly lighted. The Master looked down at the pit and saw that it was
crowded. The boxes also were full. For every box there was a man to fan those who
occupied it. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said to M., with his childlike smile:
"Ah, it is very nice here! I am glad to have come. I feel inspired when I see so many
people together. Then I clearly perceive that God Himself has become everything."
600M: "It is true, sir."
MASTER: "How much will they charge us here?"
M: "They won't take anything. They are very happy that you have come to the theatre."
MASTER: "It is all due to the grace of the Divine Mother."
The Chaitanyalila was about to be performed. It was a play about the early life of Sri
Chaitanya, who was also known as Nimai, Gaur, Gora, and Gaurānga. The curtain rose;
the attention of the audience was fixed on the stage.
The first scene depicts a council of Sin and the Six Passions. On a forest path behind
them walk Viveka, Vairāgya, and Bhakti, engaged in conversation.
Bhakti says to her companions: "Gaurānga is born in Nadia. Therefore the vidyadharis,
the munis, and the rishis have come down to earth in disguise to pay their respects to
him."
She sings:
Blest indeed is the earth! Gora is born in Nadia!
Behold the vidyadharis, coming in chariots toadore him;
Behold the munis and rishis, who come, allured by the spell of Love.
The vidyadharis, munis, and rishis sing a hymn to Gaurānga and adore him as
an Incarnation of God.
Sri Ramakrishna watched the scene and was overpowered with divine ecstasy. He said to
M.: "Look at it! Ah! Ah!"
Sages: O Kesava, bestow Thy grace
Upon Thy luckless servants here!
O Kesava, who dost delight
To roam Vrindāvan's glades and groves!
Goddesses: O Madhava, our mind's Bewitcher!
Sweet One, who dost steal our hearts,
Sweetly playing On Thy flute!
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
Sages: O Thou Eternal Youth of Braja,
Tamer of fierce Kaliya,
Slayer of the afflicted's fear!
601Goddesses: Beloved with the arching eyes
And crest with arching peacock feather,
Charmer of Sri Radha's heart!
Sages: Govardhan's mighty Lifter, Thou,
All garlanded with sylvan flowers!
O Damodara, Kamsa's Scourge!
Goddesses: O Dark One, who dost sport in bliss
With sweet Vrindāvan's gopi maids.
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
As the vidyadharis sang the lines, Beloved with the arching eyes; And crest with arching
peacock feather!, the Master went into deep samādhi. The orchestra played on, but he
was not aware of the outer world.
Another scene: A guest has arrived at the house of Jagannath Misra, Nimai's father. The
boy Nimai plays about, singing with his friends, in a happy mood:
Tell Me, where is My blessed Vrindāvan?
Where is Mother Yaśoda?
Where Father Nanda and Brother Balai?
Where My twin cows, black and white?
Tell Me, where is My magic flute?
My friends Sudāmā and Sridāmā?
Where My Jamuna's bank, My banyan?
Where My beloved gopi maids?
Where is Radha, queen of My heart?
The guest closes his eyes while offering food to the Lord. Nimai runs to him. and eats the
food from the plate. The guest recognizes Nimai as an Incarnation of God and seeks to
please him with the Hymn of the Ten Incarnations. Before taking leave of Gaurānga's
parents he sings:
Glory to Gora, the Source of Bliss!
Hail Gaurānga, Redeemer of earth!
Help of the helpless, Life of the living,
Slayer of fear in the hearts of the fearful!
Age after age we see Thy play
New sports unfolding, moods ever new;
New waves rolling, new tales to be told.
Thou who bearest the whole world's burden,
Shower on us the nectar of Love!
Take away our grief and affliction:
602Thou in Love's pleasure-cave dost dwell.
Hope of the suffering! Chastiser of sin!
Scourge of the wicked! Victory to Thee!
Listening to the hymn, the Master was thrilled with ecstasy.
The next scene is at Navadvip on the bank of the Ganges. After bathing in the holy
water, the brahmin men and women engage in worship by the riverside. As they close
their eyes, Nimai steals their food offerings and begins to eat them. A brahmin loses his
temper and says: "You scapegrace! You rascal! You are taking away my offering for
Vishnu. Ruin will seize you." Nimai holds on to the offering and is about to run away.
Many of the women love him dearly and cannot bear to have him go away. They call to
him: "Return, O Nimai! Come back, O Nimai!" Nimai turns a deaf ear to them.
One of the women, however, knows the irresistible charm that will bring him back. She
loudly chants the name of Hari. Immediately he repeats the name of Hari and comes
back.
M. was seated beside the Master. Sri Ramakrishna could not control himself. He cried
out, "Ah!" and shed tears of love. He said to Baburam and M.: "Don't make a fuss if I fall
into an ecstatic mood or go into samādhi. Then the worldly people will take me for a
cheat."
Another scene: Nimai is invested with the sacred thread of the brahmins. He puts on the
traditional ochre robe of the sannyasi. Mother Sachi and the women of the
neighbourhood stand about while he begs for alms, singing:
Drop a morsel of food, I pray, into my begging bowl;
Alone I roam, a new-made yogi, on the highways of the world.
People of Braja, you I love, and so, time and again,
I come to you; at hunger's call I beg my food from door to
door.
The sun is low, and I must seek my home on the Jamuna's bank;
Into its waters fall my tears, as onward murmuring it flows.
The onlookers leave the stage. Nimai stands alone. The gods, in the guise of brahmin
men and women, sing his praises.
Thy body gleams like liquid moonlight;
Thou hast put on man's dwarfish form.
O Lord, Thee we salute!
Men:
Women: Bewitcher of the gopis' hearts,
Thou roamest in the shady groves
About Vrindāvan's vale.
603Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
The youths of Braja are Thy friends;
Thou curbest haughty Madan's pride.
Women: Thy love has made the gopis mad;
In ecstasy the Jamuna thrills.
Men: Narayana, Deluder of demons!
Refuge of the fear-stricken gods!
Women: O Lover of Braja, Thou dost beg
The love of Braja's comely maidens!
Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
Listening to the music, the Master went into samādhi. The curtain fell and the orchestra
played on.
A new scene: Srivas and other devotees are engaged in conversation in front of
Advaita's house. Mukunda sings:
Sleep no more! How long will you lie
In māyā's slumber locked, O mind?
Who are you? Why have you been born?
Forgotten is your own true Self.
O mind, unclose your eyes at last
And wake yourself from evil dreams;
A fool you are to bind yourself
So to the passing shows of life,
When in you lives Eternal Bliss.
Come out of the gloom, O foolish mind!
Come out and hail the rising Sun!
Sri Ramakrishna praised the voice of the singer highly.
Another scene: Nimai is staying at home. Srivas comes to visit him. First he meets
Sachi. The mother weeps and says: "My son doesn't attend to his household duties. My
eldest son, Viswarupa, has renounced the world, and my heart has ached ever since.
Now I fear that Nimai will follow in his steps."
Nimai arrives. Sachi says to Srivas: "Look at him. Tears run down his cheeks and breast.
Tell, tell me how I can free him from these notions."
At the sight of Srivas, Nimai clings to his feet and says, with eyes full of tears: "Ah me!
Revered sir, I have not yet attained devotion to Krishna. Futile is this wretched life! Tell
me, sir, where is Krishna? Where shall I find Krishna? Give me the dust of your feet with
604your blessing, that I may realize the Blue One with the garland of wild-flowers hanging
about His neck."
Sri Ramakrishna looked at M. He was eager to say something but he could not. His voice
was choked with emotion; the tears ran down his cheeks; with unmoving eyes he
watched Nimai clinging to Srivas's feet and saying, "Sir, I have not yet attained devotion
to Krishna."
Nimai has opened a school, but he cannot teach the students any longer. Gangadas, his
former teacher, comes to persuade him to direct his attention to his worldly duties. He
says to Srivas: "Listen, Srivas! We are brahmins, too, and devoted to the worship of
Vishnu. But you people are ruining Nimai's worldly prospects."
MASTER (to M.): "That is the advice of the worldly-wise: Do 'this' as well as 'that'. When
the worldly man teaches spirituality he always advises a compromise between the world
and God."
M: "Yes, sir. That is true."
Gangadas continues his argument with Nimai. He says: "Nimai, undoubtedly you are
versed in the scriptures. Reason with me. Explain to me if any other duty is superior to
worldly duties. You are a householder. Why disregard the duties of a householder and
follow others' duties?"
MASTER (to M.): "Did you notice? He's trying to persuade Nimai to make a compromise."
M: "Yes, sir."
Nimai says to Gangadas: "I am not wilfully indifferent to a householder's duties. On the
contrary, it is my desire to hold to all sides. But, revered sir, I don't know what it is that
draws me on. I don't know what to do. I want to cling to the shore but I cannot. My soul
wanders away. I am helpless. My soul constantly wants to plunge headlong into the
boundless Ocean."
MASTER: "Ah me!"
The scene changes: Nityananda has arrived at Navadvip. After a search he meets Nimai,
who, in turn, has been seeking him. When they meet, Nimai says to him: "Blessed is my
life! Fulfilled is my dream! You visited me in a dream and then disappeared."
The Master said in a voice choked with emotion, "Nimai said he had seen him in a
dream."
Nimai is in an ecstatic mood and becomes engaged in conversation with Advaita, Srivas,
Haridas, and other devotees. Nitai sings a song suited to Nimai's mood:
605Where is Krishna? Where is my Krishna?
He is not in the grove, dear friends.
Give me Krishna! Bring me my Krishna!
Radha's heart knows naught but Him.
At this song Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. He remained in that state a long time.
The orchestra played on. Gradually his mind came down to the relative plane. In the
mean time a young man of Khardaha, born in the holy family of Nityananda, had entered
the box. He was standing behind the Master's chair. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with
delight at the sight of him. He held his hand and talked to him affectionately. Every now
and then he said: "Please sit down here. Your very presence awakens my spiritual
feeling." He played tenderly with the young man's hands and lovingly stroked his face.
After he had left, Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "He is a great scholar. His father is a great
devotee of God. When I go to Khardaha to visit Syamasundar, the father entertains me
with sacred offerings such as one cannot buy even for a hundred rupees. This young
man has good traits. A little shaking will awaken his inner spirit. At the sight of him my
spiritual mood is aroused. I should have been overwhelmed with ecstasy if he had stayed
here a little longer."
The curtain rises: Nityananda is walking in a procession on the public road with his
companions, chanting the name of Hari. He meets two ruffians, Jagai and Madhai, who
are sworn enemies of all religious people. Madhai strikes Nitai with a piece of broken
pottery. Nitai is hurt and bleeds profusely, but he pays no heed, inebriated as he is with
the love of God.
Sri Ramakrishna was in an ecstatic mood.
Nitai embraces both Jagai and Madhai, and sings a song to the two ruffians:
Jagai! Madhai! Oh, come and dance,
Chanting Hari's name with fervour!
What does it matter that you struck me?
Dance, dear friends, in Hari's name!
Sing the name of our Beloved:
He will embrace you in love's rapture!
Let the heavens resound with His name!
You have not tasted true emotion:
Weep as you chant the name of Hari,
And you will see the Moon of your soul.
Hari's name would I lovingly give you;
Nitai calls you to share His love.
Nimai speaks to Sachi of his desire to enter the monastic life. His mother faints and falls
to the ground.
606At this point many in the audience burst into tears. Sri Ramakrishna remained still and
looked intently at the stage. A single tear appeared in the corner of each eye. The
performance was over.
Sri Ramakrishna was about to enter a carriage. A devotee asked him how he had
enjoyed the play. The Master said with a smile, "I found the representation the same as
the real."
The carriage proceeded toward Mahendra's mill. Suddenly, Sri Ramakrishna went into an
ecstatic mood and murmured to himself in loving tones: "O Krishna! O Krishna! Krishna
is knowledge! Krishna is soul! Krishna is mind! Krishna is life! Krishna is body!" He
continued: "O Govinda, Thou art my life! Thou art my soul!"
The carriage reached the mill. Mahendra fed the Master tenderly with various dishes. M.
sat by his side. Affectionately he said to M., "Here, eat a little." He put some sweets in
his hands.
With Mahendra and a few other devotees, Sri Ramakrishna left in the carriage for the
Dakshineswar temple garden. The Master was in a happy mood. He sang a song about
Gaurānga and Nitai. M. sang with him:
Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers!
I have heard how kind you are,
And therefore I have come to you. . .
The Master and Mahendra talked about the latter's intended pilgrimage.
MASTER (smiling): "The divine love in you is barely a sprout now. Why should you let it
wither? But come back very soon. Many a time I have thought of visiting your place. At
last I have done it. I am so happy."
MAHENDRA: "My life is indeed blessed, sir."
MASTER: "You were already blessed. Your father is also a good man. I saw him the other
day. He has faith in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana."
MAHENDRA: "Please bless me that I may have love for God."
MASTER: "You are generous and artless. One cannot realize God without sincerity and
simplicity. God is far, far away from the crooked heart."
Near Syambazar, Mahendra bade the Master good-bye, and the carriage continued on its
way.

607Chapter 29
THE DURGA PUJA FESTIVAL
Friday, September 26, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA had come to Calcutta. It was the first day of the Durga Puja, the
great religious festival, and the Hindus of the metropolis were celebrating it. The Master
intended to visit the image of the Divine Mother at Adhar's house. He also wanted to see
Shivanath, the Brahmo devotee.
It was about midday. Umbrella in hand, M. was pacing the foot-path in front of the
Brahmo Samaj temple. Two hours had passed but the Master had not yet appeared. Now
and then M. sat down on the steps of Dr. Mahalnavish's dispensary and watched the joy
and mirth of the people, young and old, who were celebrating the Puja.
A little after three the Master's carriage drove up. As soon as Sri Ramakrishna stepped
out he saluted the temple of the Brahmo Samaj with folded hands. Hazra and a few
other devotees were with him. M. bowed before the Master and took the dust of his feet.
The Master told him that he was going to Shivanath's house. A few minutes later several
members of the Brahmo Samaj came and took him to Shivanath's. But Shivanath was
not at home. Shortly afterwards Vijay Goswami, Mahalnavish, and several other Brahmo
leaders greeted the Master and took him inside the Brahmo temple.
Sri Ramakrishna was in a happy mood. He was given a seat below the altar. There the
Brahmo devotees sang their devotional music. Vijay and the Brahmo devotees sat in
front of the Master.
MASTER (to Vijay, with a smile): "I was told that you had put up a 'signboard' here that
people belonging to other faiths are not allowed to come in. Narendra, too, said to me:
'You shouldn't go to the Brahmo Samiij. You had better visit Shivanath's house.'
Master's catholicity
"But I say that we are all calling on the same God. Jealousy and malice need not be.
Some say that God is formless,and some that God has form. I say, let one man meditate
on God with form if he believes in form, and let another meditate on the formless Deity if
he does not believe in form. What I mean is that dogmatism is not good. It is not good
to feel that my religion alone is true and other religions are false. The correct attitude is
this: My religion is right, but I do not know whether other religions are right or wrong,
true or false. I say this because one cannot know the true nature of God unless one
realizes Him. Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the Formless is my Father.
Which shall I blame? Which shall I praise? The two pans of the scales are equally heavy.'
Different paths for different temperaments
"Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Saktas, Saivas, Vaishnavas, the Brahmajnanis of the
time of the rishis, and you, the Brahmajnanis of modern times, all seek the same object.
A mother prepares dishes to suit the stomachs of her children. Suppose a mother has
608five children and a fish is bought for the family. She doesn't cook pilau or kalia for all of
them. All have not the same power of digestion; so she prepares a simple stew for
some. But she loves all her children equally.
"Do you know my attitude? I love all the preparations of fish. I have a womanly nature
(all laugh). I feel myself at home with every dish-fried fish, fish cooked with turmeric
powder, pickled fish. And further, I equally relish rich preparations like fish-head, kalia,
and pilau. (all laugh)
"Do you know what the truth is? God has made different religions to suit different
aspirants, times, and countries. All doctrines are only so many paths; but a path is by no
means God Himself. Indeed, one can reach God if one follows any of the paths with
whole-hearted devotion. Suppose there are errors in the religion that one has accepted;
if one is sincere and earnest, then God Himself will correct those errors. Suppose a man
has set out with a sincere desire to visit Jagannath at Puri and by mistake has gone
north instead of south; then certainly someone meeting him on the way will tell him: 'My
good fellow, don't go that way. Go to the south.' And the man will reach Jagannath
sooner or later.
"If there are errors in other religions, that is none of our business. God, to whom the
world belongs, takes care of that. Our duty is somehow to visit Jagannath. (To the
Brahmos) The view you hold is good indeed. You describe God as formless. That is fine.
One may eat a cake with icing, either straight or sidewise. It will taste sweet either way.
Dogmatism condemned
"But dogmatism is not good. You have no doubt heard the story of the chameleon. A
man entered a wood and saw a chameleon on a tree. He reported to his friends, 'I have
seen a red lizard.' He was firmly convinced that it was nothing but red. Another person,
after visiting the tree, said, 'I have seen a green lizard.' He was firmly convinced that it
was nothing but green. But the man who lived under the tree said: 'What both of you
have said is true. But the fact is that the creature is sometimes red, sometimes green,
sometimes yellow, and sometimes has no colour at all.'
"God has been described in the Vedas as both with attributes and without. You describe
Him as without form only. That is one-sided. But never mind. If you know one of His
aspects truly, you will be able to know His other aspects too. God Himself will tell you all
about them. (Pointing to two or three Brahmo devotees) Those who come to your Samaj
know both this gentleman and that."
Encouragement to Vijay
Vijay still belonged to the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. He was a salaried preacher of that
organization but could not obey all its rules and regulations. He mixed with those who
believed in God with form. This was creating a misunderstanding between him and the
Brahmo authorities. Many Brahmos disapproved of his conduct. The Master suddenly
looked at Vijay and began to talk to him.
MASTER (to Vijay, smiling): "I understand that they have been finding fault with you for
mixing with those who believe in God with form. Is that true? He who is a devotee of
609God must have an understanding that cannot be shaken under any conditions. He must
be like the anvil in a blacksmith's shop. It is constantly being struck by the hammer; still
it is unshaken. Bad people may abuse you very much and speak ill of you; but you must
bear with them all if you sincerely seek God. Isn't it possible to think of God in the midst
of the wicked? Just think of the rishis of ancient times. They used to meditate on God in
the forest, surrounded on all sides by tigers, bears, and other ferocious beasts. Wicked
men have the nature of tigers and bears. They will pursue you to do you an injury.
How to deal with wicked people
"One must be careful about these few things. First, an influential man who has much
money and many men under his control. He can injure you if he wants; you must be
careful while talking to him; perhaps you may have to approve what he says. Second, a
dog. When it chases you or barks at you, you must stand still, talk to it gently, and
pacify it. Third, a bull. If it runs after you with lowered horns, you must calm it with a
gentle voice. Fourth, a drunkard. If you arouse his anger, he will abuse you, naming
fourteen generations of your family. You should say to him: 'Hello uncle! How are you?'
Then he will be mightily pleased and sit by you and smoke.
"In the presence of a wicked person I become alert. If such a man asks me whether I
have a pipe for smoking, I say, 'Yes, I have.' Some people have the nature of a snake:
they will bite you without warning. You have to discriminate a great deal in order to
avoid the bite; otherwise your passion will be stirred up to such an extent that you will
feel like doing injury in return. The companionship of a holy man is greatly needed now
and then. It enables one to discriminate between the Real and the unreal."
VIJAY: "I have no time, sir. I am entangled in my duties here."
MASTER: "You are a religious teacher. Others have holidays, but not so a religious
teacher. When the manager of an estate brings order to one part of it, the landlord
sends him to another part. So you have no leisure." (all laugh)
VIJAY (with folded hands): "Sir, please give me your blessing."
MASTER: "Now you are talking like an ignorant person. It is God alone who blesses."
VIJAY: "Revered sir, please give us some instruction."
The Master glanced around the Brahmo temple and said with a smile, "This is nice too-a
mixture of crystals and syrup. There are crystals, and there is syrup too.
"I have scored too many points and am therefore out of the game (all laugh). Do you
know the game called 'nax'? It is a game of cards, and anyone scoring above seventeen
is out of the game. Those who score fewer points-say five, seven, or ten-are clever. I
have scored too many and am out of the game.
"Once Keshab Sen gave a lecture at his house. I was present. Many people were there.
The ladies were seated behind the screen. Keshab, in the course of his talk, said, 'O God,
610please bless us that we may dive and disappear altogether in the river of bhakti.' I said
to Keshab with a smile: 'If you disappear altogether in the river of bhakti, then what will
be the fate of those behind the screen? By all means dive into the river, but you had
better come back to dry land now and then: Don't disappear in the river altogether.' At
these words Keshab and the others burst out laughing.
"Never mind. One can realize God in the world, too, if only one is sincere. 'I' and 'mine'-
that is ignorance. But, 'O God! Thou and Thine'-that is knowledge.
Advice to householders
"Live in the world like a maidservant in a rich man's house. She performs all the
household duties, brings up her master's child, and speaks of him as 'my Hari'. But in
her heart she knows quite well that neither the house nor the child belongs to her. She
performs all her duties, but just the same her mind dwells on her native place. Likewise,
do your worldly duties but fix your mind on God. And know that house, family, and son
do not belong to you; they are God's. You are only His servant.
"I ask people to renounce mentally. I do not ask them to give up the world. If one lives
in the world unattached and seeks God with sincerity, then one is able to attain Him.
(To Vijay) "There was a time when I too would meditate on God with my eyes closed.
Then I said to myself: 'Does God exist only when I think of Him with my eyes closed?
Doesn't He exist when I look around with my eyes open?' Now, when I look around with
my eyes open, I see that God dwells in all beings. He is the Indwelling Spirit of all-men,
animals and other living beings, trees and plants, sun and moon, land and water.
"Why do I seek Shivanath? He who meditates on God for many days has substance in
him, has divine power in him. Further, he who sings well, plays well on a musical
instrument, or has mastered anyone art, has in him real substance and the power of
God. This is the view of the Gitā. It is said in the Chandi that he who is endowed with
physical beauty has in him substance and the power of God. (To Vijay) Ah, what a
beautiful nature Kedār has! No sooner does he come to me than he bursts into tears. His
eyes are always red and swim in tears, like a chanabara in syrup."
VIJAY: "At Dāccā he is constantly talking about you. He is always eager to see you."
Sri Ramakrishna was about to depart. The Brahmo devotees bowed low before him and
he returned their salute. Then, getting into the carriage, he set out for Adhar's house to
see the image of the Divine Mother.
Sunday, September 28, 1884
It was the day of the Mahāshtami, the most auspicious day of the worship of Durga, the
Divine Mother. At Adhar's invitation Sri Ramakrishna had come to Calcutta to see the
holy image at his house. Before going there he went to Ram's. Many devotees, including
Narendra, Baburam, M., Niranjan, Vijay, Kedār, Ram, and Surendra, were present.
Balarām and Rākhāl were still at Vrindāvan.
611MASTER (looking at Vijay and Kedār, with a smile): "This is a nice reunion today. You
two have the same spiritual mood. (To Vijay) Well, what about Shivanath? Did you-?"
VIJAY: "Yes, sir, he heard that you had been to his house. I haven't seen him, but I sent
him word. He knows about it."
MASTER (to Vijay and the others); "Four desires have come into my mind. I shall eat fish
curry cooked with egg-plant. I shall visit Shivanath. The devotees will repeat the name
of Hari over their beads, and I shall watch them. And the Tantrik devotees will drink
consecrated wine, eight ānnās worth, on the ashtami day, and I shall watch them and
salute them."
Narendra was seated in front of the Master. He was about twenty-two years old. While
Sri Ramakrishna was talking thus his eyes fell upon his beloved disciple. At once the
Master stood up and went into samādhi. He placed one foot on Narendra's knee. He was
in a deep spiritual mood, his eyes unblinking, his mind completely unconscious of the
outer world. After a long time he came down to the relative plane of consciousness; but
he still appeared dazed, for the intoxication of divine bliss had not altogether left him.
Speaking to himself in that ecstatic state, he repeated the name of God. He said:
"Satchidananda! Satchidananda! Satchidananda! Shall I repeat that? No, it is the day of
the Divine Mother, the Giver of the bliss of divine inebriation. O Mother, full of the bliss
of divine inebriation! Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni. It is not good to keep the voice on 'ni'.
It is not possible to keep it there very long. I shall keep it on the next lower note.
Difference between ordinary men and Incarnations
"There are different planes of consciousness: the gross, the subtle, the causal, and the
Great Cause. Entering the Mahakarana, the Great Cause, one becomes silent; one
cannot utter a word.
"But an Isvarakoti, after attaining the Great Cause, can come down again to the lower
planes. Incarnations of God, and others like them, belong to the class of the Isvarakotis.
They climb up, and they can also come down. They climb to the roof, and they can come
down again by the stairs and move about on a lower floor. It is a case of negation and
affirmation. There is, for instance, the seven-storey palace of a king. Strangers have
access only to the lower apartments; but the prince, who knows the palace to be his
own, can move up and down from floor to floor. There is a kind of rocket that throws out
sparks in one pattern and then seems to go out. After a moment it makes another
pattern, and then still another. There is no end to the patterns it can make. But there is
another kind of rocket that, when it is lighted, makes only a dull sound, throws out a few
sparks, and then goes out altogether. Like this second kind, an ordinary jiva, after much
spiritual effort, can go to a higher plane; but he cannot come down to tell others his
experiences. After much effort he may go into samādhi; but he cannot climb down from
that state or tell others what he has seen there.
Nature of the ever-perfect
"There is a class of devotees, the nityasiddhas, the ever-perfect. From their very birth
they seek God. They do not enjoy anything of the world.
612Illustration of homa bird
The Vedas speak of the homa bird. It lives very high in the sky. There the mother bird
lays her egg. She lives so high that the egg falls for many days. While falling it is
hatched. The chick continues to fall. That also goes on for many days. In the mean time
the chick develops eyes. Coming near the earth, it becomes conscious of the world. It
realizes it will meet certain death if it hits the ground. Then it gives a shrill cry and
shoots up toward its mother. The earth means death, and it frightens the young bird; it
then seeks its mother. She dwells high up in the sky, and the young bird shoots straight
up in that direction. It doesn't look anywhere else.
"Those who are born as the companions of an Incarnation of God are eternally perfect.
For some of them that birth is the last.
(To Vijay) "You have both-yoga and bhoga. King Janaka also had yoga and bhoga.
Therefore he is called a rajarshi, both king and seer. Nārada was a devarshi, and
Sukadeva a brahmarshi. Yes, Sukadeva was a brahmarshi. He was not a mere Jnāni; he
was the very embodiment of Jnāna, Divine Knowledge. Whom do I call a Jnāni? A man
who has attained Knowledge and has done so after much effort. Sukadeva was the very
image of Knowledge, in other words, a form of concentrated Knowledge. He attained
Knowledge spontaneously, without any labour."
Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna came down to the normal mood. Then he talked freely with
the devotees. The Master asked Kedār to sing.
Kedār sang:
How shall I open my heart, O friend?
It is forbidden me to speak.
I am about to die, for lack of a kindred soul
To understand my misery. . . .
Kedār sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees.
Nandalal, Keshab's nephew, was also present with a few brahmo friends. They were
sitting near the Master.
MASTER (to Vijay and the other devotees): "A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine
for me; but I couldn't even touch it."
VIJAY: "Ah!"
MASTER: "I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don't have to take any
wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita. I feel as if I had drunk five
bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about
food."
NARENDRA: "As regards food, one should take whatever comes."
613MASTER: "What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant's mind. No food
can harm a Jnāni.
According to the Gitā, the Jnāni himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the
Kundalini. But that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that
I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my
state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried
by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But
nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once
in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab's house.
They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn't know whether the food was handed to me
by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little (all laugh). Rākhāl had asked me to
eat.
(To Narendra) "With you it is all right. You are in 'this' as well as in 'that'. You can eat
everything now. (To the devotees) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he
eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on 'woman and gold', though he eats
the purest food-boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee.
"Once I had a desire to eat dal cooked in a blacksmith's house. From my childhood I had
heard the blacksmiths say, 'Do the brahmins know how to cook?' I ate the dal, but it
smelt of the blacksmith. (all laugh)
"I received the Allah mantra from Govinda Rai. Rice was cooked for me with onions in
the kuthi. I ate some. I ate curry in Mani Mallick's garden house, but I felt a kind of
repulsion to it.
"When I went to Kamarpukur, Ramlal's father was frightened. He thought I might eat at
any and every house. He was frightened to think I might be expelled from the caste; so I
couldn't stay long. I came away.
"Both the Vedas and the Puranas describe pure food and conduct. But what the Vedas
and the Puranas ask people to shun as impure is extolled by the Tantra as good.
Master's divine madness
"Oh, what a state of mind I passed through! I would open my mouth, touching, as it
were, heaven and the nether world with my jaws, and utter the word 'Ma'. I felt that I
had seized the Mother, like a fisherman dragging fish in his net. Let me recite a song:
This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kāli!
For I was born under an evil star,
And one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother.
Thou must devour me first, or I myself shall eat Thee up;
One or the other it must be.
I shall besmear my hands with black, and with black my face;
614With black I shall besmear the whole of my body
And when Death seizes me, with black I shall besmear his face.
O Mother, I shall eat Thee up but not digest Thee;
I shall install Thee in my heart
And make Thee offerings with my mind.
You may say that by eating Kāli I shall embroil myself
With Kala, Her Husband, but I am not afraid;
Braving His anger, I shall chant my Mother's name.
To show the world that Ramprasad is Kāli's rightful son,
Come what may, I shall eat Thee up-Thee and Thy retinue-
Or lose my life attempting it.
"I almost became mad-such was my longing for God."
Narendra began to sing:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .
Listening to the song, the Master again went into samādhi. Coming down to the normal
plane, he assumed the attitude of Girirani and sang the Āgamani . He sang, intoxicated
with divine love:
Tell me, my Uma, how have you fared, alone in the Stranger's house? . . .
He said to the devotees, "Today is the Mahashtami. The Mother has come; that is why I
feel such an awakening of spiritual emotion."
KEDĀR: "Lord, you are here. Are you different from the Divine Mother?"
Sri Ramakrishna looked in another direction and sang in an absent-minded mood:
Ah, friend! I have not found Him yet, whose love has driven me mad....
Again he became ecstatic and sang of the Divine Mother. As he sang, Vijay suddenly
stood up crying the name of Hari. Sri Ramakrishna, full of divine love, began to dance
with Vijay and the other devotees.
The music was over. The Master, Vijay, Narendra, and the other devotees sat down. All
eyes were fixed on Sri Ramakrishna, who began conversing with the devotees. He asked
about their health. Kedār spoke to him humbly in a soft, sweet voice. Narendra, Chunilal,
Ram, M., and Harish were sitting by the Master.
KEDĀR (humbly): "How can I get rid of my dizziness?"
MASTER (tenderly): "One gets that. I have had it myself.
615Use a little almond oil. I have heard that it cures dizziness."
KEDĀR: "I shall, sir."
MASTER (to Chunilal): "Hello! How is everything?"
CHUNILAL: "Everything is all right with us now. Balarām Babu and Rākhāl are well at
Vrindāvan."
MASTER: "Why have you sent so many sweetmeats? (To Harish) Wait a day or two
before coming to Dakshineswar. You are not well. You may fall ill again there. (To
Narayan, tenderly) Sit here. Sit by me. Come to Dakshineswar tomorrow and have your
meal there. (Pointing to M.) Come with him. (To M.) What do you say?"
M. wanted to accompany Sri Ramakrishna to Dakshineswar that very day. He became
thoughtful.
Surendra stood near Sri Ramakrishna. He was in the habit of drinking and often went to
excess. This had worried the Master greatly, but he had not asked Surendra to give up
drinking altogether. He had said to him: "Look here, Surendra! Whenever you drink
wine, offer it beforehand to the Divine Mother. See that your brain doesnt become
clouded and that you don't reel The more you think of the Divine Mother, the less you
will like to drink The Mother is the Giver of the bliss of divine inebriation. Realizing Her,
one feels a natural bliss."
The Master looked at Surendra and said, "You have had a drink." With these words he
went into samādhi. It was dusk. Regaining partial consciousness, the Master sang:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!
Drunk with a draught of celestial wine, She reels, and yet She
does not fall. . .
Then he chanted the name of Hari, clapping his hands occasionally. In a sweet voice he
said: "Hari! Hari! O mind, chant the name of Hari! Sing the name of Hari!" Then he
chanted: "Rāma! Rāma Rāma! Rāma!"
Now the Master began to pray: "O Rāma! O Rāma! I am without devotion and austerity,
without knowledge and love; I have not performed any religious rites. O Rāma, I have
taken refuge in Thee; I have taken shelter at Thy feet. I do not want creature comforts;
I do not seek name and fame. O Rāma, I do not crave the eight occult powers; I do not
care for a hundred occult powers! I am Thy servant. I have taken refuge in Thee. Grant,
O Rāma, that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet; that I may not be deluded by Thy
world-bewitching māyā! O Rāma, I have taken refuge it Thee."
As the Master prayed all eyes were turned toward him. Hearing his piteous voice, few
could restrain their tears.
616Ramchandra Dutta came in and stood near him.
MASTER: "Where have you been, Ram?"
RAM: "I was upstairs, sir."
Ram had been making arrangements for feeding the devotees on the roof of the house.
MASTER (to Ram, with a smile): "Isn't it better to stay down below that to be high up?
Water accumulates in low land but flows down from a high mound."
RAM (with a smile): "That is true, sir."
Supper was ready on the roof. Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees were taken there and
sumptuously fed. Later the Master went to Adhar's house with M., Niranjan, and others.
The Divine Mother was being worshipped there, It had been Adhar's earnest prayer that
on this sacred day Sri Ramakrishna might bless his house with his presence.
Monday, September 29, 1884
It was the third day of the Durga Puja. The Master had been awake in his room at
Dakshineswar since early morning. The morning worship in the Kāli temple was over and
the orchestra had played the morning melodies in the nahabat. Brahmans and
gardeners, basket in hand, were plucking flowers for the worship of the Divine Mother.
Bhavanath, Baburam, Niranjan, and M. had spent the night at Dakshineswar, sleeping on
the porch of the Master's room. As soon as they awoke they saw Sri Ramakrishna
dancing in an ecstatic mood. He was chanting: "Victory to Mother Durga! Hallowed be
the name of Durga!" He was naked and looked like a child as he chanted the name of the
Blissful Mother. After a few moments he said: "Oh, the bliss of divine ecstasy! Oh, the
bliss of divine drunkenness!" Then he repeatedly chanted the name of Govinda: "O
Govinda! My life! My soul!"
The devotees sat on their beds and with unwinking eyes watched Sri Ramakrishna's
spiritual mood. Hazra was living at the temple garden. Lātu was also living there to
render the Master personal service. Rākhāl was still at Vrindāvan. Narendra visited Sri
Ramakrishna now and then. He was expected that day.
The devotees washed their faces. The Master took his seat on a mat on the north
verandah. Bhavanath and M. sat beside him. Other devotees were coming in and out of
the room.
MASTER (to Bhavanath): "The truth is that ordinary men cannot easily have faith. But an
Isvarakoti's faith is spontaneous. Prahlada burst into tears while writing the letter 'ka'. It
reminded him of Krishna. It is the nature of jivas to doubt. They say yes, no doubt, but-
Oneness of Śakti and Brahman
"Hazra can never be persuaded to believe that Brahman and Śakti, that Śakti and the
Being endowed with Śakti, are one and the same. When the Reality appears as Creator,
617Preserver, and Destroyer, we call It Śakti; when It is inactive, we call It Brahman. But
really It is one and the same thing-indivisible. Fire naturally brings to mind its power to
burn; and the idea of burning naturally brings to mind the idea of fire. It is impossible to
think of the one without the other.
"So I prayed to the Divine Mother: 'O Mother! Hazra is trying to upset the views of this
place. Either give him right understanding or take him from here.' The next day he carne
to me and said, 'Yes, I agree with you.' He said that God exists everywhere as All-
pervading Consciousness."
BHAVANATH (smiling): "Did what Hazra said really make you suffer so much?"
MASTER: "You see, I am now in a different mood. I can't shout and carry on heated
discussions with people. I am not in a mood now to argue and quarrel with Hazra. Hriday
said to me at Jadu Mallick's garden house, 'Uncle, don't you want to keep me with you?'
'No,' I said, 'I am no longer in a mood to get into heated arguments with you.'
Knowledge and ignorance
"What is knowledge and what is ignorance? A man is ignorant so long as he feels that
God is far away. He has knowledge when he knows that God is here and everywhere.
Childlike faith
"When a man has true knowledge he feels that everything is filled with Consciousness.
At Kamarpukur I used to talk to Shibu, who was then a lad four or five years old. When
the clouds rumbled and lightning flashed, Shibu would say to me: 'There, uncle! They
are striking matches again!' (all laugh) One day I noticed him chasing grasshoppers by
himself. The leaves rustled in the near-by trees. 'Hush! Hush!' he said to the leaves. 'I
want to catch the grasshoppers.' He was a child and saw everything throbbing with
consciousness. One cannot realize God without the faith that knows no guile, the simple
faith of a child.
"Ah, what a state of mind I passed through! One day something bit me while I was
sitting in the grass. I was afraid it might have been a snake, and I didn't know what to
do. I had heard that if a snake bites you again immediately after its first bite, it takes
back. its own venom. At once I set out to discover the hole so that I might let the snake
bite me again. While I was searching, a man said to me, 'What are you doing?' After
listening to my story, he said, 'But the snake must bite in the very same place it has
bitten before.' Thereupon I went away. Perhaps I had been bitten by a scorpion or some
other insect.
"I had heard from Ramlal that the autumn chill was good for one's health. Ramlal had
quoted a verse to support it. One day, as I was returning from Calcutta in a carriage, I
stuck my head out of the window so that I might get all the chill. Then I fell ill." (all
laugh)
618Sri Ramakrishna entered his room and sat down. His legs were a little swollen. He asked
the devotees to feel his legs and see whether or not the pressure of their fingers made
dimples. Dimples did appear with the pressure, but the devotees said that it was
nothing.
MASTER (to Bhavanath): "Please ask Mahendra of Sinthi to see me. I shall feel better if
he reassures me."
BHAVANATH (with a smile): "You have great faith in medicine. But we haven't so much."
MASTER: "It is God who, as the doctor, prescribes the medicine. It is He who, in one
form, has become the physician. Dr. Gangaprasad asked me not to drink water at night.
I regarded his statement as the words of the Vedas. I look upon him as the physician of
heaven."
Hazra entered the room and sat down. The Master talked awhile about different things
and then said to Hazra: "You see, many people were at Ram's house yesterday. Vijay,
Kedār, and others were there. But why did I feel so deeply stirred at the sight of
Narendra? I found that Kedār belonged to the realm of Divine Inebriation."
Presently Narendra arrived, and Sri Ramakrishna was exceedingly happy. Narendra
saluted the Master and began to talk with Bhavanath and others in the room. M. was
seated near by. A long mat was spread on the floor. While talking, Narendra lay on it flat
on his stomach. The Master looked at him and suddenly went into samādhi. He sat on
Narendra's back in an ecstatic mood.
Bhavanath sang:
O Mother, ever blissful as Thou art,
Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! . . .
Sri Ramakrishna came down from the plane of samādhi. He sang:
Repeat, O mind, my Mother Durga's hallowed name!
O Gauri! O Narayani! to Thee I bow.
Thou art the day, O Mother! Thou art the dusk and the night.
As Rāma Thou drawest the bow, as Krishna Thou playest the
flute;
As Kāli all-terrible, Thou hast silenced Śiva, Thy Lord.
The ten Embodiments of Divine Śakti art Thou,
And Thou the ten Avatars; this time save me Thou must!
With flowers and vilwa-leaves did Yaśoda worship Thee,
And Thou didst bless her by placing Krishna, the Child, in her
arms.
Wherever I chance to live, O Mother, in forest or grove,
May my mind, day and night, dwell at Thy Lotus Feet;
Whether at last I die a natural or sudden death,
Oh, may my tongue repeat Durga's name at the end!
619Thou mayest send me away, O Mother, but where shall I go?
Tell me, Mother, where else shall I hear so sweet a name?
Thou mayest even say to me: "Step aside! Go away!"
Yet I shall cling to Thee, O Durga! Unto Thy feet
As Thine anklets I shall cling, making their tinkling sound.
When, O Mother, Thou sittest at mighty Śiva's side,
Then I shall cry from Thy feet, "Victory unto Śiva!"
Mother, when as the Kite, Thou soarest in the sky,
There, in the water beneath, as a minnow I shall be swimming;
Upon me Thou wilt pounce, and pierce me through with Thy
claws.
Thus, when the breath of life forsakes me in Thy grip,
Do not deny me the shelter of Thy Lotus Feet!
From the world's bondage free me, 0 Spouse of the Absolute!
Thy two feet are my boat to cross this world's dark sea.
Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world;
From Thee have the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Brahma
sprung.
Whoever treads the path, repeating "Durga! Durga!"
Śiva Himself protects with His almighty trident.
Hazra was sitting on the northeast verandah counting the beads of his rosary. The
Master went and sat in front of him, taking the rosary in his own hands.
MASTER (to Hazra): "You see, I cannot use the rosary. No, perhaps I can. Yes, I can
with my left hand. But I cannot repeat the name of God with it."
With these words Sri Ramakrishna tried to perform a little japa. But hardly had he begun
when he went into samādhi. He sat in that state a long time, still holding the rosary in
his hand. The devotees looked at him with wonder in their eyes. Hazra also watched the
Master without uttering a word. After a long time Sri Ramakrishna regained
consciousness of the outer world and said that he was hungry. He often said such things
to bring his mind down to the normal plane. M. was going to bring something for him to
eat. The Master said, "No, I shall first go to the Kāli temple."
He went across the cement courtyard toward the Kāli temple. On the way he bowed with
folded hands to the twelve Śiva temples. On the left was the temple of Radhakanta. He
went there first and bowed before the image. Then he entered the Kāli temple and
saluted the Mother. Sitting on a carpet, he offered flowers at the Mother's holy feet. He
also placed a flower on his own head. While returning from the temple he asked
Bhavanath to carry the green coconut offered at the temple, and the charanamrita.
Coming back to his room, accompanied by M. and Bhavanath, he saluted Hazra, who
cried out in dismay: "What are you doing, sir? What is this?" The Master said, "Why
should you say it is wrong?" Hazra often argued with the Master, declaring that God
dwelt in all beings and that everybody could attain Brahmajnana through sadhana. He
had an exaggerated idea of his own spiritual progress.
620It was about noon. The gong and the bells announced the worship and offering in the
various temples. The brahmins, the Vaishnavas, and the beggars went to the guest-
house to have their midday meal. The devotees of the Master were also to partake of the
sacred offerings. He asked them to go to the guest-house. To Narendra he said: "Won't
you take your meal in my room? All right. Narendra and I will eat here." Bhavanath,
Baburam, M., and the other devotees went to the guest-house.
After his meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a few minutes. The devotees were on the
verandah engaged in light conversation. He soon joined them and was happy in their
company. It was about two o'clock. All were, still sitting on the verandah, when suddenly
Bhavanath appeared in the garb of a brahmachari, dressed in an ochre cloth, kamandalu
in hand, his face beaming with smiles.
MASTER (with a smile): "That is his inner feeling. Therefore he has dressed himself as a
brahmachari"
NARENDRA: "He has put on the garb of a brahmachari; let me put on the garb of' a
Tantrik worshipper."
HAZRA: "Then you will have to follow the Tantrik rituals, with women, wine, and so on."
Sri Ramakrishna did not encourage the conversation. Indeed, he made fun of it.
Suddenly the Master began to dance in an ecstatic mood. He sang:
Mother, Thou canst not trick me any more,
For I have seen Thy crimson Lotus Feet. . . .
The Master said: "Ah, how wonderfully Rajnarayan sings about the Divine Mother! He
sings and dances that way. The music of Nakur Āchārya at Kamarpukur is also
wonderful. Ah, how beautiful his singing and dancing are!"
A sādhu was staying at the Panchavati. But he was a hot-tempered man; he scolded and
cursed everyone. He came to the Master's room wearing wooden sandals and asked the
Master, "Can I get fire here?" Sri Ramakrishna saluted him and stood with folded hands
as long as he remained in the room.
When he had left, Bhavanath said to the Master with a laugh, "What great respect you
showed the sādhu!"
MASTER (smiling): "You see, he too is Narayana, though full of tamas. This is the way
one should please people who have an excess of tamas. Besides, he is a sādhu."
The devotees were engaged in a game of golokdham. Hazra joined them. The Master
stood by, watching them play. M. and Kishori reached "heaven". Sri Ramakrishna bowed
before them and said, "Blessed are you two brothers." He said to M., aside, "Don't play
any more." Hazra fell into "hell". The Master said: "What's the matter with Hazra?
621Again!" No sooner had Hazra got out of "hell" than he fell into it again. All burst into
laughter. Lātu, at the first throw of the dice, went to "heaven" from "earth". He began to
cut capers of joy. "See Lātu's joy!" said the Master. "He would have been terribly sad if
he hadn't achieved this. (Aside to the devotees) This too has a meaning. Hazra is so vain
that he thinks he will triumph over all even in this game. This is the law of God, that He
never humiliates a righteous person. Such a man is victorious everywhere."
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his room. Narendra, Baburam,
Bhavanath, and M. were sitting on the floor. Narendra referred to various religious sects-
the Ghoshpara, Panchanami, and others. Sri Ramakrishna described their views and
condemned their immoral practices. He said that they could not follow the right course of
spiritual discipline, but enjoyed sensuous pleasures in the name of religion.
Danger of Tantrik discipline
MASTER (to Narendra): "You need not listen to these things. The bhairavas and the
bhairavis of the Tantrik sect also follow this kind of discipline. While in Benares I was
taken to one of their mystic circles. Each bhairava had a bhairavi with him. I was asked
to drink the consecrated wine, but I said I couldn't touch wine. They drank it. I thought
perhaps they would then practise meditation and japa. But nothing of the sort. They
began to dance. I was afraid they might fall into the Ganges: the circle had been made
on its bank. It is very honourable for husband and wife to assume the roles of bhairava
and bhairavi.
(To Narendra and the others) "Let me tell you this. I regard woman as my mother; I
regard myself as her son. This is a very pure attitude. There is no danger in it. To look
on woman as a sister is also not bad. But to assume the attitude of a 'hero', to look on
woman as one's mistress, is the most difficult discipline. Tārak's father followed this
discipline. It is very difficult. In this form of sadhana one cannot always maintain the
right attitude.
"There are various paths to reach God. Each view is a path. It is like reaching the Kāli
temple by different roads. But it must be said that some paths are clean and some dirty.
It is good to travel on a clean path.
"Many views, many paths-and I have seen them all. But I don't enjoy them any more;
they all quarrel.
Master's inner experiences
"No one else is here, and you are my own people. Let me tell you something. I have
come to the final realization that God is the Whole and I am a part of Him, that God is
the Master and I am His servant. Furthermore, I think every now and then that He is I
and I am He."
The devotees listened to these words in deep silence.
622BHAVANATH (humbly): "I feel disturbed if I have a misunderstanding with someone. I
feel that in that case I am not able to love all"
MASTER: "Try at the outset to talk to him and establish a friendly relationship with him.
If you fail in spite of your efforts, then don't give it another thought. Take refuge in God.
Meditate on Him. There is no use in giving up God and feeling depressed from thinking
about others."
BHAVANATH: "Great souls, such as Christ and Chaitanya, have admonished us to love all
beings."
MASTER: "Love you must, because God dwells in all beings. But salute a wicked person
from a distance. You speak of Chaitanya? He also used to restrain his spiritual feeling in
the presence of unsympathetic people. At Srivas's house he put Srivas's mother-in-law
out of the room, dragging her out by the hair."
BHAVANATH: "It was not he but others who did it."
MASTER: "Could the other have done it
Suppose a man cannot make another love
Must I waste my mind, which should be
Mother, I don't want Narendra, Bhavanath,
shall I do with man?'
without his approval? What can be done?
him; must he worry about it day and night?
given to God, on useless things? I say: 'O
Rākhāl, or anybody. I seek Thee alone. What
When the Blissful Mother comes to my house, how much of the Chandi I shall hear!
How many monks will come here, and how many yogis with matted locks!
"When I attain God I shall attain everything. I renounced gold and silver, saying, 'Rupee
is clay and clay is rupee; gold is clay and clay is gold.' With these words I threw gold,
silver, and clay into the Ganges. Then I was afraid at the thought that Mother Lakshmi
might be angry with me because I had treated Her wealth with contempt; that She
might even stop my meals. So I prayed to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, I want Thee
and nothing else.' I knew that by realizing Her I should get everything."
BHAVANATH (smiling): "This is the shrewd calculation of a business man."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, that is so. Once the Lord was pleased with a certain devotee.
He appeared before him and said: 'I am very much pleased with your austerities. Ask a
boon of Me.' The devotee said, 'O Lord, if You are gracious enough to give me a boon,
then please grant that I may eat from gold plates with my grandchildren.' One boon
covered many things-wealth, children, and grandchildren." (all laugh)
Hazra was sitting on the verandah.
623MASTER: "Do you know what Hazra wants? He wants money. His family is in distress; he
has debts. He thinks that God will give him money because he devotes himself to japa
and meditation."
A DEVOTEE: "Can't God fulfil a devotee's desire?"
MASTER: "If it is His sweet will. But God doesn't take entire responsibility for a devotee
unless the devotee is completely intoxicated with ecstatic love for Him. At a feast it is
only a child whom one takes by the hand and seats at his place. Who does that with
older people? Not until a man thinks so much of God that he cannot look after himself
does God take on his responsibilities. Hazra doesn't inquire about his family. His son said
to Ramlal: 'Please ask father to come home. We shall not ask anything of him.' These
words almost brought tears to my eyes. Hazra's mother said to Ramlal: 'Please ask
Pratap to come home just once. Also ask your uncle to request him to come home.' I
told him about it, but he didn't listen to me.
Duty toward mother
"Is a mother to be trifled .with? Before becoming a sannyasi Chaitanyadeva worked hard
to persuade his mother to let him renounce home. Mother Sachi said that she would kill
Keshab Bharati. Chaitanyadeva did his utmost to persuade her. He said: 'Mother, I shall
not renounce home if you won't let me. But if you compel me to lead a householder's
life, I shall die. And, mother, even if I go away as a sannyasi, you will be able to see me
whenever you desire. I shall stay near you. I shall see you every now and then.' Only
when Chaitanya explained it to her thus did she give her permission. Nārada could not
go to the forest to practise austerity as long as his mother was alive. He had to take care
of her. After her death he went away to realize God.
"When I went to Vrindāvan I felt no desire to return to Calcutta. It was arranged that I
should live with Gangama. Everything was settled. My bed was to be on one side and
Gangama's on the other. I resolved not to go back to Calcutta. I said to myself, 'How
long must I eat a kaivarta's food?' 'No,' said Hriday to me, 'let us go to Calcutta.' He
pulled me by one hand and Gangama pulled me by the other. I felt an intense desire to
live at Vrindāvan. But just then I remembered my mother. That completely changed
everything. She was old. I said to myself: 'My devotion to God will take to its wings if I
have to worry about my mother. I would rather live with her. Then I shall have peace of
mind and be able to meditate on God.'
(To Narendra) "Why don't you say a few words to Hazra about going home? The other
day he said to me, 'Yes, I shall go home and stay there three days.' But now he has
forgotten all about it.
(To the devotees) "We have talked about filthy things-Ghoshpara and things like that.
Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Now chant the name of Hari. Let there be a dish of rice
pudding and sweets after the ordinary lentils."
Narendra began to sing:
624Fasten your mind, O man, on the Primal Purusha,
Who is the Cause of all causes,
The Stainless One, the Beginningless Truth.
As Prana He pervades the infinite universe;
The man of faith beholds Him,
Living, resplendent, the Root of all.
Beyond the senses, eternal, the Essence of Consciousness,
He shines in the cave of the heart,
Adorned with Holiness, Wisdom, and Love;
By meditating on Him, man is delivered from grief.
Of countenance ever serene,
An inexhaustible Ocean of Virtue,
None can fathom His depths; yet freely, of His own grace,
Does He reveal Himself
To those who come to His feet for shelter,
Merciful since they are helpless and He is the Ever-forgiving,
The Giver of happiness,
The Ready Help in the sea of our woe.
Unswervingly just, bestowing the fruits of our deeds, good and
ill,
Yet is He the Fount of Compassion,
The Ocean of Mercy brimming with Love;
Even to hear of His glory suffuses the eyes with tears.
Gaze on His face and be blest:
Your heart is hungry for Him, O man!
Bright with unspeakable beauty, peerless and without stain,
No words can ever describe Him;
Be as a beggar before His gate
And worship Him day and night, beseeching Him for His
grace.
He sang again:
In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full,
And Love's Hood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.
O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee!
On every side shine devotees, like stars around the moon;
Their Friend, the Lord All-merciful, joyously plays with them.
Behold! the gates of paradise today are open wide. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna was dancing in a circle. The devotees joined him. They all sang and
danced. Their bliss was indescribable. The Master sang about the Divine Mother:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!...
625Sri Ramakrishna was highly pleased because M. had joined in the music. He said to M.,
with a smile, "The atmosphere would have been more intense with divine fervour if a
drum had accompanied the music and played: 'Tak tak ta dhina! Dak dak da dhina!' "
It was dusk when the kirtan was finished.
Wednesday, October 1, 1884
Master at Adhar's house
Sri Ramakrishna had set out from Dakshineswar for Adhar's house in Calcutta. Narayan
and Gangadhar were with him. In the carriage, in an ecstatic mood, he said: "Shall I
count the beads? How shameful that would be! This emblem of Śiva has sprung from the
bowels of the earth; it is self created and not set up by man's hands."
They arrived at Adhar's house, where many devotees, including Kedār, Baburam, and
Vijay, had assembled. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, was present. At the Master's
behest, Adhar heard Vaishnavcharan's music daily after his return from the office.
When the Master entered Adhar's drawing-room the devotees stood up to receive him.
Kedār and Vijay saluted him, and the Master asked Narayan and Baburam to salute
Kedār and Vijay. He asked Kedār and Vijay to bless Narayan and Baburam that they
might have devotion to God. Pointing to Narayan he said, "He is utterly guileless." The
eyes of the devotees were fixed on the two boys.
MASTER (to Kedār and the other devotees): "It is good that I have met you all here;
otherwise perhaps you would have come to the Kāli temple to see me. Through the will
of God, however, we have met here."
KEDĀR (with folded hands): "The will of God! It is all your will."
Sri Ramakrishna smiled. Vaishnavcharan began a kirtan about Radha and Krishna. When
the music was nearing its end, with the union of Radha and Krishna, the Master began to
dance with ecstatic fervour. The devotees danced and sang around him. After the music
they all sat down. The Master said to Vijay, referring to Vaishnavcharan, "He sings very
well." He asked the musician to sing the song about Sri Chaitanya, beginning with the
line, "The beautiful Gaurānga, the youthful dancer, fair as molten gold."
When the song was over, the Master asked Vijay, "How did you like it?"
VIJAY: "Wonderful."
Sri Ramakrishna also sang a song about Sri Chaitanya, M. joining him. Then
Vaishnavcharan sang another song:
O my flute, sing Hari's name!
You cannot know the highest Truth
Without Lord Hari's grace.
626His name removes our bitter grief:
Repeat the name of Hari, then,
Repeat Sri Krishna's holy name!
If He bestows His grace on me,
No longer shall be afraid
Of this unfriendly world;
Sing then Lord Hari's name, my flute!
Our only treasure is His name.
Govinda says: Behold, my days
Are passing by in vain:
In the world's deep and shoreless sea,
Oh, let me not be drowned!
Vaishnavcharan sang again, this time about Mother Durga:
O tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga;
Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress? . . .
The Master and the musician sang again and again the following lines from the song:
The moving and the unmoving, the gross and the subtle, art
Thou:
Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution.
Thou art the Primal Root of this manifold universe:
The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou;
Thou art the Śakti of all, and Thou Thine own Śakti, too.
Kedār and several devotees stood up. They were about to return home. Kedār saluted
the Master and bade him good-bye.
MASTER: "Should you go away without bidding Adhar good-bye? Wouldn't that be an act
of discourtesy?"
KEDĀR: "'When God is pleased, the world is pleased.' You are staying; so in a sense we
are all staying. I am not feeling well. Besides, I am a little nervous about my social
conventions. Once before I had trouble with our community."
VIJAY: (pointing to the Master): "Should we go away and leave him here?"
Just then Adhar came in to take the Master to the dining-room, for the meal was ready.
Sri Ramakrishna stood up and said, addressing Kedār and Vijay: "Come. Come with me."
They followed him and partook of the dinner together with the other devotees.
After dinner they all returned to the drawing-room, where the devotees sat around the
Master. Kedār said to him with folded hands, 'Please forgive me for hesitating to eat
here.' Perhaps the thought had come to his mind that he should not have hesitated,
since the Master himself had no scruples about eating at Adhar's house.
627Kedār worked at Dāccā. Many devotees brought offerings of sweets and other food for
him. Referring to this, Kedār said to the Master: "People want to give me food. What
should I do? Lord, what is your command in this matter?"
MASTER: "One can eat food even from an untouchable if the untouchable is a devotee of
God. After spending seven years in a God-intoxicated state at Dakshineswar, I visited
Kamarpukur. Oh, what a state of mind I was in at that time! Even a prostitute fed me
with her own hands. But I cannot allow that now."
Kedār was about to take his leave.
KEDĀR (in a low voice): "Lord, please transmit power to me. Many people come to me.
What do I know?"
MASTER: "Everything will be all right. One gets along well if one is sincerely devoted to
God."
Yogendra, the editor of a Bengali paper, the Bangavasi, entered the room. The
conversation turned to the Personal God and God without form.
MASTER: "God has form; again, He is formless. How many aspects He has! We cannot
comprehend Him. Why should we say that God is formless only?"
YOGENDRA: "That is the one amazing thing about the Brahmo Samaj. There even a boy
twelve years old sees God as formless. The members of the Adi Samaj do not object
very much to God with form. They are allowed to attend ritualistic worship if it takes
place in respectable families."
MASTER (smiling): "How nicely he has put it! Even a boy sees the formless God!"
ADHAR: "Shivanath Babu does not believe in God's forms."
VIJAY: "That is his mistake. (Pointing to the Master) As he says, the chameleon assumes
different colours-now this colour, now that. Only the man who lives under the tree knows
the animal's true colour.
"While meditating I saw images of gods painted on a canvas. How many gods! How
many different things they said! I said to myself: 'I shall go to the Master. He will explain
it all to me.' "
MASTER: "You saw correctly."
KEDĀR: "God assumes forms for the sake of His devotees. Through ecstatic love a
devotee sees God with form. Dhruva had a vision of the Lord. He said: 'Why don't your
ear-rings move?' The Lord said, 'They will move if you move them.' "
628MASTER: "One must accept everything: God with form and God without form. While
meditating in the Kāli temple I noticed Ramani, a prostitute. I said, 'Mother, I see that
Thou art in that form too.' Therefore I say one must accept everything. One does not
know when or how God will reveal Himself."
The Master sang:
A mendicant has come to us, ever absorbed in divine moods. . .
VIJAY: "God has infinite power. Can He not reveal Himself in any form He chooses? Man
is a speck of dust, and he dares come to a conclusion about God. How amazing!"
MASTER: "A man reads a little of the Gitā, the Bhagavata, or the Vedānta and thinks he
has understood everything. Once an ant went to a hill of sugar. One grain of sugar filled
its stomach, and it was returning home with another grain in its mouth. On the way it
said to itself, 'The next time I go, I shall bring home the whole hill.' "(All laugh)

629Chapter 30
THE MASTER IN VARIOUS MOODS
Thursday, October 2, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar. Lātu, Ramlal, Harish, and
Hazra were living with him at the temple garden. Baburam spent a day or two with him
now and then.
Manilal Mallick, Priya Mukherji and his relative Hari, a bearded Brahmo devotee from
Shibpur, and several Mārwāri devotees from Calcutta were in the Master's room. Manilal
was an old member of the Brahmo Samaj.
MASTER (to Manilal and the others): "It is wise to salute a person mentally. What need
is there of touching his feet? Mental salutation doesn't embarrass anybody.
"The attitude that my religion alone is right and all other religions are false is not good. I
see that God Himself has become all these: men; images, and salagram. I see one alone
in all these; I do not see two. I see only one.
"Many people think that their opinion alone is right and others' opinions are wrong; that
they alone have won and others have lost. But a person who has gone forward may be
detained by some slight obstacle, and someone who has been lagging behind may then
steal a march on him. In the game of golokdham one may advance a great deal, but still
somehow one's piece may fail to reach the goal.
Inscrutability of God's ways
"Triumph or defeat is in the hands of God. We cannot understand His ways. You must
have noticed that the green coconut remains high in the tree and is exposed to the sun,
but still its milk is cool. On the other hand the paniphal remains in the water, but when
eaten it heats the body.
"Look at the body of man. The head is the root, and it is at the top."
Two ways of Yoga
MANILAL: "What then is our duty?"
MASTER: "To remain somehow united with God. There are two ways: karmayoga and
manoyoga. Householders practise yoga through karma, the performance of duty.
There are four stages of life: brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanaprastha, and sannyās.
Sannyāsis must renounce those karmas which are performed with special ends in view;
but they should perform the daily obligatory karmas, giving up all desire for results.
Sannyāsis are united with God by such karmas as the acceptance of the staff, the
receiving of alms, going on pilgrimage, and the performance of worship and japa.
630"It doesn't matter what kind of action you are engaged in. You can be united with God
through any action provided that, performing it, you give up all desire for its result.
"There is the other path: manoyoga. A yogi practising this discipline doesn't show any
outward sign. He is inwardly united with God. Take Jadabharata and Sukadeva, for
instance. There are many other yogis of this class, but these two are well known. They
shave neither hair nor beard.
"All actions drop away when a man reaches the stage of the paramahamsa. He always
remembers the ideal and meditates on it. He is always united with God in his mind. If he
ever performs an action it is to teach men.
"A man may be united with God either through action or through inwardness of thought,
but he can know everything through bhakti. Through bhakti one spontaneously
experiences kumbhaka. The nerve currents and breathing calm down when the mind is
concentrated. Again, the mind is concentrated when the nerve currents and breathing
calm down. Then the buddhi, the discriminating power, becomes steady. The man who
achieves this state is not himself aware of it.
Efficacy of bhakti-yoga
"One can attain everything through bhakti yoga. I wept before the Mother and prayed,
'O Mother, please tell me, please reveal to me, what the yogis have realized through
yoga and the jnanis through discrimination.' And the Mother has revealed everything to
me. She reveals everything if the devotee cries to Her with a yearning heart. She has
shown me everything that is in the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Puranas, and the Tantra."
MANILAL: "And what about hathayoga?"
MASTER: "The hathayogis identify themselves with their bodies. They practise internal
washing and similar disciplines, and devote themselves only to the care of the body.
Their ideal is to increase longevity. They serve the body day and night. That is not good.
Householder's duty
"What is your duty? You should renounce 'woman and gold' mentally. You cannot look on
the world as crow-droppings.
"The goswamis are householders. Therefore I said to them: 'You have your duties in the
temple; how can you renounce the world? You cannot explain away the world as māyā.'
"Chaitanyadeva said that the duties of householders were kindness to living beings,
service to the Vaishnavas, and the chanting of God's holy name.
"Keshab Sen once said about me: 'Now he asks us to hold to both-God and the world.
But one day he will sting us.' No, that is not true. Why should I sting?"
MANI MALLICK: "But, sir, you do."
631MASTER (smiling): "How so? You are a householder. Why should you renounce?
Complete renunciation for religious teachers
"But the renunciation of the world is needful for those whom God wants to be teachers of
men. One who is an Āchārya should give up 'woman and gold'; otherwise people will not
take his advice. It is not enough for him to renounce only mentally; he should also
renounce outwardly. Only then will his teaching bear fruit. Otherwise people will think,
'Though he asks us to give up "woman and gold," he enjoys them himself in secret.'
"A physician prescribed medicine for a patient. and said to him, 'Come another day and
I'll give you directions about diet.' The physician had several jars of molasses in his room
that day. The patient lived very far away. He visited the physician later and the physician
said to him: 'Be careful about your food. It is not good for you to eat molasses.' After the
patient left, another person who was there said to the physician: 'Why did you give him
all the trouble of coming here again? You could very well have given him the instructions
the first day.' The physician replied with a smile: There is a reason. I had several jars of
molasses in my room that day. If I had asked the patient then to give up molasses, he
would not have had faith in my words. He would have thought: "He has so many jars of
molasses in his room, he must eat some of it. Then molasses can't be so bad." Today I
have hidden the jars. Now he will have faith in my words.
"I have seen the Āchārya of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. I understand that he has married for
the second or third time. He has grown-up children. And such men are teachers! If they
say, 'God is real and all else illusory', who will believe them? You can very well
understand who will be their disciples.
Hard rules for a sannyāsi
"Like teacher, like disciple. Even if a sannyāsi renounces 'woman and gold' mentally, but
lives with them outwardly, he cannot be a teacher of men. People will say that he enjoys
'molasses' secretly.
"Once Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi gave five rupees to Ramlal. I didn't know about it.
When Ramlal told me about the money, I asked him, 'For whom was the money given?'
He said it was for me. At first I thought that I should use it to pay what I owed for my
milk, But will you believe me? I had slept only a little while when I suddenly woke up
writhing with pain, as if a cat were scratching my chest. I went to Ramlal and asked him
again, 'Was the money given for your aunt?' 'No', Ramlal answered. Thereupon I said to
him, 'Go at once and return the money.' Ramlal gave it back the next day.
"Do you know how it looks for a sannyāsi to accept money or to be attached to an object
of temptation? It is as if a brahmin widow who had practised continence and lived on
simple boiled rice and vegetables and milk for many years, were suddenly to accept an
untouchable as her paramour. (All look stunned.)
"There was a low-caste woman named Bhagi Teli in our part of the country. She had
many disciples and devotees. Finding that she, a sudra, was being saluted by people, the
632landlord became jealous and engaged a wicked man to tempt her. He succeeded in
corrupting her and all her spiritual practice came to nothing. A fallen sannyāsi is like
that.
"You are leading householders' lives. It is necessary for you to live in the company of
holy men. First of all, the company of holy men; then sraddha, faith in God.
"How can people have reverence and faith in God if the holy men do not sing His name
and glories? People respect a man if they know that in his family there have been royal
ministers for three generations.
(To M.) "Even if one has attained Knowledge, one must still constantly practise God-
Consciousness. Nangta used to say: 'What is the use of polishing the outside of a metal
pot one day only? If you don't polish it regularly it will get tarnished again.' I shall have
to go to your house some time. If I know your house I can meet other devotees there.
Please go to see Ishan some time.
(To Manilal) "Keshab Sen's mother came here the other day. The young boys of her
family sang the name of Hari. She went around them clapping her hands. I noticed she
was not very much stricken with grief over Keshab's death. She observed the fast of
ekadasi here and counted her beads. I was pleased to see her devotion to God."
About Keshab and Vijay
MANILAL: "Ramkamal Sen, Keshab Babu's grandfather, was a devotee of God. He used
to sit in a tulsi-grove and repeat God's holy name. Pyarimohan, Keshab's father, was
also a Vaishnava devotee."
MASTER: "The son could not have been so devoted to God if the father had not been like
that. Look at Vijay. His father would become unconscious of the world in divine ecstasy
while reading the Bhagavata. Vijay can hardly control his emotion: while uttering Hari's
name, he sometimes stands up from his seat. The forms of God that Vijay sees
nowadays are all real. Speaking about the different aspects of God, formless and with
form, Vijay said that God sometimes appears with attributes and sometimes without
attributes. He gave the example of the chameleon, which sometimes turns red,
sometimes blue, sometimes green, and sometimes remains colourless.
Praise of guilelessness and purity
"Vijay is really guileless. One cannot realize God without being guileless and liberal-
minded. Yesterday Vijay was at Adhar Sen's house. He behaved as if it were his own
place and those who lived there his own people. One cannot be guileless and liberal-
minded unless one is free from worldliness."
Then the Master sang:
You will attain that priceless Treasure when your mind is free from stain. . . .
633He continued: "You cannot make a pot without first carefully preparing the clay. The pot
will crack if the clay contains particles of sand or stone. That is why the potter first
prepares the clay by removing the sand and stones.
"If a mirror is covered with dirt, it won't reflect one's face. A man cannot realize his true
Self unless his heart is pure. You will find guilelessness wherever God incarnates Himself
as man. Nandaghosh, Daśaratha, Vasudeva -all of them were guileless.
"The Vedānta says that a man does not even desire to know God unless he has a pure
mind. One cannot be guileless and liberal-minded without much tapasya or unless it is
one's last birth."
Master's guilelessness
Sri Ramakrishna was worrying, like a child, because he thought his legs were slightly
swollen. Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi entered the room and. saluted the Master.
MASTER (to the devotees): "Yesterday I said to Naran, 'Just press your leg and see if
there is any dimple.' He pressed it and there was one. Then I
gave a sigh of relief. (To Mukherji) Will you please press your leg? Is there any dimple?"
MUKHERJI: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Ah, what a relief!"
MANI MALLICK: "Why should you worry about it, sir? Please take your bath in the river.
Why should you take medicine?"
MASTER: "No, sir. You have strong blood. Your case is different. The Divine Mother has
placed me in the state of a child. One day I was bitten by something in the jungle. I had
heard people say that, in case of snakebite, the poison would come out if the snake bit
again. So I put my hand in a hole and waited. A man passing by said to me: 'What are
you doing? You will get rid of the poison only if the snake bites again in the same place.
You will not be cured if the snake bites another part of your body.'
"I was told that the autumn dew was good. One day, while coming from Calcutta, I stuck
my head out of the carriage and exposed it to the damp air. (All laugh.)
(To Mahendra of Sinthi) "That pundit from Sinthi is very good. He holds a title for this
scholarship. He respects me. I said to him, 'You have read a great deal; but give up the
vanity that you are a scholar.' That made him very happy. I discussed Vedānta with him.
Nature of Brahman
(To M.): "That which is Pure Ātman is unattached. Māyā, or avidyā, is in It. In māyā
there are three Gunās : sattva, rajas, and tamas. These three Gunās also exist in the
Pure Ātman. But Ātman Itself is unattached. If you throw a blue pill into the fire, you will
634see a blue flame. If you throw a red pill, you will see a red flame. But fire itself has no
colour of its own.
"If you put a blue pill in water, the water will turn blue. Again, if you put alum in that
water, it will regain its natural colour.
"A butcher was carrying a load of meat when he touched Sankara. Sankara exclaimed:
'What! You have touched me!' The butcher replied: 'Venerable sir, neither have you
touched me nor have I touched you. You are pure Ātman, unattached.' Jadabharata said
the same thing to King Rahugana.
"The Pure Ātman is unattached, and one cannot see It. If salt is mixed with water, one
cannot see the salt with the eyes.
"That which is the Pure Ātman is the Great Cause, the Cause of the cause. The gross,
the subtle, the causal, and the Great Cause. The five elements are gross. Mind, buddhi,
and ego are subtle. Prakriti, the Primal Energy, is the cause of all these. Brahman, Pure
Ātman, is the Cause of the cause.
This Pure Ātman alone is our real nature. What is jnāna? It is to know one's own Self and
keep the mind in It. It is to know the Pure Ātman.
"How long should a man perform his duties? As long as he identifies himself with the
body, in other words, as long as he thinks he is the body. That is what the Gitā says. To
think of the body as the Ātman is ajnāna, ignorance.
(To the bearded Brahmo devotee from Shibpur) "Are you a Brahmo?"
DEVOTEE: "Yes, sir."
MASTER (smiling): "I can recognize a worshipper of the Formless by looking at his face
and eyes. Please dive a little deeper. One doesn't get the gem by floating on the surface.
As for myself, I accept all-the formless God and God with form."
The Mārwāri devotees from Burrabazar entered the room and saluted the Master. He
began to praise them.
MASTER (to the devotees):"Ah! They are real devotees of God. They visit temples, sing
hymns to God, and eat prasad. And the gentleman whom they have made their priest
this year is learned in the Bhagavata."
MĀRWĀRI DEVOTEE: "Who is this 'I' that says, 'O Lord, I am Thy servant?' "
MASTER: "This is the lingasarira, or embodied soul. It consists of manas, buddhi, chitta,
and Ahamkāra."
DEVOTEE: "Who is the embodied soul?"
635MASTER: "It is the Ātman bound by the eight fetters. And what is the chitta? It is the 'I-
consciousness' that says, 'Aha!'"
What happens after death
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, what happens after death?"
MASTER: "According to the Gitā, one becomes afterwards what one thinks of at the time
of death. King Bharata thought of his deer and became a deer in his next life. Therefore
one must practise sādhanā in order to realize God. If a man thinks of God day and night,
he will have the same thought in the hour of death."
Māyā hides Knowledge
DEVOTEE: "Why don't we feel dispassion toward worldly objects?"
MASTER: "Because of māyā. Through māyā one feels the Real to be the unreal and the
unreal to be the Real. The Real means That which is eternal, the Supreme Brahman; and
the unreal means that which is non- eternal, that is to say, the world."
DEVOTEE: "We read the scriptures. Why is it that we can't assimilate them?"
MASTER: "What will one accomplish by mere reading? One needs spiritual practice-
austerity. Call on God. What is the use of merely repeating the word 'siddhi'? One must
eat a little of it.
'The hand bleeds when it touches a thorny plant. Suppose you bring such a plant and
repeat, sitting near it: 'There! The plant is burning.' Will that burn the plant? This world
is like the thorny plant. Light the fire of Knowledge and with it set the plant ablaze. Only
then will it be burnt up.
"One must labour a little while at the stage of sādhanā . Then the path becomes easy.
Steer the boat around the curves of the river and then let it go with the favourable wind.
"As long as you live inside the house of māyā, as long as there exists the cloud of

'woman and gold' and, thus standing apart, practises a little austerity and spiritual
discipline. Then only does the cloud of his ego and ignorance vanish. Then only does he
attain the Knowledge of God. This 'woman and gold' is the only cloud that hides the Sun
of Knowledge.
636Master's renunciation
(To the Mārwāri devotee) "The rules for a sannyāsi are extremely hard. He cannot have
the slightest contact with 'woman and gold'. He must not accept money with his own
hands, and he must not even allow it to be left near him.
"Lakshminarayan Mārwāri, a Vedantist, used to come here very often. One day he saw a
dirty sheet on my bed and said: 'I shall invest ten thousand rupees in your name. The
interest will enable you to pay your expenses.' The moment he uttered these words, I
fell unconscious, as if struck by a stick. Regaining consciousness I said to him: 'If you
utter such words again, you had better not come here. It is impossible for me to touch
money. It is also impossible for me to keep it near me.' He was a very clever fellow. He
said: 'Then you too have the idea of acceptance and rejection. In that case you haven't
attained Perfect Knowledge.' 'My dear sir, I said, 'I haven't yet gone that far.' (All laugh.)
Lakshminarayan then wanted to leave the money with Hriday. I said to him: 'That will
not do. If you leave it with Hriday, then I shall instruct him to spend it as I wish. If he
does not comply, I shall be angry. The very contact of money is bad. No, you can't leave
it with Hriday.' Won't an object kept near a mirror be reflected in it?"
Liberation
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, is a man liberated only when he dies on the bank of the
Ganges?"
MASTER: "It is the Knowledge of God alone that gives liberation. The Jnāni will certainly
attain liberation wherever he may die, whether in the charnel-pit or on the bank of the
,Ganges. But the bank of the Ganges is prescribed for a bound soul."
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, why does a man dying in Benares become liberated?"
MASTER: "A person dying in Benares sees the vision of Śiva. Śiva says to him: 'This is
My aspect with form, My embodiment in māyā. I assume this form for the sake of the
devotees. Now look. I am merging in the indivisible Satchidananda!' Uttering these
words, Śiva withdraws His form and enables the dying person to see Brahman. "The
Puranas say that even a chandala endowed with love of God achieves liberation.
According to this school the name of God is enough to liberate a soul. There is no need
of such things as worship, sacrifice, the discipline of Tantra, and the recitation of
mantras.
Path of devotion for Kaliyuga
"But the teachings of the Vedas are different. According to the Vedas none but a
brahmin can be liberated. Further, the worship is not accepted by the gods unless the
mantras are recited correctly. One must perform sacrifice, worship, and so on, according
to scriptural injunction. But where is the time in the Kaliyuga to perform the Vedic
rituals? Therefore in the Kaliyuga the path of devotion prescribed by Nārada is best. The
path of karma is very difficult. Karma becomes a cause of bondage unless it is performed
in a spirit of detachment. Further, the life of man nowadays depends on food. He has no
time to observe the rituals enjoined by the scriptures. The patient dies if he tries to cure
637his fever by taking the decoction of herbs prescribed by the orthodox native physicians.
Therefore he should take a modern 'fever mixture'.
"According to Nārada the devotee should sing the name and glories of God. The path of
karma is not the right one for the Kaliyuga. Bhaktiyoga is the right path. Do your duties
in the world as long as you need them to reap the fruit of the actions of your past lives.
But you must develop love for God and be passionately attached to Him. The singing of
the name and glories of God destroys the effect of past action.
"You don't have to perform duties all your life. As you develop unalloyed love and
longing for God, your duties become fewer and fewer. After the realization of God they
completely drop away. When the young daughter-in-law is pregnant, her mother-in-law
lessens her duties. After the birth of the child she doesn't have to do any household
work."
Several young men from the village of Dakshineswar entered the room and saluted Sri
Ramakrishna. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. They sat down and began to
talk with the Master.
YOUNG MAN: "Sir, what is Knowledge?"
MASTER: "It is to know that God is the only Reality and that all else is unreal. That which
is the Real is also called Brahman. It has another name: Kala, Time. There is a saying,
'O brother, how many things come into being in Time and disappear in Time!'
"That whieh sports with Kala is called Kāli. She is the Primal Energy. Kala and Kāli,
Brahman and Śakti, are indivisible.
"That Brahman, of the nature of Reality, is eternal. It exists in past, present, and future.
It is without beginning or end. It cannot be described in words. The utmost that can be
said of Brahman is that It is of the very nature of Intelligence and Bliss.
"The world is illusory; Brahman alone is real. The world is of the nature of magic. The
magician is real but his magic is unreal"
Power of inborn tendencies
YOUNG MAN: "If the world is of the nature of illusion-magic-then why doesn't one get rid
of it?"
MASTER: "It is due to the samskaras, inborn tendencies. Repeated births in this world of
māyā make one believe that māyā is real.
"Let me tell you how powerful inborn tendencies are. A prince had, in a previous birth,
been the son of a washerman. While playing with his chums in his incarnation as the
prince, he said to them: 'Stop those games. I will show you a new one. I shall lie on my
belly, and you will beat the clothes on my back as the washerman does, making a
swishing sound.'
638"Many youngsters come here. But only a few long for God. These few are born with a
spiritual tendency. They shudder at the talk of marriage. Niranjan has said from boyhood
that he will not marry.
"More than twenty years ago two young men used to come here from Baranagore. One
was named Govinda Pal and the other Gopal Sen. They had been devoted to God since
boyhood. The very mention of marriage would frighten them. Gopal used to have bhava
samādhi. He would shrink from worldly people, as a mouse from a cat. One day he saw
the boys of the Tagore family strolling in the garden. He shut himself in the kuthi lest he
should have to talk with them.
"Gopal went into samādhi in the Panchavati. In that state he said to me, touching my
feet: 'Let me go. I cannot live in this world any more. You have a long time to wait. Let
me go.' I said to him, in an ecstatic mood, 'You must come again.' 'Very well, I will', he
said. A few days later Govinda came to me. 'Where is Gopal?' I asked him. He said, 'He
has passed away.'
"What are the other youngsters about? Money, house, carriage, clothes, and finally
marriage. These are the things that keep them busy. If they want to marry, at the outset
they make inquiries about the girl. They want to find out for themselves whether she is
beautiful.
"There is a person who speaks much ill of me. He is always criticizing me for loving the
youngsters. I love only those who are born with good tendencies, pure souls with longing
for God, who do not pay any attention to money, creature comforts, and such things.
"If married people develop love for God, they will not be attached to the world.
Hirananda is married. What if he is? He will not be much attached to the world."
Hirananda, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, was a native of Sindh. He had met the
Master in Calcutta and become devoted to him.
Manilal, the Mārwāri devotees, the Brahmo devotees from Shibpur, and the young men
from Dakshineswar saluted Sri Ramakrishna and took their leave.
It was evening. Lamps were lighted on the south and west verandahs. A lamp was
lighted in the Master's room also, and incense was burnt. He was repeating the name of
the Divine Mother, absorbed in contemplation of Her. After a while he talked again to the
devotees. There was still some time before the evening worship in the temples.
MASTER (to M.): "What need of the sandhya has a man who thinks of God day and
night?
What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any
more,
If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours?
Rituals may pursue him close, but never can they overtake him.
639Charity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan's
mind;
The Blissful Mother's Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and
sacrifice.
"The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om. A man is firmly established in
spiritual life when he goes into samādhi on uttering 'Om' only once.
"There is a sādhu in Hrishikesh who gets up early in the morning and stands near a great
waterfall. He looks at it the whole day and says to God: 'Ah, You have done well! Well
done! How amazing! He doesn't practise any other form of japa or austerity. At night he
returns to his hut.
"What need is there even to bother one's head about whether God is formless or has a
form? It is enough for a man to pray to Him, alone in solitude, weeping, 'O God, reveal
Yourself to me as You are.'
"God is both inside and outside. It is He who dwells inside us. Therefore the Vedas say,
'Tattvamasi-That thou art.' God is also outside us. He appears manifold through māyā;
but in reality He alone exists. Therefore before describing the various names and forms
of God, one should say, 'Om Tat Sat.'
"It is one thing to learn about God from the scriptures, and quite another to see Him.
The scriptures only give hints. Therefore to read a great many scriptures is not
necessary. It is much better to pray to God in solitude.
"It isn't necessary to read all of the Gitā. One can get the essence of the Gitā by
repeating the word ten times. It becomes reversed and is then 'tagi'. The essence of the
book is: 'O man, renounce everything and worship God.'"
The Master went into an ecstatic mood while watching the evening worship of Kāli in the
company of the devotees. He was in no condition even to salute the image. Very
carefully he returned to his room with the devotees and sat down; he was still in an
ecstatic mood. He spoke to them while in that state.
In the room was Hari, a young man about twenty years of age, who was a relative of the
Mukherjis and very much devoted to the Master. He was married. At that time he was
living with the Mukherjis and looking for a job.
MASTER (to Hari, in an ecstatic mood): "Take your initiation after getting your mother's
permission. (To Priya, referring to Hari) I couldn't give him the mantra though I said I
would initiate him. I don't initiate people. Continue with your own meditation and japa as
you have been doing."
PRIYA: "Yes, sir."
640MASTER: "And I am saying this to you in this state of my mind. Believe my words. You
see, there is no show or deceit here. I just said to the Divine Mother in my ecstatic
mood, 'O Mother, may those who come here [referring to himself] through sincere
attraction obtain perfection!' "
Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi was seated on the verandah conversing with Ramlal, Hazra,
and others. The Master called to him from his room. M. went out quickly and brought
Mahendra in.
MASTER (to Mahendra): "Sit down and listen to my words."
Mahendra was a little embarrassed. He sat down.
Various forms of divine love
MASTER (to the devotees): "God can be served in different ways. An ecstatic lover of
God enjoys Him in different ways. Sometimes he says, 'O God, You are the lotus and I
am the bee', and sometimes, 'You are the Ocean of Satchidananda and I am the fish.'
Sometimes, again, the lover of God says, 'I am Your dancing-girl.' He dances and sings
before Him. He thinks of himself sometimes as the friend of God and sometimes as His
handmaid. He looks on God sometimes as a child, as did Yaśoda, and sometimes as
husband or sweetheart, as did the gopis.
"Sometimes Balarama looked on Krishna as a friend; sometimes he would think he was
Krishna's umbrella or carpet. He served Krishna in all possible ways."
Was Sri Ramakrishna hinting at his own state of mind while thus describing the different
attitudes of a lover of God?
Chaitanya's spiritual moods
Next he described Chaitanya's three spiritual moods.
MASTER: "Chaitanyadeva used to experience three moods. In the inmost mood he would
be absorbed in samādhi, unconscious of the outer world. In the semi-conscious mood he
would dance in ecstasy but could not talk. In the conscious mood he would sing the
glories of God.
(To the devotees) "You are listening to my words. Try to assimilate them. When worldly
people sit before a sādhu, for the time being they completely hide all worldly thoughts
and ideas. But once away from the holy man they let them out again. You have seen a
pigeon eating dried peas. You think he has digested them, but he keeps them in his
crop. You can feel them there.
"At dusk put aside all duties and pray to God. One is reminded of Him by darkness. At
the approach of darkness one thinks: 'I could see everything a moment ago. Who has
brought about this change?' The Muslims put aside all activities and say their prayers
at the appointed times."
641Practice of japa
MUKHERJI: "Revered sir, is it good to practise japa?"
MASTER: "Yes. One attains God through japa. By repeating the name of God secretly
and in solitude one receives divine grace. Then comes His vision. Suppose there is a big
piece of timber lying under water and fastened to the land with a chain; by proceeding
along the chain, link by link, you will at last touch the timber.
"Higher than worship is japa, higher than japa is meditation, higher than meditation is
bhava, and higher than bhava are mahabhava and prema. Chaitanyadeva had prema,
When one attains prema one has the rope to tie God."
Hazra entered the room.
MASTER (to Hazra): "Love of God, when it is intense and spontaneous, is called raga-
bhakti. Vaidhi-bhakti, formal devotion, depends on scriptural injunctions. It comes and it
goes. But raga-bhakti is like a stone emblem of Śiva that has sprung up out of the
bowels of the earth. One cannot find its root; they say the root goes as far as Benares.
Only an Incarnation of God and His companions attain raga-bhakti."
HAZRA: "Ah me!"
MASTER: "One day I was returning from the Pine-grove, when I saw you telling your
beads. I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, what a small minded fellow he is! He lives
here and still he pratises japa with a rosary! Whoever comes he [referring to himself]
will have his spiritual consciousness awakened all a once; he won't have to bother much,
about japa. Go to Calcutta and you will find thousands telling their beads-even the
prostitutes.'
(To M.) "Please bring Naran here in a carriage. I am making the same request to
Mukherji. I shall give Naran something to eat when he comes. There is great significance
in feeding boys like him."
Saturday, October 4, 1884
It was the day of the first full moon after the Durga Puja. Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the
Calcutta house of Nabin Sen, the elder brother of Keshab Chandra Sen. On the previous
Thursday Keshab's mother had begged the Master to pay her a visit in Calcutta.
The Master seated himself in a room on the upper floor of the house. With him were
Baburam, Kishori, and a few other devotees. Nandalal and Keshab's other nephews,
Keshab's mother, and other relatives of his, waited on the Master. It had been arranged
to have devotional music performed in the room. M. was sitting in a room downstairs,
listening to the kirtan.
Master with Brahmo devotees
Sri Ramakrishna said to the Brahmo devotees: "The world is impermanent. One should
constantly remember death." Then he sang:
642Remember this, O mind! Nobody is your own:
Vain is your wandering in this world.
Trapped in the subtle snare of māyā as you are,
Do not forget the Mother's name. . . .
The Master said to the devotees: "Dive deep. What will you gain by merely floating on
the surface? Renounce everything for a few days, retire into solitude, and call on God
with all your soul"
The Master sang:
Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in. the Ocean of God's Beauty;
If you descend to the uttermost depths,
There you will find the gem of Love. . . .
At Sri Ramakrishna's request the Brahmo devotees sang:
Thou art my All in All, O Lord!- the Life of my life, the Essence
of essence;
In the three worlds I have none else but Thee to call my own.
Thou art my peace, my joy, my hope;
Thou my support, my wealth, my glory;
Thou my wisdom and my strength. . . .
The Master sang again:
O Mother, for Yaśoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called
Thee her precious "Blue Jewel":
Where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, O terrible Syama? . .
.
The Brahmo devotees also sang to theaccompaniment of cymbals and drums:
O Mother, how deep is Thy love for men!
Mindful of it, I weep for joy.
Almost from the day of my birth
I have transgressed Thine every law,
And still Thou lookest on me with love,
Comforting me with sweetest words.
Mindful of it, I weep for joy.
O Mother, the burden of Thy love
Is far too great for me to bear;
My soul gives a heart-piercing cry
At Thy love's touch. To Thee I come,
Seeking a refuge at Thy feet.
643They again sang of the Divine Mother:
O Mother, Thou my Inner Guide, ever awake within my heart!
Day and night Thou holdest me in Thy lap.
Why dost Thou show such tenderness to this unworthy child of
Thine'?
Ah! It seems Thou art mad with love: now caressing, now with
strong grasp
Holding me firm, Thou givest me to drink
Thy nectar, pouring in my ears Thy words of loving
tenderness.
Unceasing is Thy love for me, a love that cannot see my faults ;
Whenever I am in danger, Thou dost save me.
Saviour of sinners! I know the truth: I am my Mother's and She
is mine.
Now I shall listen to Her alone, and follow the path of
righteousness;
Drinking the milk that flows from my Mother's breasts,
I shall be strong and sing with joy: "Hail, O Mother! Brahman
Eternal!"
The Master and the Brahmo devotees sang several songs about Hari and Gaurānga.
Sunday, October 5, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room after the midday meal, with M., Hazra, the elder
Kāli, Baburam, Ramlal, Hari, and others. Some of them sat on the floor and some stood
about. On the previous day the Master had visited Keshab's mother at her Calcutta
house and had made her happy with his devotional songs.
Hazra's eccentricities
Hazra had been living with the Master at Dakshineswar a long time. He was a little
conceited about his knowledge and even criticized the Master now and then before
others. Again, he would sit on the verandah of the Master's room and tell his beads with
apparent concentration. He spoke slightingly of Chaitanya as a "modern Incarnation". He
would say: "God gives not only pure devotion but also wealth. He has no lack of it. By
attaining God one obtains the eight occult powers as well." Hazra had a small debt to
clear up, about one thousand rupees. He had incurred it for the building of his house and
was worried about paying it.
The elder Kāli had a position in an office, from which he received a small salary. He had
a large family to maintain. He was devoted to the Master and visited him now and then,
even absenting himself from the office.
644KALl (to Hazra): "You go about criticizing people; you are like a touchstone, testing what
is pure gold and what is impure. Why do you speak so much ill of others?" HAZRA:
"Whatever I say, I say to him [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] alone."
MASTER: "That is so."
Hazra began to explain Tattvajnana.
HAZRA: "The meaning of Tattvajnana is the knowledge of the existence of the twenty-
four tattvas, or cosmic principles."
He was wrong about the meaning of the word.
A DEVOTEE: "What are they?"
HAZRA: "The five elements, the six passions, the five organs of perception, the five
organs of action, and so forth."
M. (to the Master, smiling): "He says that the six passions are included in the twenty-
four cosmic principles."
MASTER (smiling): "Listen to him! Notice how he explains Tattvajnana! The word really
means 'knowledge of Self'. The word 'Tat' means the Supreme Self, and the word 'tvam',
the embodied soul. One attains Supreme Knowledge, Tattvajnana, by realizing the
identity of the embodied soul and the Supreme Self."
After a few minutes Hazra left the room and sat on the porch.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "He [meaning Hazra] only argues. This moment perhaps
he understands, but the next moment he is his old self again.
"When the angler hooks a big fish and finds it pulling hard, he releases the line;
otherwise it will snap and the angler himself will be thrown into the water. Therefore I do
not say much to him.
(To M.) "Hazra said that a man could not be liberated unless he was born in a brahmin
body. 'How is that?' I said. 'One attains liberation through bhakti alone. Savari was the
daughter of a hunter. She, Ruhidas, and others belonged to the sudra caste. They were
liberated through bhakti alone.' 'But still-Hazra insisted.
"He recognized Dhruva's spiritual greatness, but not as much as he recognized
Prahlada's. When Lātu said, 'Dhruva had great yearning for God from his boyhood', he
kept still.
"I said that there was nothing greater than the bhakti that sought no end and had no
selfish motive. Hazra contradicted me. I said to him, 'A wealthy man is annoyed when a
petitioner comes to him. "There he comes", he says angrily. "Sit down", he says to him
645in an indifferent voice, and shows that he is much annoyed. He doesn't allow such a
beggar to ride with him in his carriage.'
"But Hazra said that God was not like such wealthy people of the world; did He lack
wealth, that He should feel pinched to give it away? Hazra said further: 'When rain falls
from the sky, the Ganges and all the big rivers and lakes overflow with water. Small
tanks, too, are filled. Likewise, God out of His grace grants wealth and riches as well as
knowledge and devotion.'
(To the devotees) "But I call this impure devotion to God. Pure devotion has no desire
behind it. You don't want anything from me, but you love to see me and hear my words.
My mind also dwells on you. I wonder how you are and why you don't come.
"You don't want anything of God but still you love Him. That is pure bhakti, love of God
with no motive behind it. Prahlada had it. He sought neither kingdom nor riches; he
sought Hari alone."
M: "Hazra is a chatterbox. He won't achieve anything unless he becomes silent."
MASTER: "Now and then he comes to me and becomes mellowed. But he is a pest; again
he argues. It is very hard to get rid of egotism. You may cut down an Aśwattha tree, but
the next day a sprout will spring up. As long as the roots remain, the tree will grow
again.
"I said to Hazra, 'Don't speak ill of anyone.' It is Narayana Himself who has assumed all
these forms. One can worship even a wicked person. Haven't you observed the Kumari
Puja? Why should you worship a girl who has all the physical limitations of a human
being? It is because she is a form of the Divine Mother. But God dwells in a special way
in His devotee. The devotee is His parlour. If the gourd has a large body then it makes a
good Tānpura. It gives a nice sound."
Two monks had arrived at the temple garden in the morning. They were devoted to the
study of the Bhagavad Gitā, the Vedānta, and other scriptures. They entered the
Master's room, saluted him, and sat on the mat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna was
seated on the small couch. The Master spoke to the sādhus in Hindusthani.
MASTER: "Have you had your meal?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "What did you eat?"
SĀDHU: "Dal and bread. Will you take some?"
MASTER: "No, I take only a few morsels of rice. Well, your japa and meditation must be
without any desire for results. Isn't that so?"
646SĀDHU: "Yes, Sir."
MASTER: "That is good. One must surrender the result to God. What do you say? That is
the view of the Gitā."
One sādhu said to the other, quoting from the Gitā: "O Arjuna, whatever action you
perform, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give in charity,
and whatever austerities you practise, offer everything to Me."
MASTER: "If you give God something, you receive it back a thousand times over. That is
why after doing meritorious deeds one offers a handful of water to God. It is the symbol
of offering the fruit to God. When Yudhisthira was about to offer all his sins to Krishna,
Bhima warned him: 'Never do such a thing. Whatever you offer to Krishna you will
receive back a thousandfold.'
(To one of the sādhus) "Well, sir, one should be de- sireless; one should renounce all
desires. Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "But I have the desire for bhakti. That is not bad. Rather, it is good. Sweets
are bad, for they produce acidity. But sugar candy is an exception. Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Well, sir, what do you think of the Vedānta?"
SĀDHU: "It includes all the six systems of philosophy."
MASTER: "But the essence of Vedānta is: 'Brahman alone is real, and the world illusory;
I have no separate existence; I am that Brahman alone.' Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "That is true, sir."
MASTER: "But for those who lead a householder's life, and those who identify themselves
with the body, this attitude of 'I am He' is not good. It is not good for householders to
read Vedānta or the Yoga-vāsishta. It is very harmful for them to read these books.
Householders should look on God as their Master and on themselves as His servants.
They should think, 'O God, You are the Master and the Lord, and I am Your servant.'
People who identify themselves with the body should not have the attitude of 'I am He'."
The devotees in the room remained silent. Sri Ramakrishna was smiling a little, a picture
of self-contentment. He appeared happy in his own Self.
One of the sādhus whispered in the other's ear: "Look! This is the state of the
paramahamsa."
647MASTER (to M.): "I feel like laughing."
Sri Ramakrishna smiled like a child. The monks left the room. The devotees were moving
about in the room and on the porch.
Master ( to M.) :"Did you go to Nabin Sen's house?"
M:"Yes, sir. I listened to the songs from down stairs."
MASTER: "That was well done. Your wife was there. She is a cousin of Keshab Sen, isn't
she?"
M: "A distant cousin."
Sri Ramakrishna strolled up and down with M. No one else was with them.
MASTER: "A man visits his father-in-law's house. I, too, often used to think that I should
marry, go to my father-in-law's house, and have great fun. But see what has come of
it!"
M: "Sir, you say, 'If the boy holds his father's hand, he may slip; but he doesn't if the
father holds his hand.' That is exactly your condition. The Mother has taken hold of your
hand."
MASTER: "I met Bamandas at the Viswases' house. I said to him, 'I have come to see
you.' As I was leaving the place I heard him say: 'Goodness gracious! The Divine Mother
has caught hold of him, like a tiger seizing a man.' At that time I was a young man, very
stout, and always in ecstasy.
Master's attitude toward women
"I am very much afraid of women. When I look at one I feel as if a tigress were coming
to devour me. Besides, I find that their bodies, their limbs, and even their pores are very
large. This makes me look upon them as she-monsters. I used to be much more afraid
of women than I am at present. I wouldn't allow one to come near me. Now I persuade
my mind in various ways to look upon women as forms of the Blissful Mother.
"A woman is, no doubt, a part of the Divine Mother. But as far as a man is concerned,
especially a sannyāsi or a devotee of God, she is to be shunned. I don't allow a woman
to sit near me very long, no matter how great her devotion may be. After a little while I
say to her, 'Go and see the temples.'
If that doesn't make her move, I myself leave the room on the pretext of smoking.
"I find that some men are not at all interested in women. Niranjan says, 'A woman never
enters my thought.' I asked Hari about it. He too says that his mind does not dwell on
woman.
648"Woman monopolizes three quarters of the mind, which should be given to God. And
then, after the birth of a child, almost the whole mind is frittered away on the family.
Then what is left to give to God?
"Again, there are some men who shed their last drop of blood, as it were, to keep their
wives out of mischief. There is the gate-keeper, an old man, whose wife is only fourteen
years old. She had to live with him. They lived in a thatched hut with walls made of dry
leaves. People made holes in the wall to peep in. Now she has left him and run away.
"I know another man. He doesn't know where to keep his wife. There was some trouble
at home, and now he is greatly worried. Let's not talk about these things any more.
"If a man lives with a woman, he cannot help coming under her control. Worldly men get
up and sit down at the bidding of women. They all speak highly of their wives.
"Once I wanted to go to a certain place. I asked Ramlal's aunt about it. She forbade me
to go; so I could not. A little while later I said to myself: 'I am not a householder. I have
renounced "woman and gold". If, in spite of that, this is my plight, one can well imagine
how much worldly people are controlled by their wives.'"
M: "One who lives in the midst of 'woman and gold' can't help being stained by it, even if
only slightly. You told us about Jaynarayan. He was such a great scholar. When you
visited him he was an old man. You found him warming pillows and blankets in the sun."
MASTER: "But he had no vanity of scholarship. Further, what he said about the last days
of his life came to pass. He spent them in Benares, following the injunctions of the
scriptures. I saw his children. They were wearing high boots and had been educated in
English schools."
By means of questions and answers Sri Ramakrishna now explained to M. his own
exalted state.
MASTER: "At first I went stark mad. Why am I less so now? But I get into that state now
and then."
M: "You don't have just one mood. As you said, you experience various moods.
Sometimes you are like a child, sometimes like a madman, sometimes like an inert
thing, and sometimes like a ghoul. And now and then you are a natural person."
MASTER: "Yes, like a child. But I also experience the moods of a boy and a young man.
When I give instruction I feel like a young man. Then there is my boyishness: like a boy
twelve or thirteen years old, I want to be frivolous. That is why I joke and make merry
with the youngsters.
"What do you think of Naran?"
M: "He has good traits, sir."
649MASTER: "Yes, the shell of the gourd is good. The Tānpura made out of it will give good
music. He says to me, 'You are everything.' Everyone speaks of me according to his
comprehension. Some say that I am simply a sādhu, a devotee of God.
"If I forbid Naran to do something, he understands it very well. The other day I asked
him to pull up the curtain, but he didn't do it. I had forbidden him to tie a knot, to sew
his clothes, to lock a box, to pull up a curtain, and similar things. He understood it all.
He who would renounce the world must practise all these disciplines. They are meant for
sannyāsis.
"While practising sādhanā a man should regard a woman as a raging forest fire or a black
cobra. But in the state of perfection, after the realization of God, she appears as the
Blissful Mother. Then you will look on her as a form of the Divine Mother."
A few days earlier Sri Ramakrishna had spoken many words of warning to Narayan about
women. He had said: "Don't let yourself touch the air near a woman's body. Cover
yourself with a heavy sheet lest the air should touch your body. And keep yourself eight
cubits, two cubits, or at least one cubit away from all women except your mother."
MASTER (to M.): "Naran's mother said to him about me, 'Even we are enchanted by the
sight of him, not to speak of you, a mere child.' None but the guileless can realize God.
How guileless Niranjan is!"
M: "True, sir."
MASTER: "Didn't you notice him that day in the carriage on the way to Calcutta? He is
always the same-without guile. A man shows one side of his nature inside his house and
another to the outside world. Since his father's death Narendra has been worried about
his worldly affairs. He has a slightly calculating mind. How I wish that other youngsters
were like Niranjan and Narendra!
"Today I went to the village to see Nilkantha's theatrical performance. It was given at
Nabin Niyogi's house. The children there are very bad; they have nothing to do but find
fault. In such a place a person's spiritual feeling is restrained. During a performance the
other day I saw Doctor Madhu shedding tears. I looked at him alone.
(To M.) "Can you tell me why people feel so much attracted to this place [meaning
himself]? What does it mean?"
M: "It reminds me of an episode in Krishna's life at Vrindāvan. Krishna transformed
Himself into the cowherd boys and the calves, whereupon the cows began to feel more
strongly attracted to the cowherd boys, the gopis, and the calves."
MASTER: "That is the attraction of God. The truth is, the Divine Mother creates the spell
and it is that which attracts people.
650"Well, not as many people come here as used to go to Keshab Sen. And how many
people respect and honour Keshab! He is known even in England. Queen Victoria spoke
with him. It is said in the Gitā that God's power is manifest in him who is honoured and
respected by many. But so many people do not come here."
M: "It was the householders who went to Keshab Sen."
MASTER: "Yes, that is true. The worldly-minded."
M: "Will what Keshab has founded remain a long time?"
MASTER: "Why, he has written a samhita, a book of rules for the guidance of the
members of his Brahmo Samaj."
M: "But it is quite different with the work done by a Divine Incarnation Himself-
Chaitanya's work, for instance."
MASTER: "Yes, yes. That is true."
M: "You yourself tell us that Chaitanyadeva said, 'The seeds I have sown will certainly
bear fruit some time or other.' A man left some seeds on the cornice of a house. Later on
the house fell down and trees grew from those seeds."
MASTER: "Many people go to the Samaj founded by Shivanath and friends. Isn't that
so?"
M: "Yes, sir. People of that sort."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, yes. The worldly-minded go there, but not many of those who
long for God and are trying to renounce 'woman and gold'."
M: "It will be fine if a current flows from this place. Everything will be carried away by its
force. Nothing that comes out of this place will be monotonous."
MASTER (smiling): "I keep men's own ideals intact. I ask a Vaishnava to hold to his
Vaishnava attitude and a Sakta to his. But this also I say to them 'Never feel that your
path alone is right and that the paths of others a wrong and full of errors. Hindus,
Muslims, and Christians are going to the same destination by different paths. A man
can realize God by following his own path if his prayer is sincere.
"Vijay's mother-in-law said to me, 'Why don't you tell Balarām that it unnecessary to
worship God with form; that it will be enough if he prays to the formless Satchidananda?'
I replied, 'Why should I say such a thing, and why should he listen to me even if I should
say it?' "
651M: "That is true, sir. There are different paths to suit time, place, and the fitness of the
candidate. Whatever path a man may follow, he will ultimately reach God if he is pure of
heart and has sincere longing. That is what you say."
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room. Hari, the relative of the Mukherjis, M., and
other devotees were on the floor. An unknown person saluted the Master and took a
seat. The Master remarked later that his eyes were not good. They were yellow, like a
cat's.
Hari prepared a smoke for Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER (to Hari): "Let me see the palm of your hand. This mark is good sign. Relax
your hand."
He took Hari's hand into his as if to feel its weight.
MASTER: "He is still childlike. As yet there is no blemish in him. (To the devotees) From
the hand I can tell whether a person is deceitful or guileless. (To Hari) Why, you should
go to your father-in-law's house. You should talk to your wife and have a little fun with
her if you like. (To M.) What do you say?" (M. and the others laugh.)
M: "If a new pot becomes bad, one can no longer keep milk in it."
MASTER (smiling): "How do you know that it is not already bad?"
The two Mukherjis, Mahendra and Priyanath, were brothers. They did not work in an
office, but had their own flour-mill. Priyanath had been an engineer. Sri Ramakrishna
talked to Hari about the Mukherji brothers.
MASTER: "The elder brother is nice, isn't he? He is artless."
HARI: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Isn't the younger brother very miserly? I understand that since coming here
he has improved a great deal. He once said to me, 'I didn't know anything before.' (To
Hari) Do they give anything in charity?"
HARI: "Not much, as far as I can see. Their elder brother, now dead, was a very good
man. He was very charitable."
Physical signs indicating character
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Whether a person will make spiritual progress or not
can be known to a great extent by his physical marks. The hand of a deceitful person is
heavy. A snub nose is not a good sign. Sambhu had that kind of nose; hence he was not
quite sincere in spite of all his wisdom. Pigeon-breast is not a good sign either. Hard
bones and heavy elbow-joints are bad signs too; and yellow eyes, like a cat's.
652"A man becomes very mean if he has lips that are thick, like a dome's. A brahmin was
here for a few months acting as priest of the Vishnu temple. I couldn't eat the food he
touched. One day I suddenly exclaimed, 'He is a dome!' Afterwards he said to me: 'Yes,
sir. We live in the dome quarters. I know how to make wicker baskets and such things,
Just like a dome.'
"There are other bad physical signs: one eye and squint eyes. It is rather better to have
one eye, but never squint eyes. Squint-eyed people are wicked and deceitful.

"A student of Mahesh Nyayaratna's came here. He described himself as an atheist. He said to Hriday: 'I am an atheist. You may take up the position of a believer in God and argue with me.'

I noticed that his eyes were yellow, like a cat's.

"Whether a person is good or bad can also be known from the way he walks."

Sri Ramakrishna paced the verandah. M. and Baburam walked with him.

MASTER (to Hazra): "A man came here. I saw that his eyes were like a cat's. He asked
me: 'Do you know astrology? I am in some difficulty.' I said: 'No, I don't. Go to
Baranagore. There you will find astrologers.'"

## Master and Nilkantha

Baburam and M. talked about Nilkantha's theatrical performance. Baburam had spent the previous night at the temple garden after his return from Nabin Sen's house. In the morning he had attended Nilkantha's performance with the Master.

MASTER (to M. and Baburam): "What are you talking about?"

M. AND BABURAM: "About Nilkantha's performance."

While pacing the verandah Sri Ramakrishna suddenly took M. aside and said, "The less
people know about your thoughts of God, the better for You," Saying these words the
Master abruptly went away. A short time afterwards he began to talk with Hazra.
HAZRA: "Nilkantha told you he would pay you a visit. It would be good send for him."
MASTER: "No, he didn't sleep at all last night. It will be different if he comes here
through the will of God."
Sri Ramakrishna asked Baburam to visit Narayan at his house. He looked on Narayan as
God Himself, and so he longed to see him. The Master said to Baburam, "You may go to
him with one of your English text-books."
About three o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room. Nilkantha
arrived with five or six of his companions. The Master went toward the east door as if to
653welcome him. The musicians bowed before the Master, touching the ground with their
foreheads.
Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. Baburam stood behind him. M., Nilkantha, and the
musicians were in front of him, watching him in great amazement. Dinanath, an officer
of the temple, looked on from the north side of the bed. Soon the room was filled with
officers of the temple garden. Sri Ramakrishna's ecstasy abated a little. He seated
himself on a mat on the floor, surrounded by Nilkantha and other devotees.
MASTER (still in an ecstatic mood): "I am all right."
NILKANTHA (with folded hands): "Make me all right too."
MASTER (smiling): "Why, you are already all right. Adding the letter to 'a', one gets 'ka'.
By adding another 'a' to 'ka', one still gets the same 'ka'." (All laugh.)
NILKANTHA: "Revered sir, I am entangled in worldliness."
MASTER (smiling): "God has kept you in the world for the sake of others. There are eight
fetters. One cannot get rid of them all. God keeps one or two so that a man may live in
the world and teach others. You have organized this theatrical company. How many
people are being benefited by seeing your bhakti! If you give up everything, then where
will these musicians go?
"God is now doing all these works through you. When they are finish, you will not return
to them. The housewife finishes her household duties feeds everyone, including the
menservants and maidservants, and then goes to take her bath. She doesn't come back
then even if people shout for her."
NILKANTHA: "Please bless me."
MASTER: "Yaśoda went mad with grief because she was separated from Krishna. She
went to Radhika, who was meditating. Radhika said to her an ecstatic state: 'I am the
Ultimate Prakriti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me.' Yaśoda said to her: 'What shall I
ask of You? Please bless me, that with all my body, mind, and speech I may think of God
and serve Him; that with my ears I may hear the singing of God's name and glories; that
with my hands I may serve Hari and His devotees; that with my eyes I may behold His
form and His devotees.'
"Your eyes fill with tears when you utter the name of God. Why then should you worry
about anything? Divine love has grown in you.
"To know many things is ajnāna, ignorance. To know only one thing is jnāna,
Knowledge-the realization that God alone is real and that He dwells in all. And to talk to
Him is vijnāna, a fuller Knowledge. To love God in different ways, after realizing Him, is
vijnāna.
654"It is also said that God is beyond one and two. He is beyond speech and mind. To go up
from the Lila to the Nitya and come down again from the Nitya to the Lila is mature
bhakti.
"I love that song of yours about aspiring to reach the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother. It
is enough to know that everything depends on the grace of God. But one must pray to
God; it will not do to remain inactive. The lawyer gives all the arguments and finishes his
pleading by saying to the judge: 'I have said all I have to say. Now the decision rests
with Your Honour.' "
After a few minutes Sri Ramakrishna said to Nilkantha: "You sang so much in the
morning, and now you have taken the trouble to come here. But here everything is
'honorary'."

NILKANTHA: "Why so?"
MASTER (smiling): "I know what you will say."
NILKANTHA: "I shall get a precious gem from here."
MASTER: "You already have that precious gem. What will you gain by adding again the
letter 'a' to 'ka'? If you didn't have the gem, should I like your songs so much?
Ramprasad had attained divine realization; that is why his songs appeal so much.
"I had already planned to hear your music. Later on Niyogi, too, came here to invite
me."
The Master was sitting on the small couch. He told Nilkantha that he would like to hear a
song or two about the Divine Mother.
Nilkantha sang two songs with his companions. When the Master heard the second song
he stood up and went into samādhi. Presently he began to dance in an ecstasy of divine
love. Nilkantha and the devotees sang and danced around him. Then Nilkantha sang a
song about Śiva, and the Master danced with the devotees.
When the singing was over, Sri Ramakrishna said to Nilkantha, "I should like to hear that
song of yours I heard in Calcutta."
M: "About Sri Gaurānga?"
MASTER: "Yes, yes!"
Nilkantha sang the song, "The beautiful Gaurānga, the youthful dancer, fair as molten
gold."
655Sri Ramakrishna sang again and again the line, "Everything is swept away by the onrush
of love", and danced with Nilkantha and the other devotees. Those who saw that
indescribable dancing were never to forget it. The room was filled with people, all
intoxicated with divine joy. It seemed as if Chaitanya himself were dancing with his
companions.
Manomohan was in an ecstatic mood. He was a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna and a
brother-in-law of Rākhāl. Several ladies of his family had come with him. They were
witnessing this divine music and dancing from the north verandah.
Sri Ramakrishna sang again, this time about Gaurānga and Nityananda:
Behold, the two brothers have came, who weep while chanting Hari's name. . . .
He danced with Nilkantha and the other devotees, improvising the line:
Behold, the two brothers have come, they who are mad with love of Radha.
Hearing the loud music, many people gathered about the room. The verandahs to the
south and north, and the semicircular porch to the west of the room, were crowded with
people. Even passengers in the boats going along the Gauges were attracted by the
kirtan.

The music was over Sri Ramakrishna bowed to the Divine Mother and said, "Bhagavata-
Bhakta-Bhagavan. My salutations to the jnanis, my salutations to the yogis, my
salutations to the bhaktas."

The Master was seated on the semicircular porch with Nilkantha and the other devotees.
The autumn moon flooded all the quarters with light. Sri Ramakrishna and Nilkantha
talked.

NILKANTHA: "You are none other than Gaurānga."
MASTER: "Why should you say such a thing? I am the servant of .the servant of all. The
waves belong to the Ganges; but does the Ganges belong to the waves?"
NILKANTHA: "You may say whatever you like, but we regard you as Gaurānga himself."
MASTER (tenderly, in an ecstatic mood): "My dear sir, I try to seek my 'I', but I do not
find it. Hanuman said: 'O Rāma, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a
part, and sometimes that You are the Master and I am Your servant. But when I have
the Knowledge of Reality, I see that You are I and I am You.'"
NILKANTHA: "What shall I say, sir? Please be gracious to us."
656MASTER (smiling): "You are ferrying many people across the ocean or the world. How
many hearts are illumined by hearing your music!"
NILKANTHA: "You talk of ferrying. But bless me that I may not be drowned in the ocean
myself."
MASTER (smiling): "If you get drowned, it will be in the Sea of Immortality."
Sri Ramakrishna was delighted with Nilkantha's company. He said to the musician: "For
you to have come here! You whom people see as a result of many austerities and
prayers! Listen to a song."
The Master sang a song, two lines of which ran:
When the Blissful Mother comes to my house, how much of the
Chandi I shall hear!
How many monks will come here, and how many yogis with
matted locks!
He said, continuing, "As long as the Divine Mother has come here, many yogis with
matted locks will come too."
Sri Ramakrishna laughed. To M., Baburam, and the other devotees he said: "I feel very
much like laughing. Just fancy, I am singing for these musicians!"
NILKANTHA: "We go about singing; but today we have had our true reward."
MASTER (smiling): 'when a shopkeeper sells an article, he sometimes gives a little extra
something to the buyer. You sang at Nabin's house and have given the extra something
here."
All laughed.
