Monday, June 4, 1883

Around 9 AM, the devotees began to arrive at the temple garden. 

Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the porch of his room facing the Ganges. M., who had spent the previous night with the Master, sat near him. Balarām and several
other devotees were present. Rākhāl lay on the floor, resting his head on the Master's
lap. 

For the past few days the Master had been regarding Rākhāl as the Baby Krishna. Seeing Trailokya passing on his way to the Kali temple, Sri Ramakrishna asked Rākhāl to
get up. Trailokya bowed to the Master. 

MASTER (to Trailokya): "Was there no yatra performance last night?"

TRAILOKYA: "No, sir. We couldn't conveniently arrange it."
MASTER: "What is done is done. But please see that this doesn't happen again. The
traditions of the temple should be properly observed."
Trailokya gave a suitable reply and went on his way. After a while Ram Chatterji, the
priest of the Vishnu temple, came up to Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER: "Well, Ram, I told Trailokya that the yatra performance should not be omitted
again. Was I right in saying that?".
RAM: "What of it, sir? Of course you were right. The traditions should be observed."
The Master asked Balarām to stay for his midday meal. Before the meal Sri
Ramakrishna described to the devotees the days of his God-intoxication. Rākhāl, M.,
Ramlal, and a few others were present.
Master's attitude toward young disciples
MASTER: "Now and then Hazra comes forward to teach me. He says to me, 'Why do you
think so much about the youngsters?' One day, as I was going to Balarām's house in a
carriage, I felt greatly troubled about it. I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, Hazra
admonishes me for worrying about Narendra and the other young boys. He asks me
why I forget God and think about these youngsters.' No sooner did this thought arise in
my mind than the Divine Mother revealed to me in a flash that it is She Herself who has
become man. But She manifests Herself most clearly through a. pure soul. At this
vision I went into samadhi. Afterwards I felt angry with Hazra. I said to myself, 'That
254rascal made me miserable.' Then I thought: 'But why should I blame the poor man? How
is he to know?'
His yearning for Narendra
"I know these youngsters to be Narayana Himself. At my first meeting with Narendra I
found him completely indifferent to his body. When I touched his chest with my hand,
he lost consciousness of the outer world. Regaining consciousness, Narendra said: 'Oh,
what have you done to me? I have my father and mother at home!' The same thing
happened at Jadu Mallick's house. As the days passed I longed more and more to see
him. My heart yearned for him. One day at that time I said to Bholanath: 'Can you tell
me why I should feel this way? There is a boy called Narendra, of the kayastha caste.
Why should I feel so restless for him?' Bholanath said: 'You will find the explanation in
the Mahabharata. On coming down to the plane of ordinary consciousness, a man
established in samadhi enjoys himself in the company of sattvic people. He feels peace
of mind at the sight of such men.' When I heard this my mind was set at ease. Now and
then I would sit alone and weep for the sight of Narendra.
Reminiscences of his God-intoxicated state
"Oh, what a state of mind I passed through! When I first had that experience, I could not
perceive the coming and going of day or night. People said I was insane. What else
could they say? They made me marry. I was then in a state of God-intoxication. At first
I felt worried about my wife. Then I thought she too would eat and drink and live like
me.
"I visited my father-in-law's house. They arranged a kirtan. It was a great religious
festival, and there was much singing of God's holy name. Now and then I would wonder
about my future. I would say to the Divine Mother, 'Mother, I shall take my spiritual
experiences to be real if the landlords of the country show me respect.' They too came of
their own accord and talked with me.
"Oh, what an ecstatic state it was! Even the slightest suggestion would awaken my
spiritual consciousness. I worshipped the 'Beautiful' in a girl fourteen years old. I saw
that she was the personification of the Divine Mother. At the end of the worship I bowed
before her and offered a rupee at her feet. One day I witnessed a Ramlila performance.
I saw the performers to be the actual Sita, Rāma, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and
Bibhishana. Then I worshipped the actors and actresses who played those parts.
"At that time I used to invite maidens here and worship them. I found them to be
embodiments of the Divine Mother Herself.
"One day I saw a woman in blue standing near the bakul-tree. She was a prostitute.
But she instantly kindled in me the vision of Sita. I forgot the woman. I saw that it was
Sita herself on her way to meet Rāma after her rescue from Ravana in Ceylon. For a
long time I remained in samadhi, unconscious of the outer world.
255"Another day I had gone to the Maidan in Calcutta for fresh air. A great crowd had
assembled there to watch a balloon ascension. Suddenly I saw an English boy leaning
against a tree. As he stood there his body was bent in three places. The vision of
Krishna came before me in a flash. I went into samadhi.
"Once, at Sihore, I fed the cowherd boys. I put sweetmeats into their hands. I saw that
these boys were actually the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, and I partook of the
sweetmeats from their hands.
"At that time I was almost unconscious of thc outer world. Mathur Babu kept me at his
Janbazar mansion a few days. While living there I regarded myself as the handmaid of
the Divine Mother. The ladies of the house didn't feel at all bashful with me. They felt
as free before me as women feel before a small boy or girl. I used to escort Mathur's
daughter to her husband's chamber with the maidservant.
"Even now the slightest thing awakens God-Consciousness in me. Rākhāl used to repeat
the name of God half aloud. At such times I couldn't control myself. It would rouse my
spiritual consciousness and overwhelm me."
Sri Ramakrishna went on describing the different experiences he had had while
worshipping the Divine Mother as Her handmaid. He said: "Once I imitated a
professional woman, singer for a man singer. He said my acting was quite correct and
asked me where I had learnt it." The Master repeated his imitation for the devotees, and
they burst into laughter.
After his noon meal the Master took a short rest. Manilal Mallick, an old member of the
Brahmo Samaj, entered the room and sat down after saluting the Master, who was still
lying on his bed. Manilal asked him questions now and then, and the Master, still half
asleep, answered with a word or two. Manilal said that Shivanath admired Nityagopal's
spiritual state. The Master asked in a sleepy tone what they thought of Hazra.
Then Sri Ramakrishna sat up on his bed and told Manilal about Bhavanath's devotion to
God.
MASTER: "Ah, what an exalted state he is in! He has hardly begun to sing about God
before his eyes fill with tears. The very sight of Harish made him ecstatic. He said that
Harish was very lucky. He made the remark because Harish was spending a few days
here, now and then, away from his home."
Sri Ramakrishna asked M., "Well, what is the cause of bhakti? Why should the spiritual
feeling of young boys like Bhavanath be awakened?" M. remained silent.
MASTER: "The fact is, all men may look alike from the outside, but some of them have
fillings of 'condensed milk'. Cakes may have fillings of condensed milk or powdered
black grams, but they all look alike from the outside. The desire to know God, ecstatic
love of Him, and such other spiritual qualities are the 'condensed milk'."
256Reassurance to the devotees & Parable of the tigress
Sri Ramakrishna spoke reassuringly to the devotees.
MASTER (to M.): "Some think: 'Oh, I am a bound soul. I shall never acquire knowledge
and devotion.' But if one receives the guru's grace, one has nothing to fear. Once a
tigress attacked a flock of goats. As she sprang on her prey, she gave birth to a cub and
died. The cub grew up in the company of the goats. The goats ate grass and the cub
followed their example. They bleated; the cub bleated too. Gradually it grew to be a big
tiger. One day another tiger attacked the same flock. It was amazed to see the grass-
eating tiger. Running after it, the wild tiger at last seized it, whereupon the grass-eating
tiger began to bleat. The wild tiger dragged it to the water and said: 'Look at your face
in the water. It is just like mine. Here is a little meat. Eat it.' Saying this, it thrust
some meat into its mouth. But the grass-eating tiger would not swallow it and began to
bleat again. Gradually, however, it got the taste for blood and came to relish the meat.
Then the wild tiger said: 'Now you see there is no difference between you and me.
Come along and follow me into the forest.'
"So there can be no fear if the guru's grace descends on one. He will let you know who
you are and what your real nature is.
"If the devotee practises spiritual discipline a little, the guru explains everything to him.
Then the disciple understands for himself what is real and what is unreal. God alone is
real, and the world is illusory.
Parable of the false ascetic
"One night a fisherman went into a garden and cast his net into the lake in order to steal
some fish. The owner heard him and surrounded him with his servants. They brought
lighted torches and began to search for him. In the mean time the fisherman smeared
his body with ashes and sat under a tree, pretending to be a holy man. The owner and
his men searched a great deal but could not find the thief. All they saw was a holy man
covered with ashes, meditating under a tree. The next day the news spread in the
neighbourhood that a great sage was staying in the garden. People gathered there and
saluted him with offerings of fruit, flowers, and sweets. Many also offered silver and
copper coins. 'How strange!' thought the fisherman. 'I am not a genuine holy man, and
still people show such devotion to me. I shall certainly realize God if I become a true
sadhu. There is no doubt about it.'
"If a mere pretence of religious life can bring such spiritual awakening, you can imagine
the effect of real sadhana. In that state you will surely realize what is real and what is
unreal. God alone is real, and the world is illusory."
The world is a dream
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The fisherman, to be
sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to those who live in the world?
Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who could see into a man's innermost
257thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an office clerk has been sent to jail. He
undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut
capers in the street? Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as
before. Even after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live
in the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were living
as householders.
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing him,
the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my
Father. Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are
even.' During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night
on the formless God. Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize God if you
have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without form, but your faith
must be sincere and whole-hearted. Sambhu Mallick used to come on foot from
Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a friend said to him: 'It is
risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's
face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set out repeating the name of God! What danger
can befall me?' Through faith alone one attains everything. I used to say, 'I shall take
all this to be true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden
talks to me.' What I would think of would invariably come to pass."
M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that only
superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with actual events.
Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the name of
God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would invariably come to
pass. (To Manilal) But you must remember, unless one is guileless and broad-minded,
one cannot have such faith. Bony people, the hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with
physical traits like those cannot easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil
omens on all sides?"
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and some
other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rākhāl were in the room. The Master was
seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother. There was
complete silence.
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered the room
and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit down. The Master
had known her for many years. In her younger days she had lived a rather immoral life;
but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he began to converse with her.
258MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place, and my
name is inscribed there on a slab."
MASTER: "Indeed!"
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him, touching his
feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up and cried out,
"Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer of the room. He hurried
there, panting, and washed with the holy water the spot the maidservant had touched.
The devotees in the room were amazed to see this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck
dead.
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should salute me from
a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment, the Master said tenderly,
"Listen to a few songs."
The Master then sang about the Divine Mother:
The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet. . . .
Then he sang:
High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring
like a kite,
When came a gust of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly
toward the earth. . . .
Again:
Dwell, O mind, within yourself;
Enter no other's home.
If you but seek there, you will find
All you are searching for.
God, the true Philosopher's Stone,
Who answers every prayer,
259Lies hidden deep within your heart,
The richest gem of all.
How many pearls and precious stones
Are scattered all about
The outer court that lies before
The chamber of your heart!
Tuesday, June 5, 1883
Rākhāl and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at Dakshineswar.
M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a week-day there were
only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered there in large numbers on
Sundays or holidays.
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his experiences during
his God-intoxicated state.
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat my meals
here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at Baranagore or at
Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just sit down there without
saying a word. If the members of the household asked me why I had come, I would
simply say, 'I want something to eat.' Now and then I would go, uninvited of course, to
Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't
relish the food at the Choudhurys' house.
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: 'Devendra
chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?' Mathur Babu was a
very proud man. How could one expect him to go to another man's house uninvited? At
first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right. Devendra and I were fellow students. I
will take you to him.'
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar near the
bridge. He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding me insistent, he
took me to Dina's house in a carriage. It was a small place. The arrival of a rich man in
a big carriage embarrassed the inmates. We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's
son was being invested with the sacred thread. The house was crowded, and there was
hardly any place for Dina to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when
someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really
a distressing situation. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never listen to you
again.' I laughed.
"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the sadhus and
invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When I sat down for
the meal, several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt like leaving them and
sitting alone. I wondered why they should bother about all that. The sadhus took their
seats. I began to eat before they had started. I heard several of them remark, 'Oh!
What sort of man is this?' "
260Parable of the farmer
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of
his verandah. Hazra, Rākhāl, and M. were near him. Hazra had the attitude of a
Vedantist: "I am He."
MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only realizes that it
is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer, the good and the bad, the
real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in waking and in sleep; and that He is
beyond all these.
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced in
age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the farmer
was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son was dangerously
ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the boy dead. His wife wept
bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a
son has passed away, and he hasn't even one tear to shed!' After a long while the
farmer said to his wife: 'Do you know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had
become a king, and the father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as
virtuous. They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts.
Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those
seven children or this one boy.' To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the
dream state.
"God alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will."
Law of karma
HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the sadhu of
Bhukailas. How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They had found him in
samadhi. First they buried him, then they put him under water, and then they branded
him with a hot iron. Thus they brought him back to consciousness of the world. But in
the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures. He undoubtedly suffered at the
hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the will of God."
MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of that
holy man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The kavirajs prepare
makaradhvaja in a bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the fire. The
gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other ingredients, and the medicine is
made. Then the physicians break the bottle carefully and take out the medicine. When
the medicine is made, what difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or
broken? So people think that the holy man was killed. But perhaps his inner stuff had
been made. After the realization of God, what difference does it make whether the body
lives or dies?
Different kinds of samadhi
"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My own
spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of Hrishikesh.
261Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as though it were the
creeping of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of a monkey jumping from
one branch to another. Again, sometimes it feels like a fish swimming in water. Only he
who experiences it knows what it is like. In samadhi one forgets the world. When the
mind comes down a little, I say to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I
want to talk to people.'
"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness after
attaining samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual discipline; but
they do not come back. But when God Himself is born as a man, as an Incarnation,
holding in His hand the key to others' liberation, then for the welfare of humanity the
Incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness of the world."
M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's liberation?"
HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an
Incarnation of God exists or not?"
It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness
enveloped the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the temple
garden. The black sky was reflected in the waters of the Ganges.
The Master went to the verandah south of his room. A spiritual mood was the natural
state of his mind. The dark night of the new moon, associated with the black
complexion of Kali, the Divine Mother, intensified his spiritual exaltation. Now and then
he repeated "Om" and the name of Kali.
He lay down on a mat and whispered to M.
MASTER: "Yes, God can be seen. X- has had a vision of God. But don't tell anyone
about it. Tell me, which do you like better, God with form, or the formless Realitv?"
M: "Sir, nowadays I like to think of God without form. But I am also beginning to
understand that it is God alone who manifests Himself through different forms."
MASTER: "Will you take me in a carriage some day to Mati Seal's garden house at
Belgharia? When you throw puffed rice into the lake there, the fish come to the surface
and eat it. Ah! I feel so happy to see them sport in the water. That will awaken your
spiritual consciousness too. You will feel as if the fish of the human soul were playing in
the Ocean of Satchidananda. In the same manner, I go into an ecstatic mood when I
stand in a big meadow. I feel like a fish released from a bowl into a lake.
"Spiritual discipline is necessary in order to see God. I had to pass through very severe
discipline. How many austerities I practised under the bel-tree! I would lie down under
it, crying to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, reveal Thyself to me.' The tears would flow in
torrents and soak my body."
262M: "You practised so many austerities, but people expect to realize God in a moment!
Can a man build a wall simply by moving his finger around his home?"
MASTER (with a smile): "Amrita says that one man lights a fire and ten bask in its heat.
I want to tell you something else. It is good to remain on the plane of the Lila after
reaching the Nitya."
M: "You once said that one comes down to the plane of the Lila in order to enjoy the
divine play."
MASTER; "No, not exactly that. The Lila is real too.
"Let me tell you something. Whenever you come here, bring a trifle with you. Perhaps I
shouldn't say it; it may look like egotism. I also told Adhar Sen that he should bring a
pennyworth of something with him. I asked Bhavanath to bring a pennyworth of betel-
leaf. Have you noticed Bhavanath's devotion? Narendra and he seem like man and
woman. He is devoted to Narendra. Bring Narendra here with you in a carriage, and
also bring some sweets with you. It will do you good.
Paths of love and knowledge
"Knowledge and love-both are paths leading to God. Those who follow the path of love
have to observe a little more outer purity. But the violation of this by a man following
the path of knowledge cannot injure him. It is destroyed in the fire of knowledge. Even
a banana tree is burnt up when it is thrown into a roaring fire.
"The jnanis follow the path of discrimination. Sometimes it happens that, discriminating
between the Real and the unreal, a man loses his faith in the existence of God. But a
devotee who sincerely yearns for God does not give up his meditation even though he is
invaded by atheistic ideas. A man whose father and. grandfather have been farmers
continues his farming even though he doesn't get any crop in a year of drought."
Lying on the mat and resting his head on a pillow, Sri Ramakrishna continued the
conversation. He said to M: "My legs are aching. Please stroke them gently." Thus, out
of his infinite compassion, the Master allowed his disciple to render him personal service.
June 8, 1883
It was a summer day. The evening service in the Kali temple was over. Sri
Ramakrishna stood before the image of the Divine Mother and waved the fan a few
minutes.
Ram, Kedar Chatterji, and Tarak arrived from Calcutta with flowers and sweets. Kedar
was about fifty years old. At first he had frequented the Brahmo Samaj and joined other
religious sects in his search for God, but later on he had accepted the Master as his
spiritual guide. He was an accountant in a government office and lived in a suburb of
Calcutta.
263Tarak was a young man of twenty-four. His wife had died shortly after their marriage.
He hailed from the village of Barasat not far from Calcutta. His father, a highly spiritual
soul, had visited Sri Ramakrishna many times. Tarak often went to Ram's house and
used to go to Dakshineswar in the company of Ram and Nityagopal. He worked in a
business firm, but his attitude toward the world was one of utter indifference.
As Sri Ramakrishna came out of the temple, he saw Ram, Kedar, M., Tarak, and other
devotees standing outside. He showed his affection for Tarak by touching his chin. He
was very happy to see him.
Returning to his room, the Master sat on the floor in an ecstatic mood, with his legs
stretched before him. Ram and Kedar decorated his feet with flowers and garlands. The
Master was in samadhi.
Master's exhortation to a devotee to go forward
Kedar believed in certain queer practices of a religious sect to which he had once
belonged. He held the Master's big toe in his hand, believing that in this way the
Master's spiritual power would be transmitted to him. As Sri Ramakrishna regained
partial consciousness, he said, "Mother, what can he do to me by holding my toe?" Kedar
sat humbly with folded hands. Still in an ecstatic mood, the Master said to Kedar: "Your
mind is still attracted by 'woman and gold'. What is the use of saying you don't care for
it? Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal-wood there are many more things: mines of
silver, gold, diamonds, and other precious stones. Having a glimpse of spirituality, don't
think you have attained everything." The Master was again in an ecstatic mood. He said
to the Divine Mother, "Mother, take him away." At these words Kedar's throat dried up.
In a frightened tone he said to Ram, "What is the Master saying?"
At the sight of Rākhāl, Sri Ramakrishna was again overpowered with a spiritual mood.
He said to his beloved disciple: "I have been here many days; When did you come?"
Was the Master hinting that he was an Incarnation of God, and Rākhāl his divine
companion, a member of the inner circle of devotees?
Sunday, June 10, 1883
The Master was sitting in his room with Rākhāl, M., Latu, Kishori, Ramlal, Hazra, and
other devotees. It was about ten o'clock in the morning.
Reminiscences of boyhood
Describing his early life, Sri Ramakrishna said to them: "During my younger days the
men and women of Kamarpukur were equally fond of me. They loved to hear me sing. I
could imitate other people's gestures and conversation and I used to entertain them that
way. The women would put aside things for me to eat. No one distrusted me.
Everybody took me in as one of the family.
"But I was like a happy pigeon. I used to frequent only happy families. I would run
away from a place where I saw misery and suffering.
264"One or two young boys of the village were my close friends. I was very intimate with
some of them; but now they are totally immersed in worldliness. A few of them visit me
here now and then and say, 'Goodness! He seems to be just the same as he was in the
village school!' While I was at school, arithmetic would throw me into confusion, but I
could paint very well and could also model small images of the deities.
"I loved to visit the free eating-places maintained for holy men and the poor, and would
watch them for hours.
"I loved to hear the reading of sacred books such as the Ramayana and Bhagavata. If
the readers had any affectations, I could easily imitate them and would entertain others
with my mimicry.
"I understood the behaviour of women very well and imitated their words and
intonations. I could easily recognize immoral women. Immoral widows part their hair in
the middle and perform their toilet with great care. They have very little modesty. The
way they sit is so different! But let's not talk of worldly things any more."
The Master asked Ramlal to sing. Ramlal sang:
Who is this terrible Woman, dark as the sky at midnight?
Who is this Woman dancing over the field of battle.
Like a blue lotus that floats on a crimson sea of blood?
Who is She, clad alone in the Infinite for a garment,
Rolling Her three great eyes in frenzy and savage fury?
Under the weight of Her tread the earth itself is trembling!
Siva, Her mighty Husband, who wields the fearful trident,
Lies like a lifeless corpse beneath Her conquering feet.
The next song described the grief of Mandodari at the death of her husband Ravana. As
he listened to it the Master shed tears of sorrow and said: "Once, when I entered the
pine-grove over there, I heard the boatmen on the Ganges singing that song and wept
bitterly for a long time. I had to be brought back to my room."
Ramlal sang about the love of the gopis for Sri Krishna. Akrura was about to drive Sri
Krishna in a chariot from Vrindavan to Mathura. The gopis would not let Him go. Some
held the wheels of the chariot; some lay down in front of it. They blamed Akrura, not
knowing that Sri Krishna was leaving them of His own will. Akrura was explaining this to
the gopis.
Ramlal sang:
Hold not, hold not the chariot's wheels!
Is it the wheels that make it move?
The Mover of its wheels is Krishna,
By whose will the worlds are moved. . . .
265About the gopis, the Master said: "What deep love, what ecstatic devotion they had for
Krishna! Radha painted the picture of Sri Krishna with her own hand, but did not paint
His legs lest He should run away to Mathura! I used to sing these songs very often
during my boyhood. I could reproduce the whole drama from memory."
After his meal Sri Ramakrishna sat on the couch. He had not yet found time to rest.
The devotees began to assemble. One party arrived from Manirampur and another from
Belgharia. Some of the devotees said, "We have disturbed your rest."
MASTER: "Oh, no! What you say applies only to a rajasic man. About him people say,
'Ah, now he will enjoy his sleep.'"
The devotees from Manirampur asked the Master how to realize God.
MASTER: "You must practise spiritual discipline a little. It will not do simply to say that
milk contains butter. You must let the milk set into curd and then churn it. Only then
can you get butter from it. Spiritual aspirants must go into solitude now and then. After
acquiring love of God in solitude, they may live in the world. If one is wearing a pair of
shoes, one can easily walk over thorns.
"The most important thing is faith.
As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;
And faith is the root of all.
If one has faith one has nothing to fear."
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, is it necessary to have a guru?"
MASTER: "Yes, many need a guru. But a man must have faith in the guru's words. He
succeeds in spiritual life by looking on his guru as God Himself. Therefore the
Vaishnavas speak of Guru, Krishna, and Vaishnava.
"One should constantly repeat the name of God. The name of God is highly effective in
the Kaliyuga. The practice of yoga is not possible in this age, for the life of a man
depends on food. Clap your hands while repeating God's name, and the birds of your sin
will fly away.
"One should always seek the company of holy men. The nearer you approach the
Ganges, the cooler the breeze will feel. Again, the nearer you go to a fire, the hotter the
air will feel.
"But one cannot achieve anything through laziness and procrastination. People who
desire worldly enjoyment say about spiritual progress: 'Well, it will all happen in time.
We shall realize God some time or other.'
266"I said to Keshab Sen: 'When a father sees that his son has become restless for his
inheritance, he gives him his share of the property even three years before the legal
time. A mother keeps on cooking while the baby is in bed sucking its toy. But when it
throws the toy away and cries for her, she puts down the rice-pot and takes the baby in
her arms and nurses it.' I said all this to Keshab.
"It is said that, in the Kaliyuga, if a man can weep for God one day and one night, he
sees Him.
"Feel piqued at God and say to Him: 'You have created me. Now You must reveal
Yourself to me.' Whether you live in the world or elsewhere, always fix your mind on
God. The mind soaked in worldliness may be compared to a wet match-stick. You won't
get a spark, however much you may rub it. Ekalavya placed the clay image of Drona,
his teacher, in front of him and thus learnt archery.
Go forward. The wood-cutter, following the instructions of the holy man, went forward
and found in the forest sandal-wood and mines of silver and gold; and going still farther,
he found diamonds and other precious stones.
"The ignorant are like people living in a house with clay walls. There is very little light
inside, and they cannot see outside at all. But those who enter the world after attaining
the Knowledge of God are like people living in a house made of glass. For them both
inside and outside are light. They can see things outside as well as inside.
"Nothing exists except the One. That One is the Supreme Brahman. So long as He
keeps the 'I' in us, He reveals to us that it is He who, as the Primal Energy, creates,
preserves, and destroys the universe.
"That which is Brahman is also the Primal Energy. Once a king asked a yogi to impart
Knowledge to him in one word. The yogi said, 'All right; you will get Knowledge in one
word.' After a while a magician came to the king. The king saw the magician moving
two of his fingers rapidly and heard him exclaim, 'Behold, O King! Behold.' The king
looked at him amazed when, after a few minutes, he saw the two fingers becoming one.
The magician moved that one finger rapidly and said, 'Behold, O King! Behold.' The
implication of the story is that Brahman and the Primal Energy at first appear to be two.
But after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman one does not see the two. Then there is
no differentiation; it is One, without a second -Advaita-non-duality."
The Master was very happy to see a musician who had come with the devotees from
Belghariā. Some time before, Sri Ramakrishna had gone into an ecstatic mood on
hearing his devotional music. At the Master's request the musician sang a few songs,
one of which described the awakening of the Kundalini and the six centres:
Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep
In the lotus of the Muladhara!
Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother:
Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head,
267Where mighty Siva has His dwelling;
Swiftly pierce the six lotuses
And take away my grief, O Essence of Consciousness!
MASTER: "The song speaks of the Kundalini's passing through the six centres. God is
both within and without. From within He creates the various states of mind. After
passing through the six centres, the jiva goes beyond the realm of maya and becomes
united with the Supreme Soul. This is the vision of God.
"One cannot see God unless maya steps aside from the door. Rāma, Lakshmana, and
Sita were walking together. Rāma was in front, Sita walked in the middle, and
Lakshmana followed them. But Lakshmana could not see Rāma because Sita was
between them. In like manner, man cannot see God because maya is between them.
(To Mani Mallick) But maya steps aside from the door when God shows His grace to the
devotee. When the visitor stands before the door, the door-keeper says to the master,
'Sir, command us, and we shall let him pass.'
"There are two schools of thought: the Vedānta and the Purana. According to the
Vedānta this world is a 'framework of illusion', that is to say, it is all illusory, like a
dream. But according to the Purana, the books of devotion, God Himself has become
the twenty-four cosmic principles. Worship God both within and without.
"As long as God keeps the awareness of 'I' in us, so long do sense-objects exist; and we
cannot very well speak of the world as a dream. There is fire in the hearth; therefore
the rice and pulse and potatoes and the other vegetables jump about in the pot. They
jump about as if to say: 'We are here! We are jumping!' This body is the pot. The mind
and intelligence are the water. The objects of the senses are the rice, potatoes, and
other vegetables. The 'I-consciousness' identified with the senses says, 'I am jumping
about.' And Satchidananda is the fire.
"Hence the Bhakti scriptures describe this very world as a 'mansion of mirth'.
Ramprasad sang in one of his songs, 'This world is a framework of illusion.' Another
devotee gave the reply, 'This very world is a mansion of mirth.' As the saying goes, 'The
devotee of Kali, free while living, is full of Eternal Bliss.' The bhakta sees that He who is
God has also become maya. Again, He Himself has become the universe and all its living
beings. The bhakta sees God, maya, the universe, and the living beings as one. Some
devotees see everything as Rāma: it is Rāma alone who has become everything. Some
see everything as Radha and Krishna. To them it is Krishna alone who has become the
twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like seeing everything green through green glasses.
"But the Bhakti scriptures admit that the manifestations of Power are different in
different beings. It is Rāma who has become everything, no doubt; but He manifests
Himself more in some than in others. There is one kind of manifestation of Rāma in the
Incarnation of God, and another in men. Even the Incarnations are conscious of the
body. Embodiment is due to maya. Rāma wept for Sita. But the Incarnation of God
puts a bondage over His eyes by His own will, like children playing blindman's buff. The
268children stop playing when their mother calls them. It is quite different, however, with
the ordinary man. The cloth his eyes are bandaged with is fastened to his back with
screws, as it were. There are eight fetters. Shame, hatred, fear, caste, lineage, good
conduct, grief, and secretiveness-these are the eight fetters. And they cannot be
unfastened without the help of a guru.
Earnestness in spiritual life extolled
A DEVOTEE : "Sir, please bless us."
MASTER: "God is in all beings. But you must apply to the Gas Company. It will connect
the storage-tank with the pipe in your house.
"One must pray earnestly. It is said that one can realize God by directing to Him the
combined intensity of three attractions, namely, the child's attraction for the mother, the
husband's attraction for the chaste wife, and the attraction of worldly possessions for the
worldly man.
Traits of a true devotee
"There are certain signs by which you can know a true devotee of God. His mind
becomes quiet as he listens to his teacher's instruction, just as the poisonous snake is
quieted by the music of the charmer. I don't mean the cobra. There is another sign. A
real devotee develops the power of assimilating instruction. An image cannot be
impressed on bare glass, but only on glass stained with a black solution, as in
photography. The black solution is devotion to God. There is a third sign of a true
devotee. The true devotee has controlled his senses. He has subdued his lust. The
gopis were free from lust.
"You are talking about your leading a householder's life. Suppose you are a
householder. It rather helps in the practice of spiritual discipline. It is like fighting from
inside a fort. The Tantriks sometimes use a corpse in their religious rites. Now and then
the dead body frightens them by opening its mouth. That is why they keep fried rice
and grams near them, and from time to time they throw some of the grains into the
corpse's mouth. Thus pacifying the corpse, they repeat the name of the Deity without
any worry. Likewise, the householder should pacify his wife and the other members of
his family. He should provide them with food and other necessities. Thus he removes
the obstacles to his practice of spiritual discipline.
"Those who still have a few worldly experiences to enjoy should lead a householder's life
and pray to God. That is why Nityananda allowed the worldly to enjoy catfish soup and
the warm embrace of a young woman while repeating God's name.
"But it is quite different with genuine sannyasis. A bee lights on flowers and on nothing
else. To the chatak all water except rain is tasteless. It will drink no other water, but
looks up agape for the rain that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It drinks
only that water. A real sannyasi will not enjoy any kind of bliss except the Bliss of God.
The bee lights only on flowers. The real monk is like a bee, whereas the householder
devotee is like a common fly, which lights on a festering sore as well as on a sweetmeat.
269"You have taken so much trouble to come here. You must be seeking God. But almost
everyone is satisfied simply by seeing the garden. Only one or two look for its owner.
People enjoy the beauty of the world; they do not seek its Owner.
(Pointing to the singer) "A little while ago he sang a song describing the six centres.
These are dealt with in Yoga. There are two kinds of yoga: hathayoga and rajayoga.
The hathayogi practises physical exercises. His goal is to acquire supernatural powers:
longevity and the eight psychic powers. These are his aims. But the aim of rajayoga is
the attainment of devotion, ecstatic love, knowledge, and renunciation. Of these two,
rajayoga is the better.
Seven planes of the Vedas
"There is much similarity between the seven 'planes' described in the Vedānta and the
six 'centres' of Yoga. The first three planes of the Vedas may be compared to the first
three Yogic centres, namely, Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura. With ordinary
people the mind dwells in these three planes, at the organs of evacuation and generation
and at the navel. When the mind ascends to the fourth plane, the centre designated in
Yoga as Anahata, it sees the individual soul as a flame. Besides, it sees light. At this
the aspirant cries: 'Ah! What is this? Ah! What is this?'
"When the mind rises to the fifth plane, the aspirant wants to hear only about God. This
is the Visuddha centre of Yoga. The sixth plane and the centre known by the yogi as
Ajna are one and the same. When the mind rises there, the aspirant sees God. But still
there is a barrier between God and the devotee. It is like the barrier of glass in a
lantern, which keeps one from touching the light. King Janaka used to give instruction
about Brahmajnana from the fifth plane. Sometimes he dwelt on the fifth plane, and
sometimes on the sixth.
"After passing the six centres the aspirant arrives at the seventh plane. Reaching it, the
mind merges in Brahman. The individual soul and the Supreme Soul become one. The
aspirant goes into samadhi. His consciousness of the body disappears. He loses the
knowledge of the outer world. He does not see the manifold any more. His reasoning
comes to a stop.
"Trailanga Swami once said that because a man reasons he is conscious of multiplicity,
of variety. Attaining samadhi, one gives up the body in twenty-one days. Spiritual
consciousness is not possible without the awakening of the Kundalini.
"A man who has realized God shows certain characteristics. He becomes like a child or a
madman, or an inert thing or a ghoul. Further, he is firmly convinced that he is the
machine and God is its Operator, that God alone is the Doer and all others are His
instruments. As some Sikh devotees once said to me, even the leaf moves because of
God's will. One should be aware that everything happens by the will of Rāma. The
weaver said: 'The price of the cloth, by the will of Rāma, is one rupee six annas. By the
will of Rāma the robbery was committed. By the will of Rāma the robbers were
270arrested. By the will of Rāma I too was arrested by the police. And at last, by the will of
Rāma, I was released.' "
It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna had had no rest since his midday meal. He had talked
unceasingly to the devotees about God. At last the visitors took their leave and went
home.
Friday, June 15, 1883
It was a holiday on account of the Hindu religious festival Dasahara. Among the
devotees who visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar that day were Adhar, M., and
Rākhāl 's father. Rākhāl 's father's father-in-law was also present. All were seated on
the floor of the Master's room.
Advice to householders
Rākhāl 's father's father-in-law was a devotee of God. He asked the Master, "Sir, can
one realize God while leading the life of a householder?"
MASTER (with a smile): "Why not? Live in the world like a mudfish. The mudfish lives in
the mud but itself remains unstained. Or live in the world like a loose woman. She
attends to her household duties, but her mind is always on her sweetheart. Do your
duties in the world, fixing your mind on God. But this is extremely difficult. I said to the
members of the Brahmo Samaj: 'Suppose a typhoid patient is kept in a room where
there are jars of pickles and pitchers of water. How can you expect the patient to
recover? The very thought of spiced pickles brings water to one's mouth.' To a man,
woman is like that pickle. The craving for worldly things, which is chronic in man, is like
the patient's craving for water. There is no end to this craving. The typhoid patient
says, 'I shall drink a whole pitcher of water.' The situation is very difficult. There is so
much confusion in the world. If you go this way, you are threatened with a shovel; if
you go that way, you are threatened with a broomstick; again, in another direction, you
are threatened with a shoe-beating. Besides, one cannot think of God unless one lives in
solitude. The goldsmith melts gold to make ornaments. But how can he do his work
well if he is disturbed again and again? Suppose you are separating rice from bits of
husk. You must do it all by yourself. Every now and then you have to take the rice in
your hand to see how clean it is. But how can you do your work well if you are called
away again and again?"
A DEVOTEE: "What then is the way, sir?"
MASTER: "There is a way. One succeeds if one develops a strong spirit of renunciation.
Give up at once, with determination, what you know to be unreal. Once, when I was
seriously ill, I was taken to the physician Gangaprasad Sen. He said to me: 'I shall give
you a medicine, but you mustn't drink any water. You may take pomegranate juice.'
Everyone wondered how I could live without water; but I was determined not to drink it.
I said to myself: 'I am a paramahamsa and not a goose. I shall drink only milk.'
271"You have to spend a few days in solitude. If you but touch the 'granny' you are safe.
Turn yourself into gold and then live wherever you please. After realizing God and divine
love in solitude one may live in the world as well. (To Rākhāl 's father) That is why I ask
the youngsters to stay with me; for they will develop love of God by staying here a few
days. After that they can very well lead the life of a householder."
Problem of good and evil
DEVOTEE: "If God is responsible for everything, then why should people speak of good
and evil, virtue and vice? One commits sin also by the will of God, isn't that so?"
ANOTHER DEVOTEE: "How can we understand the will of God?"
MASTER: "There is no doubt that virtue and vice exist in the world; but God Himself is
unattached to them. There may be good and bad smells in the air, but the air is not
attached to them. The very nature of God's creation is that good and evil, righteousness
and unrighteousness, will always exist in the world. Among the trees in the garden one
finds mango and jack-fruit, and hog plum too. Haven't you noticed that even wicked
men are needed? Suppose there are rough tenants on an estate; then the landlord must
send a ruffian to control them."
The conversation again turned to the life of the householder.
MASTER (to the devotees): "You see, by leading a householder's life a man needlessly
dissipates his mental powers. The loss he thus incurs can be made up if he takes to
monastic life. The first birth is a gift of the father; then comes the second birth, when
one is invested with the sacred thread. There is still another birth at the time of being
initiated into monastic life. The two obstacles to spiritual life are 'woman' and 'gold'.
Attachment to 'woman' diverts one from the way leading to God. Man doesn't know
what it is that causes his downfall. Once, while going to the Fort, I couldn't see at all
that I was driving down a sloping road; but when the carriage went inside the Fort, I
realized how far down I had come. Alas! Women keep men deluded. Captain says, 'My
wife is full of wisdom.' The man possessed by a ghost does not realize it. He says, 'Why,
I am all right!' "
The devotees listened to these words in deep silence.
MASTER: "It is not lust alone that one should be afraid of in the life of the world. There
is also anger. Anger arises when obstacles are placed in the way of desire."
M: "At meal-time, sometimes a cat stretches out its paw to take the fish from my plate.
But I cannot show any resentment."
MASTER: "Why? You may even beat it once in a while. What's the harm? A worldly man
should hiss, but he shouldn't pour out his venom. He mustn't actually injure others. But
272he should make a show of anger to protect himself from enemies. Otherwise they will
injure him. But a sannyasi need not even hiss."
A DEVOTEE: "I find it is extremely difficult for a householder to realize God. How few
people can lead the life you prescribe for them! I haven't found any."
MASTER: "Why should that be so? I have heard of a deputy magistrate named Pratap
Singh. He is a great man. He has many virtues: compassion and devotion to God. He
meditates on God. Once he sent for me. Certainly there are people like him.
"The practice of discipline is absolutely necessary. Why shouldn't a man succeed if he
practises sadhana? But he doesn't have to work hard if he has real faith-faith in his
guru's words. Once Vyasa was about to cross the Jamuna, when the gopis also arrived
there, wishing to go to the other side. But no ferry-boat was in sight. They said to
Vyasa, 'Revered sir, what shall we do now?' 'Don't worry', said Vyasa. 'I will take you
across. But I am very hungry. Have you anything for me to eat?' The gopis had plenty
of milk, cream, and butter with them. Vyasa ate it all. Then the gopis asked, 'Well, sir,
what about crossing the river?' Vyasa stood on the bank of the Jamuna and said, 'O
Jamuna, if I have not eaten anything today, then may your waters part so that we may
all walk to the other side.' No sooner did the sage utter these words than the waters of
the Jamuna parted. The gopis were speechless with wonder. 'He ate so much just now,'
they said to themselves, 'and he says, "If I have not eaten anything. . ."!' Vyasa had
the firm conviction that it was not himself, but the Narayana who dwelt in his heart, that
had partaken of the food.
"Sankaracharya was a Brahmajnani, to be sure. But at the beginning he too had the
feeling of differentiation. He didn't have absolute faith that everything in the world is
Brahman. One day as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath, he saw an
untouchable, a butcher, carrying a load of meat. Inadvertently the butcher touched his
body. Sankara shouted angrily, 'Hey there! How dare you touch me?' 'Revered sir,' said
the butcher, 'I have not touched you, nor have you touched me. The Pure Self cannot
be the body nor the five elements nor the twenty-four cosmic principles.' Then Sankara
came to his senses. Once Jadabharata was carrying King Rahugana's palanquin and at
the same time giving a discourse on Self-Knowledge. The king got down from the
palanquin and said to Jadabharata, 'Who are you, pray?' The latter answered, 'I am Not
this, not this-I am the Pure Self.' He had perfect faith that he was the Pure Self.
" 'I am He', 'I am the Pure Self'-that is the conclusion of the jnanis. But the bhaktas
say, 'The whole universe is the glory of God.' Who would recognize a wealthy man
without his power and riches? But it is quite different when God Himself, gratified by the
aspirant's devotion, says to him, 'You are the same as Myself.' Suppose a king is seated
in his court, and his cook enters the hall, sits on the throne, and says, 'O King, you and I
are the same!' People will certainly call him a madman. But suppose one day the king,
pleased with the cook's service, says to him: 'Come, sit beside me. There is nothing
wrong in that. There is no difference between you and me.' Then, if the cook sits on the
273throne with the king, there is no harm in it. It is not good for ordinary people to say, 'I
am He'. The waves belong to the water. Does the water belong to the waves?
Result of yoga through bhakti
"The upshot of the whole thing is that, no matter what path you follow, yoga is
impossible unless the mind becomes quiet. The mind of a yogi is under his control; he is
not under the control of his mind. When the mind is quiet the prana stops functioning.
Then one gets kumbhaka. One may have the same kumbhaka through bhaktiyoga as
well; the prana stops functioning through love of God too. In the kirtan the musician
sings, 'Nitai amar mata hati!' Repeating this, he goes into a spiritual mood and cannot
sing the whole sentence. He simply sings, 'Hati! Hati' When the mood deepens he sings
only, 'Ha! Ha!' Thus his prana stops through ecstasy, and kumbhaka follows.
"Suppose a man is sweeping a courtyard with his broom, and another man comes and
says to him: 'Hello! So-and-so is no more. He is dead.' Now, if the dead person was not
related to the sweeper, the latter goes on with his work, remarking casually: 'Ah! That's
too bad. He is dead. He was a good fellow.' The sweeping goes on all the same. But if
the dead man was his relative, then the broom drops from his hand. 'Ah!' he exclaims,
and he too drops to the ground. His prana has stopped functioning. He can neither
work nor think. Haven't you noticed, among women, that if one of them looks at
something or listens to something in speechless amazement, the other women say to
her, 'What? Are you in ecstasy?' In this instance, too, the prana has stopped functioning,
and so she remains speechless, with mouth agape.
"It will not do merely to repeat, 'I am He, I am He.' There are certain signs of a Jnāni.
Narendra has big protruding eyes. (Pointing to a devotee) He also has good eyes and
forehead.
Different classes of men
"All men are by no means on the same level. It is said that there are four classes of
men: the bound, the struggling, the liberated, and the ever-free. It is also not a fact
that all men have to practise spiritual discipline. There are the ever-free and those who
achieve perfection through spiritual discipline. Some realize God after much spiritual
austerity, and some are perfect from their very birth. Prahlada is an example of the
ever-free.
"Eternally perfect sages like Prahlada also practise meditation and prayer. But they have
realized the fruit, God-vision, even before their spiritual practice. They are like gourds
and pumpkins, which grow fruit first and then flowers.
(Looking at Rākhāl 's father) "Even though an eternally perfect soul is born in a low
family, still he retains his innate perfection. He cannot do anything else. A pea
germinating in a heap of cow-dung still grows into a pea-plant.
"God has given to some greater power than to others. In one man you see it as the light
of a lamp, in another, as the light of a torch. One word of Vidyasagar's revealed to me
the utmost limit of his intelligence. When I told him of the different manifestations of
274God's Power in different beings, he said to me, 'Sir, has God then given greater power to
some than to others?' At once I said: 'Yes, certainly He has; If there are not different
degrees of manifestation of His Power, then why should your name be known far and
wide? You see, we have come to you after hearing of your knowledge and compassion.
You haven't grown two horns, have you?' With all his fame and erudition, Vidyasagar
said such a childish thing as 'Has God given greater power to some than to others?' The
truth is that when the fisherman draws his net, he first catches big fish like trout and
carp; then he stirs up the mud with his feet, and small fish come out-minnows, mud-
fish, and so on. So also, unless a man knows God, 'minnows' and the like gradually
come out from within him. What can one achieve through mere scholarship?"
Sunday, June 17, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room in the temple garden at Dakshineswar. It was
afternoon. Adhar and M. arrived and saluted the Master. A Tantrik devotee also came
in. Rākhāl , Hazra, and Ramlal were staying with Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER (to the devotees): "Why shouldn't one be able to attain spirituality, living the
life of a householder? But it is extremely difficult. Sages like Janaka entered the world
after attaining Knowledge. But still the world is a place of terror. Even a detached
householder has to be careful. Once Janaka bent down his head at the sight of a
bhairavi. He shrank from seeing a woman. The bhairavi said to him: 'Janaka, I see you
have not yet attained Knowledge. You still differentiate between man and woman.'
"If you move about in a room filled with soot, you will soil your body, however slightly,
no matter how clever you may be. I have seen householder devotees filled with spiritual
emotion while performing their daily worship wearing their silk clothes. They maintain
that attitude even until they take their refreshments after the worship. But afterwards
they become their old selves again. They display their rajasic and tamasic natures.
"Sattva begets bhakti. Even bhakti has three aspects: sattva, rajas, and tamas. The
sattva of bhakti is pure sattva. When a devotee acquires it he doesn't direct his mind to
anything but God. He pays only as much attention to his body as is absolutely necessary
for its protection.
"But a paramahamsa is beyond the three gunas. Though they exist in him, yet they are
practically non-existent. Like a child, he is not under the control of any of the gunas.
That is why paramahamsas allow small children to come near them- in order to assume
their nature.
"Paramahamsas may not lay things up; but this rule does not apply to householders.
They must provide for their families."
TANTRIK DEVOTEE: "Is a paramahamsa aware of virtue and vice?"
MASTER: "Keshab Sen also asked that question. I said to him, 'If I explain that to you,
then you won't be able to keep your society together.' 'In that case we had better stop
here', said Keshab.
275"Do you know the significance of virtue and vice? A paramahamsa sees that it is God
who gives us evil tendencies as well as good tendencies. Haven't you noticed that there
are both sweet and bitter fruits? Some trees give sweet fruit, and some bitter or sour.
God has made the mango-tree, which yields sweet fruit, and also the hog plum, which
yields sour fruit."
TANTRIK: "Yes, sir. That is true. On the hill-top one sees extensive rose gardens,
reaching as far as the eye can see."
MASTER: "The paramahamsa realizes that all these-good and bad, virtue and vice, real
and unreal-are only the glories of God's maya. But these are very deep thoughts. One
realizing this cannot keep an organization together or anything like that."
TANTRIK: "But the law of karma exists, doesn't it?"
MASTER: "That also is true. Good produces good, and bad produces bad. Don't you get
the hot taste if you eat chillies? But these are all God's lila, His play."
TANTRIK: "Then what is the way for us? We shall have to reap the result of our past
karma, shall we not?"
MASTER: "That may be so. But it is different with the devotees of God. Listen to a
song:
O mind, you do not know how to farm!
Fallow lies the field of your life.
If you had only worked it well,
How rich a harvest you might reap!
Hedge it about with Kali's name
If you would keep your harvest safe;
This is the stoutest hedge of all,
For Death himself cannot come near it.
Sooner or later will dawn the day
When you must forfeit your precious field;
Gather, O mind, what fruit you may.
Sow for your seed the holy name
Of God that your guru has given to you,
Faithfully watering it with love;
And if you should find the task too hard,
Call upon Ramprasad for help.
He sang again:
I have securely blocked the way by which the King of Death
will come;
Henceforward all my doubts and fears are set at naught for
276ever.
Siva Himself is standing guard at the nine doorways of my
house,
Which has one Pillar for support, and three ropes to secure it.
The Lord has made His dwelling-place the thousand-petalled
lotus flower
Within the head, and comforts me with never-ceasing care.
The Master continued: "Anyone who dies in Benares, whether a brahmin or a prostitute,
will become Siva. When a man sheds tears at the name of Hari, Kali, or Rāma, then he
has no further need of the sandhya and other rites. All actions drop away of
themselves. The fruit of action does not touch him."
Again the Master sang:
As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;
And faith is the root of all.
If in the Nectar Lake of Mother Kali's feet
My mind remains immersed,
Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.
He sang another song:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or
Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kali's name upon my
lips?..
Then he said, "When a man merges himself in God, he can no longer retain wicked or
sinful tendencies."
TANTRIK: "You have said rightly that he keeps only the 'Knowledge ego'."
MASTER: "Yes, he keeps only the 'Knowledge ego', the 'devotee ego', the 'servant ego',
and the 'good ego'. His 'wicked ego' disappears."
TANTRIK: "Today you have destroyed many of our doubts."
MASTER: "All doubts disappear when one realizes the Self.
"Assume the tamasic aspect of bhakti. Say with force: 'What? I have uttered the names
of Rāma and Kali. How can I be in bondage any more? How can I be affected by the law
of karma?' "

The Master sang:
If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name,
How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,
Withhold from me deliverance,
277Wretched though I may be?
I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,
Or slain a woman or a cow,
Or even caused a brahmin's death;
But, though it all be true,
Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;
For through the power of Thy sweet name
My wretched soul may still aspire
Even to Brahmanhood.
The Master continued: "Faith! Faith! Faith! Once a guru said to his pupil, 'Rāma alone
has become everything.' When a dog began to eat the pupil's bread, he said to it: 'O
Rāma, wait a little. I shall butter Your bread.' Such was his faith in the words of his
guru.
"Worthless people do not have any faith. They always doubt.
disappear completely till one realizes the Self.
But doubts do not
"In genuine love of God there is no desire. Only through such love does one speedily
realize God. Attainment of supernatural powers and so on- these are desires. Krishna
once said to Arjuna: 'Friend, you cannot realize God if you acquire even one of the eight
supernatural powers. They will only add a little to your power.' "
TANTRIK: "Sir, why don't the rituals of Tantra bear fruit nowadays?"
MASTER: "It is because people cannot practise them with absolute correctness and
devotion."
In conclusion the Master said: "Love of God is the one essential thing. A true lover of
God has nothing to fear, nothing to worry about. He is aware that the Divine Mother
knows everything. The cat handles the mouse one way, but its own kitten a very
different way."
