## Master's visit to Brahmo festival

SRI RAMAKRISHNA paid a visit to Benimadhav Pal's garden house at Sinthi, near Calcutta, on the occasion of the semi-annual festival of the Brahmo Samaj. Many
devotees of the Samaj were present and sat around the Master. 

Now and then some of them asked him questions.


## Love and prayer

{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
Sir, what is the way?
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "Attachment to God, or, in other words, love for Him. And secondly, prayer."

{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
Which one is the way-love or prayer?"
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "First love, and then prayer."

The Master sang:
Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, O mind!
And how can She hold Herself from you?
How can Syama stay away? . . .
Continuing, the Master said: "And one must always chant the name and glories of God
and pray to Him. An old metal pot must be scrubbed every day. What is the use of
cleaning it only once? Further, one must practise discrimination and renunciation; one
must be conscious of the unreality of the world."
BRAHMO: "Is it good to renounce the world?"
MASTER: "Not for all. Those who have not yet come to the end of their enjoyments
should not renounce the world. Can one get drunk on two ānnās ' worth of wine?"
How to lead a householder's life
BRAHMO: "Then should they lead a worldly life?"
MASTER: "Yes, they should try to perform their duties in a detached way. Before you
break the jack-fruit open, rub your hands with oil, so that the sticky milk will not smear
them. The maidservant in a rich man's house performs all her duties, but her mind
dwells on her home in the country. This is an example of doing duty in a detached way.
You should renounce the world only in mind. But a sannyasi should renounce the world
both inwardly and outwardly."
BRAHMO: "What is the meaning of the 'end of enjoyments'?"
MASTER: "I mean the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'. It is risky to put a typhoid
patient in a room where pitchers of water and jugs of pickled tamarind are kept. Most
237people don't feel any longing for God unless they have once passed through the
experience of wealth, name, fame, creature comforts, and the like, that is to say, unless
they have seen through these enjoyments."

{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
Who is really bad, man or woman?
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "There are women endowed with vidyaŚakti. There are also women with avidyaŚakti. 

A woman endowed with spiritual attributes leads a man to God, but a woman who is the embodiment of delusion makes him forget God and drowns him in the
ocean of worldliness.

This universe is created by the Mahamaya of God. Mahamaya contains both Vidyā-māyā, the illusion of knowledge, and Avidyā-māyā, the illusion of ignorance. Through
the help of Vidyā-māyā one cultivates such virtues as the taste for holy company, knowledge, devotion, love, and renunciation. Avidyā-māyā consists of the five elements
and the objects of the five senses- form, flavour, smell, touch, and sound. These make
one forget God." 


{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
If the power of avidyā is the cause of ignorance, then why has God created it?"
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "That is His play. The glory of light cannot be appreciated without darkness.
Happiness cannot be understood without misery. Knowledge of good is possible because
of knowledge of evil.

"Further, the mango grows and ripens on account of the covering skin. You throwaway
the skin when the mango is fully ripe and ready to be eaten. It is possible for a man to
attain gradually to the Knowledge of Brahman because of the covering skin of maya.
Maya in its aspects of vidyā and avidyā may be likened to the skin of the mango. Both
are necessary."


{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
Is it good to worship God with form, an image of the Deity made of clay?"
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "You do not accept God with form. That is all right. The image is not meant for you. For you it is good to deepen your feeling toward your own Ideal. From the
worshippers of the Personal God you should learn their yearning-for instance, Sri Krishna's attraction for Radha. You should learn from the worshippers of the Personal
God their love for their Chosen Ideal. When the believers in the Personal God worship
the images of Kāli and Durga, with what feeling they cry from the depths of their souls,
'Mother! O Mother!' How much they love the Deity! You should accept that feeling. You
don't have to accept the image."

{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
How does one cultivate the spirit of dispassion? Why don't all attain it?"
{{< /r >}}


MASTER: "Dispassion is not possible unless there is satiety through enjoyment. You can
easily cajole a small child with candies or toys. But after eating the candies and finishing
238its play, it cries, 'I want to go to my mother.' Unless you take the child to its mother, it
will throw away the toy and scream at the top of its voice."
The members of the Brahmo Samaj are opposed to the traditional guru system of
orthodox Hinduism. Therefore the Brahmo devotee asked the Master about it.
The need of a guru

{{< r a="Brahmo-Devotee" >}}
Is spiritual knowledge impossible without a guru?"
{{< /r >}}

MASTER: "Satchidananda alone is the Guru. If a man in the form of a guru awakens spiritual consciousness in you, then know for certain that it is God the Absolute who has
assumed that human form for your sake. The guru is like a companion who leads you by the hand. 

After the realization of God, one loses the distinction between the guru and the disciple. 'That creates a very difficult situation; there the guru and the disciple do
not see each other.' It was for this reason that Janaka said to Sukadeva, 'Give me first my teacher's fee if you want me to initiate you into the Knowledge of Brahman.' For the distinction between the teacher and the disciple ceases to exist after the disciple attains
to Brahman. The relationship between them remains as long as the disciple does not
see God."

It was dusk. Some of the Brahmo devotees said to the Master, "Perhaps it is time for your evening devotions."


MASTER: "No, it isn't exactly that. One should pass through these disciplines in the
beginning. Later one doesn't need the rituals of formal worship or to follow the
injunctions."
After dusk the preacher of the Brahmo Samaj conducted the service from the pulpit.
The service was interspersed with recitations from the Upanishads and the singing of
Brahmo songs.
After the service the Master and the preacher conversed.

Personal God and formless Deity

MASTER: "Well, it seems to me that both the formless Deity and God with form are real.
What do you say?"

PREACHER: "Sir, I compare the formless God to the electric current, which is not seen
with the eyes but can be felt."

MASTER: "Yes, both are true. God with form is as real as God without form. Do you know what describing God as being formless only is like? It is like a man's playing only a
monotone on his flute, though it has seven holes. But on the same instrument another
man plays different melodies. Likewise, in how many ways the believers in a Personal
God enjoy Him! They enjoy Him through many different attitudes: the serene attitude,
the attitude of a servant, a friend, a mother, a husband, or a lover.

"You see, the thing is somehow or other to get into the Lake of the Nectar of Immortality. Suppose one person gets into It by propitiating the Deity with hymns and worship, and you are pushed into It. The result will be the same. Both of you will
certainly become immortal.

"I give the Brahmos the illustration of water and ice. Satchidananda is like an endless expanse of water. The water of the great ocean in cold regions freezes into blocks of
ice. Similarly, through the cooling influence of divine love, Satchidananda assumes forms for the sake of the bhaktas. The rishis had the vision of the supersensuous Spirit-
form and talked with It. But devotees acquire a 'love body', and with its help they see
the Spirit-form of the Absolute.

"It is also said in the Vedas that Brahman is beyond mind and words. The heat of the
sun of Knowledge melts the ice-like form of the Personal God. On attaining the
Knowledge of Brahman and communing with It in nirvikalpa samādhi, one realizes
Brahman, the Infinite, without form or shape and beyond mind and words.
God's true nature cannot be described "The nature of Brahman cannot be described. About It one remains silent. Who can
explain the Infinite in words? However high a bird may soar, there are regions higher
still. What do you say?"

PREACHER: "Yes, sir, it is so stated in the Vedanta philosophy."

MASTER: "Once a salt doll went to the ocean to measure its depth. But it could not come back to give a report. According to one school of thought, sages like Sukadeva
saw and touched the Ocean of Brahman, but did not plunge into It. 

"Once I said to Vidyasagar, 'Everything else but Brahman has been polluted, as it were, like food touched by the tongue.' In other words, no one has been able to describe what
Brahman is. A thing once uttered by the tongue becomes polluted. Vidyasagar, great
pundit though he was, was highly pleased with my remarks.
"It is said that there are places near Kedār that are covered with eternal snow; he who
climbs too high cannot come back. Those who have tried to find out what there is in the
higher regions, or what one feels there, have not come back to tell us about it.
"After having the vision of God man is overpowered with bliss. He becomes silent. Who
will speak? Who will explain?
"The king lives beyond seven gates. At each gate sits a man endowed with great power
and glory. At each gate the visitor asks, 'Is this the king?' The gate-keeper answers,
'No. Not this, not this.' The visitor passes through the seventh gate and. becomes
overpowered with joy. He is speechless. This time he doesn't have to ask, 'Is this the
king?' The mere sight of him removes all doubts."
PREACHER: "Yes, sir, it is so described in Vedanta."
240MASTER: "When the Godhead is thought of as creating, preserving, and destroying, It is
known as the Personal God, Saguna Brahman, or the Primal Energy, Ādyāśakti . Again,
when It is thought of as beyond the three gunas, then It is called the Attributeless
Reality, Nirguna Brahman, beyond speech and thought; this is the Supreme Brahman,
Parabrahman.


## The three gunas

Under the spell of God's maya man forgets his true nature. He forgets that he is heir to the infinite glories of his Father. This divine maya is made up of three gunas. And all 3 are robbers; for they rob man of all his treasures and make him forget his true
nature. The three gunas are sattva, rajas, and tamas. Of these, sattva alone points the
way to God. But even sattva cannot take a man to God.

Parable of the three robbers

Once a rich man was robbed by 3 robbers.

`Robber 1` said: 'What's the good of keeping the man alive? Kill him.' 
- This is tamas. It destroys.
`Robber 2` said: 'There's no use in killing him. Let us bind him and leave him here. Then he won't be able to tell the police.' They left. 
- This is rajas, which binds a man to the world and entangles him in a variety of activities. Rajas makes him forget God.
`Robber 3` returned to the rich man and said: 'You're badly hurt. I will release you. Follow that road and you will reach home easily.'

<!--  The third robber set the man free and led him out of the forest. When .they came near the highway, the robber said, '' 'But you must come with me too', said the man.
'You have done so much for me. We shall all be happy to see you at our home.' 
'No,'  said the robber, 'it is not possible for me to go there. The police will arrest me.' -->

- This is Sattva which alone shows the way to God. It produces virtues like compassion, righteousness, and devotion.
- Sattva is like the last step of the stairs. Next to it is the roof.

The Supreme Brahman is man's own abode. One cannot attain the Knowledge of Brahman unless one transcends the three gunas.


MASTER (with a smile): "Do you know the nature of devotees? When one devotee meets
another, he says, 'Let me speak and you listen; and when you speak I shall listen.' You
are a preacher and teach so many people! You are a steamship, and I am a mere
fishing-boat.' (All laugh.)
