PREFACE

by Swāmi Nikhilānanda

The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is the English translation of the
Kathāmrita,

Sri Sri Rāmakrishna

the conversations of Sri Ramakrishna with his disciples, devotees, and
visitors, recorded by Mahendranāth Gupta, who wrote the book under the pseudonym of
"M." The conversations in Bengali fill five volumes, the first of which was published in
1897 and the last shortly after M.'s death in 1932. Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, has
published in two volumes an English translation of selected chapters from the
monumental Bengali work. I have consulted these while preparing my translation.
M., one of the intimate disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, was present during all the
conversations recorded in the main body of the book and noted them down in his diary.
They therefore have the value of almost stenographic records. In Appendix A are given
several conversations which took place in the absence of M., but of which he received a
first-hand record from persons concerned. The conversations will bring before the
reader's mind an intimate picture of the Master's eventful life from March 1882 to April
24, 1886, only a few months before his passing away. During this period he came in
contact chiefly with English-educated Bengālis; from among them he selected his
disciples and the bearers of his message, and with them he shared his rich spiritual
experiences.

I have made a literal translation, omitting only a few pages of no particular interest to
English-speaking readers. Often literary grace has been sacrificed for the sake of literal
translation. No translation can do full justice to the original. This difficulty is all the
more felt in the present work, whose contents are of a deep mystical nature and
describe the inner experiences of a great seer. Human language is an altogether
inadequate vehicle to express supersensuous perception. Sri Ramakrishna was almost
illiterate. He never clothed his thoughts in formal language. His words sought to convey
his direct realization of Truth. His conversation was in a village patois. Therein lies its
charm. In order to explain to his listeners an abstruse philosophy, he, like Christ before
him, used with telling effect homely parables and illustrations, culled from his
observation of the daily life around him.
The reader will find mentioned in this work many visions and experiences that fall
outside the ken of physical science and even psychology. With the development of
modern knowledge the border line between the natural and the supernatural is ever
shifting its position. Genuine mystical experiences are not as suspect now as they were
half a century ago. The words of Sri Ramakrishna have already exerted a tremendous
influence in the land of his birth. Savants of Europe have found in his words the ring of
universal truth.
But these words were not the product of intellectual cogitation; they were rooted in
direct experience. Hence, to students of religion, psychology, and physical science,
these experiences of the Master are of immense value for the understanding of religious
4phenomena in general. No doubt Sri Ramakrishna was a Hindu of the Hindus; yet his
experiences transcended the limits of the dogmas and creeds of Hinduism. Mystics of
religions other than Hinduism will find in Sri Ramakrishna's experiences a corroboration
of the experiences of their own prophets and seers. And this is very important today for
the resuscitation of religious values. The sceptical reader may pass by the supernatural
experiences; he will yet find in the book enough material to provoke his serious thought
and solve many of his spiritual problems.
There are repetitions of teachings and parables in the book. I have kept them
purposely. They have their charm and usefulness, repeated as they were in different
settings. Repetition is unavoidable in a work of this kind. In the first place, different
seekers come to a religious teacher with questions of more or less identical nature;
hence the answers will be of more or less identical pattern. Besides, religious teachers
of all times and climes have tried, by means of repetition, to hammer truths into the
stony soil of the recalcitrant human mind. Finally, repetition does not seem tedious if
the ideas repeated are dear to a man's heart.
I have thought it necessary to write a rather lengthy Introduction to the book. In it I
have given the biography of the Master, descriptions of people who came in contact with
him, short explanations of several systems of Indian religious thought intimately
connected with Sri Ramakrishna's life, and other relevant matters which, I hope, will
enable the reader better to understand and appreciate the unusual contents of this
book. It is particularly important that the Western reader, unacquainted with Hindu
religious thought, should first read carefully the introductory chapter, in order that he
may fully enjoy these conversations. Many Indian terms and names have been retained
in the book for want of suitable English equivalents. Their meaning is given either in the
Glossary or in the foot-notes. The Glossary also gives explanations of a number of
expressions unfamiliar to Western readers. The diacritical marks are explained under
Notes on Pronunciation.
In the Introduction I have drawn much material from the Life of Sri Ramakrishna,
published by the Advaita Ashrama, Māyāvati, India. I have also consulted the excellent
article on Sri Ramakrishna by Swami Nirvedānanda, in the second volume of the Cultural
Heritage of India.
The book contains many songs sung either by the Master or by the devotees. These
form an important feature of the spiritual tradition of Bengal and were for the most part
written by men of mystical experience. For giving the songs their present form I am
grateful to Mr. John Moffitt, Jr.
In the preparation of this manuscript I have received ungrudging help from several
friends. Miss Margaret Woodrow Wilson and Mr.Joseph Campbell have worked hard in
editing my translation. Mrs.Elizabeth Davidson has typed, more than once, the entire
manuscript and rendered other valuable help. Mr.Aldous Huxley has laid me under a
debt of gratitude by writing the Foreword. I sincerely thank them all.
5In the spiritual firmament Sri Ramakrishna is a waxing crescent. Within one hundred
years of his birth and fifty years of his death his message has spread across land and
sea. Romain Rolland has described him as the fulfilment of the spiritual aspirations of
the three hundred millions of Hindus for the last two thousand years. Mahatma Gandhi
has written: "His life enables us to see God face to face. . . . Ramakrishna was a living
embodiment of godliness." He is being recognized as a compeer of Krishna, Buddha, and
Christ.
The life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna have redirected the thoughts of the
denationalized Hindus to the spiritual ideals of their forefathers. During the latter part of
the nineteenth century his was the time-honoured role of the Saviour of the Eternal
Religion of the Hindus. His teachings played an important part in liberalizing the minds
of orthodox pundits and hermits. Even now he is the silent force that is moulding the
spiritual destiny of India. His great disciple, Swami Vivekananda, was the first Hindu
missionary to preach the message of Indian culture to the enlightened minds of Europe
and America. The full consequence of Swami Vivekānandā work is still in the womb of
the future.
May this translation of the first book of its kind in the religious history of the world, being
the record of the direct words of a prophet, help stricken humanity to come nearer to the
Eternal Verity of life and remove dissension and quarrel from among the different faiths!
May it enable seekers of Truth to grasp the subtle laws of the supersensuous realm, and
unfold before man's restricted vision the spiritual foundation of the universe, the unity of
existence, and the divinity of the soul!

6The Recorder of the Gospel

MAHENDRANĀTH GUPTA
In the life of the great Saviours and Prophets of the world it is often found that they are
accompanied by souls of high spiritual potency who play a conspicuous part in the
furtherance of their Master's mission. They become so integral a part of the life and work
of these great ones that posterity can think of them only in mutual association. Such is
the case with Sri Ramakrishna and M., whose diary has come to be known to the world
as the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English and as Sri Rāmakrishna Kathāmrita in
the original Bengali version.
Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, familiary known to the readers of the Gospel by his pen name
M., and to the devotees as Master Mahashay, was born on the 14th of July, 1854 as the
son of Madhusudan Gupta, an officer of the Calcutta High Court, and his wife,
Swarnamayi Devi. He had a brilliant scholastic career at Hare School and the Presidency
College at Calcutta. The range of his studies included the best that both occidental and
oriental learning had to offer. English literature, history, economics, western philosophy
and law on the one hand, and Sanskrit literature and grammar, Darsanas, Puranas,
Smritis, Jainism, Buddhism, astrology and Ayurveda on the other were the subjects in
which he attained considerable proficiency.
He was an educationist all his life both in a spiritual and in a secular sense. After he
passed out of College, he took up work as headmaster in a number of schools in
succession Narail High School, City School, Ripon College School, Metropolitan School,
Aryan School, Oriental School, Oriental Seminary and Model School. The causes of his
migration from school to school were that he could not get on with some of the
managements on grounds of principles and that often his spiritual mood drew him away
to places of pilgrimage for long periods. He worked with some of the most noted public
men of the time like Iswar Chandra Vidyāsāgar and Surendranath Banerjee. The latter
appointed him as a professor in the City and Ripon Colleges where he taught subjects
like English, philosophy, history and economics. In his later days he took over the
Morton School, and he spent his time in the staircase room of the third floor of it,
administering the school and preaching the message of the Master. He was much
respected in educational circles where he was usually referred to as Rector Mahashay. A
teacher who had worked under him writes thus in warm appreciation of his teaching
methods: "Only when I worked with him in school could I appreciate what a great
educationist he was. He would come down to the level of his students when teaching,
though he himself was so learned, so talented. Ordinarily teachers confine their
instruction to what is given in books without much thought as to whether the student
can accept it or not. But M., would first of all gauge how much the student could take in
and by what means. He would employ aids to teaching like maps, pictures and diagrams,
so that his students could learn by seeing. Thirty years ago (from 1953) when the
question of imparting education through the medium of the mother tongue was being
7discussed, M. had already employed Bengali as the medium of instruction in the Morton
School." (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda Part I. P. 15.)
Imparting secular education was, however, only his profession ; his main concern was
with the spiritual regeneration of man a calling for which Destiny seems to have chosen
him. From his childhood he was deeply pious, and he used to be moved very much by
Sādhus, temples and Durga Puja celebrations. The piety and eloquence of the great
Brahmo leader of the times, Keshab Chander Sen, elicited a powerful response from the
impressionable mind of Mahendra Nath, as it did in the case of many an idealistic young
man of Calcutta, and prepared him to receive the great Light that was to dawn on him
with the coming of Sri Ramakrishna into his life.
This epoch-making event of his life came about in a very strange way. M. belonged to a
joint family with several collateral members. Some ten years after he began his career
as an educationist, bitter quarrels broke out among the members of the family, driving
the sensitive M. to despair and utter despondency. He lost all interest in life and left
home one night to go into the wide world with the idea of ending his life. At dead of
night he took rest in his sister's house at Baranagar, and in the morning, accompanied
by a nephew Siddheswar, he wandered from one garden to another in Calcutta until
Siddheswar brought him to the Temple Garden of Dakshineswar where Sri Ramakrishna
was then living. After spending some time in the beautiful rose gardens there, he was
directed to the room of the Paramahamsa, where the eventful meeting of the Master and
the disciple took place on a blessed evening (the exact date is not on record) on a
Sunday in March 1882. As regards what took place on the occasion, the reader is
referred to the opening section of the first chapter of the
Gospel.
The Master, who divined the mood of desperation in M, his resolve to take leave of this
'play-field of deception', put new faith and hope into him by his gracious words of
assurance: "God forbid! Why should you take leave of this world? Do you not feel
blessed by discovering your Guru? By His grace, what is beyond all imagination or
dreams can be easily achieved!" At these words the clouds of despair moved away from
the horizon of M.'s mind, and the sunshine of a new hope revealed to him fresh vistas of
meaning in life. Referring to this phase of his life, M. used to say, "Behold! where is the
resolve to end life, and where, the discovery of God! That is, sorrow should be looked
upon as a friend of man. God is all good." (Ibid P.33.)
After this re-settlement, M's life revolved around the Master, though he continued his
professional work as an educationist. During all holidays, including Sundays, he spent his
time at Dakshineswar in the Master's company, and at times extended his stay to
several days.
8It did not take much time for M. to become very intimate with the Master, or for the
Master to recognise in this disciple a divinely commissioned partner in the fulfilment of
his spiritual mission. When M. was reading out the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the Master
discovered that he had been, in a previous birth, a disciple and companion of the great
Vaishnava Teacher, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the Master even saw him 'with his
naked eye' participating in the ecstatic mass-singing of the Lord's name under the
leadership of that Divine personality. So the Master told M, "You are my own, of the
same substance as the father and the son," indicating thereby that M. was one of the
chosen few and a part and parcel of his Divine mission.
There was an urge in M. to abandon the household life and become a Sannyāsin. When
he communicated this idea to the Master, he forbade him saying," Mother has told me
that you have to do a little of Her work you will have to teach Bhagavata, the word of
God to humanity. The Mother keeps a Bhagavata Pandit with a bondage in the world!"
(Ibid P.36.)
An appropriate allusion indeed! Bhagavata, the great scripture that has given the word
of Sri Krishna to mankind, was composed by the Sage Vyāsa under similar
circumstances. When caught up in a mood of depression like that of M, Vyāsa was
advised by the sage Nārada that he would gain peace of mind only qn composing a work
exclusively devoted to the depiction of the Lord's glorious attributes and His teachings on
Knowledge and Devotion, and the result was that the world got from Vyāsa the
invaluable gift of the Bhagavata Purana depicting the life and teachings of Sri Krishna.
From the mental depression of the modem Vyāsa, the world has obtained the
Kathāmrita (Bengali Edition) the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English.
Sri Ramakrishna was a teacher for both the Orders of mankind, Sannyāsins and
householders. His own life offered an ideal example for both, and he left behind disciples
who followed the highest traditions he had set in respect of both these ways of life. M.,
along with Nag Mahashay, exemplified how a householder can rise to the highest level of
sagehood. M. was married to Nikunja Devi, a distant relative of Keshab Chander Sen,
even when he was reading at College, and he had four children, two sons and two
daughters. The responsibility of the family, no doubt, made him dependent on his
professional income, but the great devotee that he was, he never compromised with
ideals and principles for this reason. Once when he was working as the headmaster in a
school managed by the great Vidyāsāgar, the results of the school at the public
examination happened to be rather poor, and Vidyāsāgar attributed it to M's pre-
occupation with the Master and his consequent failure to attend adequately to the school
work. M. at once resigned his post without any thought of the morrow. Within a fortnight
the family was in poverty, and M. was one day pacing up and down the verandah of his
house, musing how he would feed his children the next day. Just then a man came with
a letter addressed to 'Mahendra Babu', and on opening it, M. found that it was a letter
9from his friend Sri Surendra Nath Banerjee, asking whether he would like to take up a
professorship in the Ripon College. In this way three or four times he gave up the job
that gave him the wherewithal to support the family, either for upholding principles or
for practising spiritual Sadhanas in holy places, without any consideration of the possible
dire worldly consequences; but he was always able to get over these difficulties
somehow, and the interests of his family never suffered. In spite of his disregard for
worldly goods, he was, towards the latter part of his life, in a fairly flourishing condition
as the proprietor of the Morton School which he developed into a noted educational
institution in the city. The Lord has said in the Bhagavad Gitā that in the case of those
who think of nothing except Him, He Himself would take up all their material and
spiritual responsibilities. M. was an example of the truth of the Lord's promise.
Though his children received proper attention from him, his real family, both during the
Master's life-time and after, consisted of saints, devotees, Sannyāsins and spiritual
aspirants. His life exemplifies the Master's teaching that an ideal householder must be
like a good maid-servant of a family, loving and caring properly for the children of the
house, but knowing always that her real home and children are elsewhere. During the
Master's life-time he spent all his Sundays and other holidays with him and his devotees,
and besides listening to the holy talks and devotional music, practised meditation both
on the Personal and the Impersonal aspects of God under the direct guidance of the
Master. In the pages of the Gospel the reader gets a picture of M.'s spiritual relationship
with the Master how from a hazy belief in the Impersonal God of the Brahmos, he was
step by step brought to accept both Personality and Impersonality as the two aspects of
the same Non-dual Being, how he was convinced of the manifestation of that Being as
Gods, Goddesses and as Incarnations, and how he was established in a life that was both
of a Jnāni and of a Bhakta. This Jnāni-Bhakta outlook and way of living became so
dominant a feature of his life that Swami Raghavananda, who was very closely
associated with him during his last six years, remarks: "Among those who lived with M.
in latter days, some felt that he always lived in this constant and conscious union with
God even with open eyes (i.e., even in waking consciousness)." (Swami Raghavananda's
article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXXVII. P. 442.)
Besides undergoing spiritual disciplines at the feet of the Master, M. used to go to holy
places during the Master's life-time itself and afterwards too as a part of his
Sādhanā.
He was one of the earliest of the disciples to visit Kamarpukur, the birthplace of the
Master, in the latter's life-time itself; for he wished to practise contemplation on the
Master's early life in its true original setting. His experience there is described as follows
by Swami Nityatmananda: "By the grace of the Master, he saw the entire Kamarpukur as
a holy place bathed in an effulgent Light. Trees and creepers, beasts and birds and men
all were made of effulgence. So he prostrated to all on the road. He saw a torn cat,
which appeared to him luminous with the Light of Consciousness. Immediately he fell to
the ground and saluted it" (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda
vol. I. P. 40.) He had similar experience in Dakshineswar also. At the instance of the
Master he also visited Puri, and in the words of Swami Nityatmananda, "with indomitable
courage, M. embraced the image of Jagannath out of season."
10The life of Sādhanā and holy association that he started on at the feet of the Master, he
continued all through his life. He has for this reason been most appropriately described
as a Grihastha-Sannyāsi (householder-Sannyāsin). Though he was forbidden by the
Master to become a Sannyāsin, his reverence for the Sannyāsa ideal was whole-hearted
and was without any reservation. So after Sri Ramakrishna's passing away, while several
of the Master's householder devotees considered the young Sannyāsin disciples of the
Master as inexperienced and inconsequential, M. stood by them with the firm faith that
the Master's life and message were going to be perpetuated only through them. Swami
Vivekananda wrote from America in a letter to the inmates of the Math: "When Sri
Thākur (Master) left the body, every one gave us up as a few unripe urchins. But M. and
a few others did not leave us in the lurch. We cannot repay our debt to them." (Swami
Raghavananda's article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXX P. 442.)
M. spent his weekends and holidays with the monastic brethren who, after the Master's
demise, had formed themselves into an Order with a Math at Baranagore, and
participated in the intense life of devotion and meditation that they followed. At other
times he would retire to Dakshineswar or some garden in the city and spend several
days in spiritual practice taking simple self-cooked food. In order to feel that he was one
with all mankind he often used to go out of his home at dead of night, and like a
wandering Sannyāsin, sleep with the waifs on some open verandah or footpath on the
road.
After the Master's demise, M. went on pilgrimage several times. He visited Banāras,
Vrindāvan, Ayodhyā and other places. At Banāras he visited the famous Trailinga Swāmi
and fed him with sweets, and he had long conversations with Swami Bhaskarananda,
one of the noted saintly and scholarly Sannyāsins of the time. In 1912 he went with the
Holy Mother to Banāras, and spent about a year in the company of Sannyāsins at
Banāras, Vrindāvan, Hardwar, Hrishikesh and Swargashram. But he returned to Calcutta,
as that city offered him the unique opportunity of associating himself with the places
hallowed by the Master in his life-time. Afterwards he does not seem to have gone to
any far-off place, but stayed on in his room in the Morton School carrying on his spiritual
ministry, speaking on the Master and his teachings to the large number of people who
flocked to him after having read his famous Kathāmrita known to English readers as The
Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.
This brings us to the circumstances that led to the writing and publication of this
monumental work, which has made M. one of the immortals in hagiographic literature.
While many educated people heard Sri Ramakrishna's talks, it was given to this
illustrious personage alone to leave a graphic and exact account of them for posterity,
with details like date, hour, place, names and particulars about participants. Humanity
owes this great book to the ingrained habit of diary-keeping with which M. was endowed.
Even as a boy of about thirteen, while he was a student in the 3rd class of the Hare
School, he was in the habit of keeping a diary. "Today on rising," he wrote in his diary, "I
11greeted my father and mother, prostrating on the ground before them" (Swami
Nityatmananda's 'M The Apostle and the Evangelist' Part I. P 29.) At another place he
wrote, "Today, while on my way to school, I visited, as usual, the temples of Kāli, the
Mother at Tharitharia, and of Mother Sitala, and paid my obeisance to them." About
twenty-five years after, when he met the Great Master in the spring of 1882, it was the
same instinct of a born diary-writer that made him begin his book, 'unique in the
literature of hagiography', with the memorable words: "When hearing the name of Hari
or Rāma once, you shed tears and your hair stands on end, then you may know for
certain that you do not have to perform devotions such as Sandhya any more."
In addition to this instinct for diary-keeping, M. had great endowments contributing to
success in this line. Writes Swami Nityatmananda who lived in close association with M.,
in his book entitled
M - The Apostle and Evangelist:
"M.'s prodigious memory
combined with his extraordinary power of imagination completely annihilated the
distance of time and place for him. Even after the lapse of half a century he could always
visualise vividly, scenes from the life of Sri Ramakrishna. Superb too was his power to
portray pictures by words."
Besides the prompting of his inherent instinct, the main inducement for M. to keep this
diary of his experiences at Dakshineswar was his desire to provide himself with a means
for living in holy company at all times. Being a school teacher, he could be with the
Master only on Sundays and other holidays, and it was on his diary that he depended for
'holy company' on other days. The devotional scriptures like the Bhagavata say that holy
company is the first and most important means for the generation and growth of
devotion. For, in such company man could hear talks on spiritual matters and listen to
the glorification of Divine attributes, charged with the fervour and conviction emanating
from the hearts of great lovers of God. Such company is therefore the one certain means
through which Sraddha (Faith), Rati (attachment to God) and Bhakti (loving devotion)
are generated. The diary of his visits to Dakshineswar provided M. with material for re-
living, through reading and contemplation, the holy company he had had earlier, even on
days when he was not able to visit Dakshineswar. The wealth of details and the vivid
description of men and things in the midst of which the sublime conversations are set,
provide excellent material to re-live those experiences for any one with imaginative
powers. It was observed by M.'s disciples and admirers that in later life also whenever
he was free or alone, he would be pouring over his diary, transporting himself on the
wings of imagination to the glorious days he spent at the feet of the Master.
During the Master's life-time M. does not seem to have revealed the contents of his diary
to any one. There is an unconfirmed tradition that when the Master saw him taking
notes, he expressed apprehension at the possibility of his utilising these to publicise him
like Keshab Sen; for the Great Master was so full of the spirit of renunciation and
humility that he disliked being lionised. It must be for this reason that no one knew
about this precious diary of M. for a decade until he brought out selections from it as a
pamphlet in English in 1897 with the Holy Mother's blessings and permission. The Holy
Mother, being very much pleased to hear parts of the diary read to her in Bengali, wrote
12Kathāmrita, (Bengali name of the book) I felt as if it was he,
the Master, who was saying all that." (Ibid Part I. P 37.)
to M.: "When I heard the
The two pamphlets in English entitled the 

Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna
appeared in
October and November 1897. They drew the spontaneous acclamation of Swami
Vivekananda, who wrote on 24th November of that year from Dehra Dun to M.:"Many
many thanks for your second leaflet. It is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original,
and never was the life of a Great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the
writer's mind, as you are doing. The language also is beyond all praise, so fresh, so
pointed, and withal so plain and easy. I cannot express in adequate terms how I have
enjoyed them. I am really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't it? Our
Teacher and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have to be original or nothing.
I now understand why none of us attempted His life before. It has been reserved for
you, this great work. He is with you evidently." (Vedānta Kesari Vol. XIX P. 141. Also
given in the first edition of the Gospel published from Ramakrishna Math, Madras in 1911.)
And Swamiji added a post script to the letter: "Socratic dialogues are Plato all over you
are entirely hidden. Moreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it
here or in the West." Indeed, in order to be unknown, Mahendranath had used the pen-
name M., under which the book has been appearing till now. But so great a book cannot
remain obscure for long, nor can its author remain unrecognised by the large public in
these modern times. M. and his book came to be widely known very soon and to meet
the growing demand, a full-sized book, Vol. I of the Gospel, translated by the author
himself, was published in 1907 by the Brahmavadin Office, Madras. A second edition of
it, revised by the author, was brought out by the Ramakrishna Math, Madras in
December 1911, and subsequently a second part, containing new chapters from the
original Bengali, was published by the same Math in 1922. The full English translation of
the Gospel by Swami Nikhilananda appeared first in 1942.
In Bengali the book is published in five volumes, the first part having appeared in 1902
and the others in 1905, 1907, 1910 and 1932 respectively.
It looks as if M. was brought to the world by the Great Master to record his words and
transmit them to posterity. Swami Sivananda, a direct disciple of the Master and the
second President of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, says on this topic: "Whenever
there was an interesting talk, the Master would call Master Mahashay if he was not in the
room, and then draw his attention to the holy words spoken. We did not know then why
the Master did so. Now we can realise that this action of the Master had an important
significance, for it was reserved for Master Mahashay to give to the world at large the
sayings of the Master." (Vedānta Kesari Vol. XIX P 141.) Thanks to M., we get, unlike in
the case of the great teachers of the past, a faithful record with date, time, exact report
of conversations, description of concerned men and places, references to contemporary
13events and personalities and a hundred other details for the last four years of the
Master's life (1882-'86), so that no one can doubt the historicity of the Master and his
teachings at any time in the future.
M. was, in every respect, a true missionary of Sri Ramakrishna right from his first
acquaintance with him in 1882. As a school teacher, it was a practice with him to direct
to the Master such of his students as had a true spiritual disposition. Though himself
prohibited by the Master to take to monastic life, he encouraged all spiritually inclined
young men he came across in his later life to join the monastic Order. Swami
Vijnanananda, a direct Sannyāsin disciple of the Master and a President of the
Ramakrishna Order, once remarked to M.: "By enquiry, I have come to the conclusion
that eighty percent and more of the Sannyāsins have embraced the monastic life after
reading the Kathāmrita (Bengali name of the book) and coming in contact with you." (M
The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda Part I, P 37.)
In 1905 he retired from the active life of a Professor and devoted his remaining twenty-
seven years exclusively to the preaching of the life and message of the Great Master. He
bought the Morton Institution from its original proprietors and shifted it to a commodious
four-storeyed house at 50 Amherst Street, where it flourished under his management as
one of the most efficient educational institutions in Calcutta. He generally occupied a
staircase room at the top of it, cooking his own meal which consisted only of milk and
rice without variation, and attended to all his personal needs himself. His dress also was
the simplest possible. It was his conviction that limitation of personal wants to the
minimum is an important aid to holy living. About one hour in the morning he would
spend in inspecting the classes of the school, and then retire to his staircase room to
pour over his diary and live in the divine atmosphere of the earthly days of the Great
Master, unless devotees and admirers had already gathered in his room seeking his holy
company.
In appearance, M. looked a Vedic Rishi. Tall and stately in bearing, he had a strong and
well-built body, an unusually broad chest, high forehead and arms extending to the
knees. His complexion was fair and his prominent eyes were always tinged with the
expression of the divine love that filled his heart. Adorned with a silvery beard that
flowed luxuriantly down his chest, and a shining face radiating the serenity and gravity
of holiness, M. was as imposing and majestic as he was handsome and engaging in
appearance. Humorous, sweet-tongued and eloquent when situations required, this great
Maharishi of our age lived only to sing the glory of Sri Ramakrishna day and night.
Though a very well versed scholar in the Upanishads, Gitā and the philosophies of the
East and the West, all his discussions and teachings found their culmination in the life
and the message of Sri Ramakrishna, in which he found the real explanation and
illustration of all the scriptures. Both consciously and unconsciously, he was the teacher
of the Kathāmrita the nectarine words of the Great Master.
14Though a much-sought-after spiritual guide, an educationist of repute, and a
contemporary and close associate of illustrious personages like Sri Ramakrishna, Swami
Vivekananda, Keshab Chander Sen and Iswar Chander Vidyāsāgar, he was always
moved by the noble humanity of a lover of God, which consists in respecting the
personalities of all as receptacles of the Divine Spirit. So he taught without the
consciousness of a teacher, and no bar of superiority stood in the way of his doing the
humblest service to his students and devotees. "He was a commission of love," writes
his close devotee, Swami Raghavananda, "and yet his soft and sweet words would pierce
the stoniest heart, make the worldly-minded weep and repent and turn Godwards."
(Prabuddha Bharata Vol. XXXVII P 499.)
As time went on and the number of devotees increased, the staircase room and terrace
of the 3rd floor of the Morton Institution became a veritable Naimisaranya of modern
times, resounding during all hours of the day, and sometimes of night, too, with the
word of God coming from the Rishi-like face of M. addressed to the eager God-seekers
sitting around. To the devotees who helped him in preparing the text of the Gospel, he
would dictate the conversations of the Master in a meditative mood, referring now and
then to his diary. At times in the stillness of midnight he would awaken a nearby devotee
and tell him: "Let us listen to the words of the Master in the depths of the night as he
explains the truth of the Pranava." (Vedānta Kesari XIX P. 142.) Swami Raghavananda,
an intimate devotee of M., writes as follows about these devotional sittings: "In the
sweet and warm months of April and May, sitting under the canopy of heaven on the
roof-garden of 50 Amherst Street, surrounded by shrubs and plants, himself sitting in
their midst like a Rishi of old, the stars and planets in their courses beckoning us to
things infinite and sublime, he would speak to us of the mysteries of God and His love
and of the yearning that would rise in the human heart to solve the Eternal Riddle, as
exemplified in the life of his Master. The mind, melting under the influence of his soft
sweet words of light, would almost transcend the frontiers of limited existence and dare
to peep into the infinite. He himself would take the influence of the setting and say,'What
a blessed privilege it is to sit in such a setting (pointing to the starry heavens), in the
company of the devotees discoursing on God and His love!' These unforgettable scenes
will long remain imprinted on the minds of his hearers." (Prabuddha Bharata Vol XXXVII
P 497.)
About twenty-seven years of his life he spent in this way in the heart of the great city of
Calcutta, radiating the Master's thoughts and ideals to countless devotees who flocked to
him, and to still larger numbers who read his Kathāmrita (English Edition : The Gospel
of Sri Ramakrishna),
the last part of which he had completed before June 1932 and
given to the press. And miraculously, as it were, his end also came immediately after he
had completed his life's mission. About three months earlier he had come to stay at his
home at 13/2 Gurdasprasad Chaudhuary Lane at Thakur Bari, where the Holy Mother
had herself installed the Master and where His regular worship was being conducted for
the previous 40 years. The night of 3rd June being the Phalahārini Kāli Pooja day, M.
15had sent his devotees who used to keep company with him, to attend the special
worship at Belur Math at night. After attending the service at the home shrine, he went
through the proof of the Kathāmrita for an hour. Suddenly he got a severe attack of
neuralgic pain, from which he had been suffering now and then, of late. Before 6 a.m. in
the early hours of 4th June 1932 he passed away, fully conscious and chanting:
'Gurudeva-Ma, Kole tule na-o (Take me in your arms! O Master! O Mother!!)'
