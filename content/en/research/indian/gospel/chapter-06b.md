"Like the physicians, there are 3 types of religious teachers. 

The inferior teacher only gives instruction to the disciples but makes no inquiries about their progress. The mediocre teacher, for the good of the student, makes repeated efforts to bring the instruction home to him, begs him to assimilate it, and shows him love in many other ways. 

But there is a type of teacher who goes to the length of using force when he finds the student persistently unyielding; I call him the best teacher."


## No finality about God's nature

A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, has God forms or has He none?"

MASTER: "No one can say with finality that God is only 'this' and nothing else. He is formless, and again He has forms. For the bhakta He assumes forms. But He is
formless for the jnani, that is, for him who looks on the world as a mere dream. The bhakta feels that he is one entity and the world another. Therefore God reveals Himself to him as a Person. 

But the jnani-the Vedantist, for instance-always reasons, applying the process of 'Not this, not this'. Through this discrimination he realizes, by his inner
perception, that the ego and the universe are both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani
realizes Brahman in his own consciousness. He cannot describe what Brahman is.

"Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, as a shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence, as it were, of the bhakta's love, the
water has frozen at places into blocks of ice. In other words, God now and then assumes various forms for His lovers and reveals Himself to them as a Person. But with
the rising of the sun of Knowledge, the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn't feel any
more that God is a Person, nor does one see God's forms. What He is cannot be described. Who will describe Him? He who would do so disappears. He cannot find his
'I' any more.

## Illusoriness of "I"

"If one analyses oneself, one doesn't find any such thing as 'I'. Take an onion, for instance. First of all you peel off the red outer skin; then you find thick white skins. 

Peel these off one after the other, and you won't find anything inside.

"In that state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. Who is there left to seek it? Who can describe how he feels in that state-in his own Pure Consciousness-
about the real nature of Brahman? 

Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner was it in the water than it melted. Now who was to tell the depth?


## Sign of Perfect Knowledge

"There is a sign of Perfect Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is attained. Then the 'I', which may be likened to the salt doll, melts in the Ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and becomes one with It. Not the slightest trace of distinction is left.
"As long as his self-analysis is not complete, man argues with much ado.

But he becomes silent when he completes it. When the empty pitcher has been filled with water, when the water inside the pitcher becomes one with the water of the lake outside, no more sound is heard. Sound comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not
filled with water.

"People used to say in olden days that no boat returns after having once entered the 'black waters' of the ocean.
"All trouble and botheration come to an end when the 'I' dies. You may indulge in thousands of reasoning, but still the 'I' doesn't disappear. For people like you and me, it is good to have the feeling, 'I am a lover of God.'


## Personal God for devotees

"The Saguna Brahman is meant for the bhaktas. In other words, a bhakta believes that God has attributes and reveals Himself to men as a Person, assuming forms. It is He
who listens to our prayers. The prayers that you utter are directed to Him alone. 

You are bhaktas, not jnanis or Vedantists. It doesn't matter whether you accept God with form or not. 

It is enough to feel that God is a Person who listens to our prayers, who creates, preserves, and destroys the universe, and who is endowed with infinite power.
"It is easier to attain God by following the path of devotion."

BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, is it possible for one to see God? If so, why can't we see Him?"

MASTER: "Yes, He can surely be seen. One can see His forms, and His formless aspect
as well. How can I explain that to you?"

## Intense longing enables one to see God

BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "What are the means by which one can see God?"

MASTER: "Can you weep for Him with intense longing of heart? Men shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their children, for their wives, or for money. But who weeps for
God? 

So long as the child remains engrossed with its toys, the mother looks after her cooking and other household duties. But when the child no longer relishes the toys, it throws them aside and yells for its mother. Then the mother takes the rice-pot down from the hearth, runs in haste, and takes the child in her arms."
164Why so much controversy about God?

BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, why are there so many different opinions about the nature of God? Some say that God has form, while others say that He is formless. Again, those
who speak of God with form tell us about His different forms. Why all this controversy?"

MASTER: "A devotee thinks of God as he sees Him. In reality there is no confusion about God. God explains all this to the devotee if the devotee only realizes Him
somehow. You haven't set your foot in that direction. How can you expect to know all about God?


## Parable of the chameleon

Once a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came back and told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour on
a certain tree. The second man replied: 'When I went into the wood, I also saw that
animal. But why do you call it red? It is green.' 

Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was yellow. Presently others arrived and
contended that it was grey, violet, blue, and so forth and so on. At last they started
quarrelling among themselves. To settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw
a man sitting under it. On being asked, he replied: 'Yes, I live under this tree and I
know the animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red,
sometimes yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey, and so forth. It is a
chameleon. And sometimes it has no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has
none.'
"In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature; he alone
knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and aspects. God has
attributes; then again He has none. Only the man who lives under the tree knows that
the chameleon can appear in various colours, and he knows, further, that the animal at
times has no colour at all. It is the others who suffer from the agony of futile argument.
"Kabir used to say, 'The formless Absolute is my Father, and God with form is my
Mother.'
"God reveals Himself in the form which His devotee loves most. His love for the devotee
knows no bounds. It is written in the Purana that God assumed the form of Rama for
His heroic devotee, Hanuman.
Vedantic Non-dualism
"The forms and aspects of God disappear when one discriminates in accordance with the
Vedanta philosophy. The ultimate conclusion of such discrimination is that Brahman
alone is real and this world of names and forms illusory. It is possible for a man to see
the forms of God, or to think of Him as a Person, only so long as he is conscious that he
is a devotee. From the standpoint of discrimination this 'ego of a devotee' keeps him a
little away from God.
"Do you know why images of Krishna or Kāli are three and a half cubits high? Because of
distance. Again, on account of distance the sun appears to be small. But if you go near
165it you will find the sun so big that you won't be able to comprehend it. Why have images
of Krishna and Kāli a dark-blue colour? That too is on account of distance, like the water
of a lake, which appears green, blue, or black from a distance. Go near, take the water
in the palm of your hand, and you will find that it has no colour. The sky also appears
blue from a distance. Go near and you will see that it has no colour at all.
"Therefore I say that in the light of Vedantic reasoning Brahman has no attributes. The
real nature of Brahman cannot be described. But so long as your individuality is real,
the world also is real, and equally real are the different forms of God and the feeling that
God is a Person.
"Yours is the path of bhakti. That is very good; it is an easy path. Who can fully know
the infinite God? and what need is there of knowing the Infinite? Having attained this
rare human birth, my supreme need is to develop love for the Lotus Feet of God.
"If a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst, why should I measure the quantity of
water in a lake? I become drunk on even half a bottle of wine-what is the use of my
calculating the quantity of liquor in the tavern? What need is there of knowing the
Infinite?
"The various states of mind of the Brahmajnani are described in the Vedas. The path of
knowledge is extremely difficult. One cannot obtain jnāna if one has the least trace of
worldliness and the slightest attachment to 'woman and gold'. This is not the path for
the Kaliyuga.
Seven planes of the mind
"The Vedas speak of seven planes where the mind dwells. When the mind is immersed
in worldliness it dwells in the three lower planes- at the naval, the organ of generation,
and the organ of evacuation. In that state the mind loses all its higher visions-it broods
only on 'woman and gold'. The fourth plane of the mind is at the heart. When the mind
dwells there, one has the first glimpse of spiritual consciousness. One sees light all
around. Such a man, perceiving the divine light, becomes speechless with wonder and
says: 'Ah! What is this? What is this?' His mind does not go downward to the objects of
the world.
"The fifth plane of the mind is at the throat. When the mind reaches this, the aspirant
becomes free from all ignorance and illusion. He does not enjoy talking or hearing about
anything but God. If people talk about worldly things, he leaves the place at once.
"The sixth plane is at the forehead. When the mind reaches it, the aspirant sees the
form of God day and night. But even then a little trace of ego remains. At the sight of
that incomparable beauty of God's form, one becomes intoxicated and rushes forth to
touch and embrace it. But one doesn't succeed. It is like the light inside a lantern. One
feels as if one could touch the light, but one cannot on account of the pane of glass.
"In the top of the head is the seventh plane. When the mind rises there, one goes into
samādhi. Then the Brahmajnani directly perceives Brahman. But in that state his body
166does not last many days. He remains unconscious of the outer world. If milk is poured
into his mouth, it runs out. Dwelling on this plane of consciousness, he gives up his
body in twenty-one days. That is the condition of the Brahmajnani. But yours is the
path of devotion. That is a very good and easy path.
"Once a man said to me, 'Sir, can you teach me quickly the thing you call samādhi?' (All
laugh.)
Duties drop away with deepening of spiritual mood
"After a man has attained samādhi all his actions drop away. All devotional activities,
such as worship, japa, and the like, as well as all worldly duties, cease to exist for such a
person. At the beginning there is much ado about work. As a man makes progress
toward God, the outer display of his work becomes less and less-so much so that he
cannot even sing the name and glories of God. (To Shivanath) As long as you were not
here at the meeting, people talked a great deal about you and discussed your virtues.
But no sooner did you arrive here than all that stopped. Now the very sight of you
makes everyone happy. People now simply say, 'Ah! Here is Shivanath Babu.' All other
talk about you has stopped.
What happens after samādhi
"After attaining samādhi, I once went to the Ganges to perform tarpan. But as I took
water in the palm of my hand, it trickled down through my fingers. Weeping, I said to
Haladhāri, 'Cousin, what is this?' Haladhāri replied, 'It is called galitahasta in the holy
books.' After the vision of God, such duties as the performance of tarpan drop away.
"In the kirtan the devotee first sings, 'Nitai amar mata hati.' As the devotional mood
deepens, he simply sings, 'Hati! Hati!' Next, all he can sing is 'Hati'. And last of all he
simply sings, 'Ha!' and goes into samādhi. The man who has been singing all the while
then becomes speechless.
"Again, at a feast given to the brahmins one at first hears much noise of talking. When
the guests sit on the floor with leaf-plates in front of them, much of the noise ceases.
Then
one
hears
only
the
cry,
'Bring
some
luchi!'
As they partake of the luchi and other dishes, three quarters of the noise subsides.
When the curd, the last course, appears, one hears only the sound 'soop, soop' as the
guests eat the curd with their fingers. Then there is practically no noise. Afterwards all
retire to sleep, and absolute silence reigns.
"Therefore I say, at the beginning of religious life a man makes much ado about work,
but as his mind dives deeper into God, he becomes less active. Last of all comes the
renunciation of work, followed by samādhi.
"Generally the body does not remain alive after the attainment of samādhi. The only
exceptions are such sages as Narada, who keep their bodies alive in order to bring
spiritual light to others. It is also true of Divine Incarnations, like Chaitanya. After the
well is dug, one generally throws away the spade and the basket. But some keep them
167in order to help their neighbours. The great souls who retain their bodies after samādhi
feel compassion for the suffering of others. They are not so selfish as to be satisfied
with their own illumination. You are well aware of the nature of selfish people. If you
ask them to spit at a particular place, they won't, lest it should do you good. If you ask
them to bring a sweetmeat worth a cent from the store, they will perhaps lick it on the
way back. (All laugh.)
"But the manifestations of Divine Power are different in different beings. Ordinary souls
are afraid to teach others. A piece of worthless timber may itself somehow float across
the water, but it sinks even under the weight of a bird. Sages like Narada are like a
heavy log of wood, which not only floats on the water but also can carry men, cows, and
even elephants.
(To Shivanath and the other Brahmo devotees) "Can you tell me why you dwell so much
on the powers and glories of God? I asked the same thing of Keshab Sen. One day
Keshab and his party came to the temple garden at Dakshineswar. I told them I wanted
to hear how they lectured. A meeting was arranged in the paved courtyard above the
bathing-ghat on the Ganges, where Keshab gave a talk. He spoke very well. I went into
a trance. After the lecture I said to Keshab, 'Why do you so often say such things as: "O
God, what beautiful flowers Thou hast made! O God, Thou hast created the heavens, the
stars, and the ocean!" and so on?' Those who love splendour themselves are fond of
dwelling on God's splendour.
"Once a thief stole the jewels from the images in the temple of Radhakanta. Mathur
Babu entered the temple and said to the Deity: 'What a shame, O God! You couldn't
save Your own ornaments.' 'The idea!' I said to Mathur. 'Does He who has Lakshmi for
His handmaid and attendant ever lack any splendour? Those jewels may be precious to
you, but to God they are no better than lumps of clay. Shame on you! You shouldn't
have spoken so meanly. 'What riches can you give to God to magnify His glory?'
"Therefore I say, a man seeks the person in whom he finds joy. What need has he to
ask where that person lives, the number of his houses, gardens, relatives, and servants,
or the amount of his wealth? I forget everything when I see Narendra. Never, even
unwittingly, have I asked him where he lived, what his father's profession was, or the
number of his brothers.
"Dive deep in the sweetness of God's Bliss. What need have we of His infinite creation
and unlimited glory?"
The Master sang:
Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty;
If you descend to the uttermost depths,
There you will find the gem of Love.
Go seek, O mind, go seek Vrindāvan in your heart,
Where with His loving devotees
Sri Krishna sports eternally.
168Light up, O mind, light up true wisdom's shining lamp,
And let it burn with steady flame
Unceasingly within your heart.
Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth?
It is your guru, says Kubir;
Meditate on his holy feet.
Sri Ramakrishna continued: "It is also true that after the vision of God the devotee
desires to witness His lila. After the destruction of Ravana at Rama's hands, Nikasha,
Ravana's mother, began to run away for fear of her life. Lakshmana said to Rama:
'Revered Brother, please explain this strange thing to me. This Nikasha is an old woman
who has suffered a great deal from the loss of her many sons, and yet she is so afraid of
losing her own life that she is taking to her heels!' Rama bade her come near, gave her
assurance of safety, and asked her why she was running away. Nikasha answered: 'O
Rama, I am able to witness all this lila of Yours because I am still alive. I want to live
longer so that I may see the many more things You will do on this earth.' (All laugh.)
(To Shivanath) "I like to see you. How can I live unless I see pure-souled devotees? I
feel as if they had been my friends in a former incarnation."
Reincarnation of soul & Inscrutability of God's ways
A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, do you believe in the reincarnation of the soul?"
MASTER: "Yes, they say there is something like that. How can we understand the ways
of God through our small intellects? Many people have spoken about reincarnation;
therefore I cannot disbelieve it. As Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava
brothers and Krishna stood around him. They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the
great hero. Arjuna said to Krishna: 'Friend, how surprising it is! Even such a man as our
grandsire Bhishma-truthful, self-restrained, supremely wise, and one of the eight Vasus-
weeps, through maya, at the hour of death.' Sri Krishna asked Bhishma about it.
Bhishma replied: 'O Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause of my grief. I
am thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas' sufferings, though God Himself is their
charioteer.7 A thought like this makes me feel that I have understood nothing of the
ways of God, and so I weep.' "
It was about half past eight when the evening worship began in the prayer hall. Soon
the moon rose in the autumn sky and flooded the trees and creepers of the garden with
its light. After prayer the devotees began to sing. Sri Ramakrishna was dancing,
intoxicated with love of God. The Brahmo devotees danced around him to the
accompaniment of drums and cymbals. All appeared to be in a very joyous mood. The
place echoed and re-echoed with God's holy name. When the music had stopped, Sri
Ramakrishna prostrated himself on the ground and, making salutations to the Divine
Mother again and again, said: "Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan! My salutations at the feet
of the jnanis! My salutations at the feet of the bhaktas! I salute the bhaktas who believe
in God with form, and I salute the bhaktas who believe in God without form. I salute the
169knowers of Brahman of olden times. And my salutations at the feet of the modern
knowers of Brahman of the Brahmo Samaj!"
Then the Master and the devotees enjoyed a supper of delicious dishes, which
Benimadhav, their host, had provided.

Master at the circus
Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by Rakhal and several other devotees, came to Calcutta
in a carriage and called for M. at the school where he was teaching. Then they all set
out for the Maidan. Sri Ramakrishna wanted to see the Wilson Circus. As the carriage
rolled along the crowded Chitpore Road, his joy was very great. Like a little child he
leaned first out of one side of the carriage and then out of the other, talking to himself
as if addressing the passers-by. To M. he said: "I find the attention of the people fixed
on earthly things. They are all rushing about for the sake of their stomachs. No one is
thinking of God."
They arrived at the circus. Tickets for the cheapest seats were purchased. The devotees
took the Master to a high gallery, and they all sat on a bench. He said joyfully: "Ha! This
is a good place. I can see the show well from here." There were exhibitions of various
feats. A horse raced around a circular track over which large iron rings were hung at
intervals. The circus rider, an Englishwoman, stood on one foot on the horse's back, and
as the horse passed under the rings, she jumped through them, always alighting on one
foot on the horse's back. The horse raced around the entire circle, and the woman never
missed the horse or lost her balance.
When the circus was over, the Master and the devotees stood outside in the field, near
the carriage. Since it was a cold night he covered his body with his green shawl.
Necessity of spiritual discipline
Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "Did you see how that Englishwoman stood on one foot on
her horse, while it ran like lightning? How difficult a feat that must be! She must have
practised a long time. The slightest carelessness and she would break her arms or legs;
she might even be killed. One faces the same difficulty leading the life of a
householder. A few succeed in it through the grace of God and as a result of their
spiritual practice. But most people fail. Entering the world, they become more and
more involved in it; they drown in worldliness and suffer the agonies of death. A few
only, like Janaka, have succeeded, through the power of their austerity, in leading the
spiritual life as householders. Therefore spiritual practice is extremely necessary;
otherwise one cannot rightly live in the world."
The Master got into the carriage with the devotees and went to Balaram Bose's house.
He was taken with his companions to the second floor. It was evening and the lamps
were lighted. The Master described the feats he had seen at the circus. Gradually other
devotees gathered, and soon he was engaged in spiritual talk with them.
170Master on caste-system
The conversation turned to the caste-system. Sri Ramakrishna said: "The caste-system
can be removed by one means only, and that is the love of God. Lovers of God do not
belong to any caste. The mind, body, and soul of a man become purified through divine
love. Chaitanya and Nityananda scattered the name of Hari to everyone, including the
pariah, and embraced them all. A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin.
And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah. Through bhakti an untouchable
becomes pure and elevated."
Entanglement of householders
Speaking of householders entangled in worldliness, the Master said: "They are like the
silk-worm. They can come out of the cocoon of their worldly life if they wish. But they
can't bear to; for they themselves have built the cocoon with great love and care. So
they die there. Or they are like the fish in a trap. They can come out of it by the way
they entered, but they sport inside the trap with other fish and hear the sweet sound of
the murmuring water and forget everything else. They don't even make an effort to free
themselves from the trap. The lisping of children is the murmur of the water; and the
other fish are relatives and friends. Only one or two make good their escape by running
away. They are the liberated souls."
The Master then sang:
When such delusion veils the world, through Mahamaya's spell,
That Brahma is bereft of sense,
And Vishnu loses consciousness,
What hope is left for men?
The narrow channel first is made, and there the trap is set;
But open though the passage lies,
The fish, once safely through the gate,
Do not come out again.
The silk-worm patiently prepares its closely spun cocoon;
Yet even though a way leads forth,
Encased within its own cocoon,
The worm remains to die.
The Master continued: "Man may be likened to grain. He has fallen between the
millstones and is about to be crushed. Only the few grains that stay near the peg
escape. Therefore men should take refuge at the peg, that is to say, in God. Call on
Him. Sing His name. Then you will be free. Otherwise you will be crushed by the King
of Death."
The Master sang again:
Mother! Mother! My boat is sinking, here in the ocean of this
world;
Fiercely the hurricane of delusion rages on every side!
171Clumsy is my helmsman, the mind; stubborn my six oarsmen,
the passions;
Into a pitiless wind
I sailed my boat, and now it is sinking!
Split is the rudder of devotion; tattered is the sail of faith;
Into my boat the waters are pouring! Tell me, what shall I do?
For with my failing eyes, alas! nothing but darkness do I see.
Here in the waves I will swim,
O Mother, and cling to the raft of Thy name!
Mr. Viswas had been sitting in the room a long time; he now left. He had once been
wealthy but had squandered everything in an immoral life. Finally he had become
indifferent to his wife and children. Referring to Mr. Viswas, the Master said: "He is an
unfortunate wretch. A householder has his duties to discharge, his debts to pay: his
debt to the gods, his debt to his ancestors, his debt to the rishis, and his debt to wife
and children. If a wife is chaste, then her husband should support her; he should also
bring up their children until they are of age. Only a monk must not save; the bird and
the monk do not provide for the morrow. But even a bird provides when it has young.
It brings food in its bill for its chicks."
BALARAM: "Mr. Viswas now wants to cultivate the company of holy people."
MASTER (with a smile): "A monk's kamandalu goes to the four principal holy places with
him, but it still tastes bitter. Likewise, it is said that the Malaya breeze turns all trees
into sandal-wood. But there are a few exceptions, such as the cotton-tree, the
Aśwattha, and the hog plum.
"Some frequent the company of holy men in order to smoke hemp. Many monks smoke
it, and these householders stay with them, prepare the hemp, and partake of the
prasad."
Thursday, November 16, 1882
The Master had come to Calcutta. In the evening he went to the house of Rajmohan, a
member of the Brahmo Samaj, where Narendra and some of his young friends used to
meet and worship according to the Brahmo ceremonies. Sri Ramakrishna wanted to see
their worship. He was accompanied by M. and a few other devotees.
The Master was very happy to see Narendra and expressed a desire to watch the young
men at their worship. Narendra sang and then the worship began. One of the young
men conducted it. He prayed, "O Lord, may we give up everything and be absorbed in
Thee!" Possibly the youth was inspired by the Master's presence and so talked of utter
renunciation. Sri Ramakrishna remarked in a whisper, "Much likelihood there is of that!"
Rajmohan served the Master with refreshments.
172Sunday, November 19, 1882
It was the auspicious occasion of the Jagaddhatri Puja, the festival of the Divine Mother.
Sri Ramakrishna was invited to Surendra's house in Calcutta; but first he went to the
house of Manomohan in the neighbourhood.
The Master was seated in Manomohan's parlour.
He said: "God very
much relishes the bhakti of the poor and the lowly, just as the cow relishes fodder mixed
with oil-cake. King Duryodhana showed Krishna the splendour of his wealth and riches,
but Krishna accepted the hospitality of the poor Vidura. God is fond of His devotees. He
runs after the devotee as the cow after the calf."
The Master sang:
And, for that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to
age;
When love awakes, the Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the
soul.
Then he said: "Chaitanya used to shed tears of joy at the very mention of Krishna's
name. God alone is the real Substance; all else is illusory. Man can realize God if he
wants to, but he madly craves the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'. The snake has a
precious stone in its head, but it is perfectly satisfied to eat a mere frog.
"Bhakti is the one essential thing. Who can ever know God through reasoning? I want
love of God. What do I care about knowing His infinite glories? One bottle of wine makes
me drunk. What do I care about knowing how many gallons there are in the grog-shop?
One jar of water is enough to quench my thirst. I don't need to know the amount of
water there is on earth."
Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Surendra's house. Many devotees had assembled there,
including Surendra's elder brother, who was a judge.
Futility of reasoning
MASTER (To Surendra's brother): "You are a judge. That is very good. But remember,
everything happens through God's power. It is He who has given you your high
position; that is how you became a judge. People think it is they who are great. The
water from the roof flows through a spout that is shaped like a lion's head. It looks as if
the lion were bringing the water out through its mouth. But look at the source of the
water! A cloud gathers in the sky and rain falls on the roof; then the water flows through
the pipe and at last comes out through the spout."
SURENDRA'S BROTHER: "The Brahmo Samaj preaches the freedom of women and the
abolition of the caste-system. What do you think about these matters?"
MASTER: "Men feel that way when they are just beginning to develop spiritual yearning.
A storm raises clouds of dust, and one cannot distinguish between the different trees-the
mango, the hog plum, and the tamarind. But after the storm blows over, one sees
clearly. After the first storm of divine passion is quelled, one gradually understands that
173God alone is the Highest Good, the Eternal Substance, and that all else is transitory.
One cannot grasp this without tapasya and the company of holy men. What is the use of
merely reciting the written parts for the drum? It is very difficult to put them into
practice on the instrument. What can be accomplished by a mere lecture? It is austerity
that is necessary. By that alone can one comprehend.
"You asked about caste distinctions. There is only one way to remove them, and that is
by love of God. Lovers of God have no caste. Through this divine love the untouchable
becomes pure, the pariah no longer remains a pariah. Chaitanya embraced all, including
the pariahs.
"The members of the Brahmo Samaj sing the name of Hari. That is very good. Through
earnest prayer one receives the grace of God and realizes Him. God can be realized by
means of all paths. The same God is invoked by different names."
Master on Theosophy
SURENDRA'S BROTHER: "Sir, what do you think of Theosophy?"
MASTER: "I have heard that man can acquire superhuman powers through it and
perform miracles. I saw a man who had brought a ghost under control. The ghost used
to procure various things for his master. What shall I do with superhuman powers? Can
one realize God through them? If God is not realized then everything becomes false."
November 1882
It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when Sri Ramakrishna arrived in Calcutta to
attend the annual festival of the Brahmo Samaj, which was to be celebrated at Manilal
Mallick's house. Besides M. and other devotees of the Master, Vijay Goswami and a
number of Brahmos were present. Elaborate arrangements had been made to make the
occasion a success. Vijay was to conduct the worship.
The kathak recited the life of Prahlada from the Purana. Its substance was as follows:
Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada's father, was king of the demons. He bore great malice toward
God and put his own son through endless tortures for leading a religious life. Afflicted by
his father, Prahlada prayed to God, "O God, please give my father holy inclinations."
At these words the Master wept. He went into an ecstatic mood. Afterwards he began
to talk to the devotees.
MASTER: "Bhakti is the only essential thing. One obtains love of God by constantly
chanting His name and singing His glories. Ah! What a devotee Shivanath is! He is
soaked in the love of God, like a cheese-cake in syrup.
"One should not think, 'My religion alone is the right path and other religions are false.'
God can be realized by means of all paths. It is enough to have sincere yearning for
God. Infinite are the paths and infinite the opinions.
174The pure in heart see God
"Let me tell you one thing. God can be seen. The Vedas say that God is beyond mind
and speech. The meaning of this is that God is unknown to the mind attached to worldly
objects. Vaishnavcharan used to say, 'God is known by the mind and intellect that are
pure.' Therefore it is necessary to seek the company of holy men, practise prayer, and
listen to the instruction of the guru. These purify the mind. Then one sees God. Dirt
can be removed from water by a purifying agent. Then one sees one's reflection in it.
One cannot see one's face in a mirror if the mirror is covered with dirt.
"After the purification of the heart one obtains divine love. Then one sees God, through
His grace. One can teach others if one receives that command from God after seeing
Him. Before that one should not 'lecture'. There is a song that says:
You have set up no image here,
Within the shrine, O fool!
Blowing the conch, you simply make
Confusion worse confounded.
"You should first cleanse the shrine of your heart. Then you should install the Deity and
arrange worship. As yet nothing has been done. What can you achieve by blowing the
conch-shell and simply making a loud noise?"
Vijay sat on a raised stool and conducted the worship according to the rules of the
Brahmo Samaj. Afterwards he sat by the Master.
MASTER (to Vijay): "Will you tell me one thing? Why did you harp so much on sin? By
repeating a hundred times, 'I am a sinner', one verily becomes a sinner. One should
have such faith as to be able to say, 'What? I have taken the name of God; how can I be
a sinner?' God is our Father and Mother. Tell Him, 'O Lord, I have committed sins, but I
won't repeat them.' Chant His name and purify your body and mind. Purify your tongue
by singing God's holy name."
December 1882
In the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the west porch of his room in the
temple garden at Dakshineswar. Among others, Baburam, Ramdayal, and M. were
present. These three were going to spend the night with the Master. M. intended to
stay the following day also, for he was having his Christmas holidays. Baburam had only
recently begun to visit the Master.
MASTER (to the devotees): "A man becomes liberated even in this life when he knows
that God is the Doer of all things. Once Keshab came here with Sambhu Mallick. I said
to him, 'Not even a leaf moves except by the will of God.' Where is man's free will? All
are under the will of God. Nangta was a man of great knowledge, yet even he was
about to drown himself in the Ganges. He stayed here eleven months. At one time he
suffered from stomach trouble. The excruciating pain made him lose control over
himself, and he wanted to drown himself in the river. There was a long shoal near the
bathing-ghat. However far he went into the river, he couldn't find water above his
175knees. Then he understood everything and came back. At one time I was very ill and
was about to cut my throat with a knife. Therefore I say: 'O Mother, I am the machine
and Thou art the Operator; I am the chariot and Thou art the Driver. I move as Thou
movest me; I do as Thou makest me do.' "
The devotees sing kirtan in the Master's room:
Dwell, O Lord, O Lover of bhakti,
In the Vrindāvan of my heart,
And my devotion unto Thee
Will be Thy Radha, dearly loved;
My body will be Nanda's home,
My tenderness will be Yaśoda,
My longing for deliverance
Will be Thy gentle gopi maids.
Lift the Govardhan of my sin
And slay my six unyielding passions,
Fierce as the demons sent by Kamsa!
Sweetly play the flute of Thy grace,
Charming the milch cow of my mind;
Abide in the pasture of my soul.
Dwell by the Jamuna of my yearning,
Under the banyan of my hope,
For ever gracious to Thy servant;
And, if naught but the cowherds' love
Can hold Thee in Vrindāvan's vale,
Then, Lord, let Dasarathi, too,
Become Thy cowherd and Thy slave.
Again they sang:
Sing, O bird that nestles deep within my heart!
Sing, O bird that sits on the Kalpa-Tree of Brahman!
Sing God's everlasting praise.
Taste, O bird, of the four fruits of the Kalpa-Tree,
Dharma, artha, kama, moksha.
Sing, O bird, "He alone is the Comfort of my soul!"
Sing, O bird, "He alone is my life's enduring Joy!"
O thou wondrous bird of my life,
Sing aloud in my heart! Unceasingly sing, O bird!
Sing for evermore, even as the thirsty chatak
Sings for the raindrop from the cloud.

A devotee from Nandanbagan entered the room with his friends. The Master looked at him and said, "Everything inside him can be seen through his eyes, as one sees the
objects in a room through a glass door." This devotee and his brothers always celebrated the anniversary of the Brahmo Samaj at their house in Nandanbagan. Sri Ramakrishna had taken part in these festivals.

The evening worship began in the temples. The Master was seated on the small couch in his room, absorbed in meditation. He went into an ecstatic mood and said a little later: 

"Mother, please draw him to Thee. He is so modest and humble! He has been visiting Thee." Was the Master referring to Baburam, who later became one of his foremost
disciples? 

Why so much suffering in God's creation?

The Master explained the different kinds of samādhi to the devotees. The conversation then turned to the joy and suffering of life. Why did God create so much suffering?
M: "Once Vidyasagar said in a mood of pique: 'What is the use of calling on God? 

Just think of this incident: At one time Chenghiz Khan plundered a country and imprisoned
many people. The number of prisoners rose to about a hundred thousand. The
commander of his army said to him: "Your Majesty, who will feed them? It is risky to
keep them with us. 

It will be equally dangerous to release them. What shall I do?"

Chenghiz Khan said: "That's true. What can be done? Well, have them killed." The order
was accordingly given to cut them to pieces. Now, God saw this slaughter, didn't He?
But He didn't stop it in any way. Therefore I don't need God, whether He exists or not.
I don't derive any good from Him.'"

MASTER: "Is it possible to understand God's action and His motive? He creates, He preserves, and He destroys. Can we ever understand why He destroys? I say to the
Divine Mother: 'O Mother, I do not need to understand. Please give me love for Thy Lotus Feet.' The aim of human life is to attain bhakti. As for other things, the Mother
knows best. I have come to the garden to eat mangoes. 

What is the use of my calculating the number of trees, branches, and leaves? I only eat the mangoes; I don't
need to know the number of trees and leaves."

Baburam, M., and Ramdayal slept that night on the floor of the Master's room.

It was an early hour of the morning, about two or three o'clock. The room was dark. Sri
Ramakrishna was seated on his bed and now and then conversed with the devotees.

## Compassion and attachment

MASTER: "Remember that daya, compassion, and maya, attachment, are two different
things. Attachment means the feeling of 'my-ness' toward one's relatives. It is the love
one feels for one's parents, one's brother, one's sister, one's wife and children.
Compassion is the love one feels for all beings of the world. It is an attitude of equality.
If you see anywhere an instance of compassion, as in Vidyasagar, know that it is due to
the grace of God. Through compassion one serves all beings. Maya also comes from
God. Through maya God makes one serve one's relatives. But one thing should be
remembered: maya keeps us in ignorance and entangles us in the world, whereas daya
makes our hearts pure and gradually unties our bonds.

"God cannot be realized without purity of heart. One receives the grace of God by subduing the passions-lust, anger, and greed. Then one sees God. I tried many things
in order to conquer lust.

"When I was 11 years old and lived at Kamarpukur, I first experienced samādhi. As I was passing through a paddy-field, I saw something and was
overwhelmed. There are certain characteristics of God-vision. 

One sees light, feels joy, and experiences the upsurge of a great current in one's chest, like the bursting of a rocket."

The next day Baburam and Ramdayal returned to Calcutta. M. spent the day and the
night with the Master.

December 1882

It was afternoon. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar with M. and one
or two other devotees. Several Marwari devotees arrived and saluted the Master. They
requested Sri Ramakrishna to give them spiritual instruction. He smiled.
MASTER (to the Marwari devotees): "You see, the feeling of 'I' and 'mine' is the result of
ignorance. But to say, 'O God, Thou art the Doer; all these belong to Thee' is the sign of
Knowledge. How can you say such a thing as 'mine'? The superintendent of the garden
says, 'This is my garden.' But if he is dismissed because of some misconduct, then he
does not have the courage to take away even such a worthless thing as his mango-wood
box. Anger and lust cannot be destroyed. Turn them toward God. If you must feel
desire and temptation, then desire to realize God, feel tempted by Him. Discriminate
and turn the passions away from worldly objects. When the elephant is about to devour
a plaintain-tree in someone's garden, the mahut strikes it with his iron-tipped goad.
"You are merchants. You know how to improve your business gradually. Some of you
start with a castor-oil factory. After making some money at that, you open a cloth
shop. In the same way, one makes progress toward God. It may be that you go into
solitude, now and then, and devote more time to prayer.
"But you must remember that nothing can be achieved except in its proper time. Some
persons must pass through many experiences and perform many worldly duties before
they can turn their attention to God; so they have to wait a long time. If an abscess is
lanced before it is soft, the result is not good; the surgeon makes the opening when it is
soft and has come to a head. Once a child said to its mother: 'Mother, I am going to
sleep now. Please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' 'My child,' said the
mother, 'when it is time for that, you will wake up yourself. I shan't have to wake you.'
"
The Marwari devotees generally brought offerings of fruit, candy, and other sweets for
the Master. But Sri Ramakrishna could hardly eat them. He would say: "They earn their
money by falsehood. I can't eat their offerings." He said to the Marwaris: "You see, one
can't strictly adhere to truth in business. There are ups and downs in business. Nanak
once said, 'I was about to eat the food of unholy people, when I found it stained with
178blood.' A man should offer only pure things to holy men. He shouldn't give them food
earned by dishonest means. God is realized by following the path of truth. One should
always chant His name. Even while one is performing one's duties, the mind should be
left with God. Suppose I have a carbuncle on my back. I perform my duties, but the
mind is drawn to the carbuncle. It is good to repeat the name of Rama. 'The same
Rama who was the son of King Dasaratha has created this world. Again, as Spirit, He
pervades all beings. He is very near us; He is both within and without.' "
