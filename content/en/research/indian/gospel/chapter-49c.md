Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed and talking to M. No one else was in the room. It
was about four o'clock in the afternoon.
MASTER: "If Kshirode makes a pilgrimage to Gangasagar, then please buy a blanket for
him."
M: "Yes, sir."
Sri Ramakrishna was silent a few minutes. Then he continued.
Devotees' detachment from the world
MASTER: "Well can you tell me what is happening to these youngsters? Some are
running off to Puri, and some to Gangasagar. All have renounced their homes. Look at
Narendra! When a man is seized with the spirit of intense renunciation, he regards the
world as a deep well and his relatives as venomous cobras."
M: "Yes, sir. Life in the world is full of suffering."
MASTER: "Yes, it is the suffering of hell-and that from the very moment of birth! Don't
you see what a trouble one's wife and children are?"
M: "Yes, sir. You yourself said: 'These youngsters have no relationship whatsoever with
the world. They owe nothing to the world, nor do they expect anything from it. It is the
sense of obligation that entangles a man in the world.' "MASTER: "Don't you see how Niranjan is? His attitude toward the world is this: 'Here,
take what is Thine, and give me what is mine.' That is all. He has no further relationship
with the world. There is nothing to pull him from behind.
"'Woman and gold' alone is the world. Don't you see that if you have money you want to
lay it by?"
M. burst out laughing. Sri Ramakrishna also laughed.
M: "One thinks a great deal before taking the money out. (Both laugh.) But once you
said at Dakshineswar that it is quite different if one is able to live in the world free from
the three Gunās ."
MASTER: "Yes-like a child!"
M: "Yes, sir. But it is exceedingly difficult; it requires tremendous power."
Sri Ramakrishna remained silent.
M: "Yesterday they went to Dakshineswar to meditate. I had a dream."
MASTER: "What did you dream?"
M: "I dreamt that Narendra and some others had become sannyāsis. They were sitting
around a lighted fire, I too was there. They were smoking tobacco and blowing out puffs
of smoke. I told them that I could smell hemp."
MASTER: "Mental renunciation is the essential thing. That, too, makes one a sannyāsi."
Sri Ramakrishna kept silent a few minutes and then went on.
MASTER: "But one must set fire to one's desires. Then alone can one succeed."
M: "You said to the pundit of the Mārwāris from Burrabazar that you had the desire for
bhakti. Isn't the desire for bhakti to be counted as a desire?".
MASTER: "No, just as Hinche greens are not to be counted as greens. Hinche restrains
the secretion of bile.
"Well, all my joy, all my ecstasy-where are they now?"
M: "Perhaps you are now in the state of mind that the Gitā describes as beyond the
three Gunās . Sattva, rajas, and tamas are performing their own functions, and you
yourself are unattached-unattached even to sattva."
MASTER: "Yes, the Divine Mother has put me into the state of a child. Tell me, won't the
body live through this illness?"The Master and M. became silent. Narendra entered the room. He was going home to
settle his family affairs.
Since his father's death Narendra had been in great distress about his mother and
brothers. Now and then they had been threatened with starvation. Narendra was the
family's only hope: they expected him to earn money and feed them. But Narendra could
not appear for his law examination; he was passing through a state of intense
renunciation. He was going to Calcutta that day to make some provision for the family. A
friend had agreed to lend him one hundred rupees. That would take care of the family
for three months.
NARENDRA: "I am going home. (To M.) I shall visit Mahimacharan on the way. Will you
come with me?"
M. did not want to go. Looking at M., Sri Ramakrishna asked Narendra, "Why?"
NARENDRA: "I am going that way; so I shall stop at Mahima's place and have a chat
with him."
Sri Ramakrishna looked at Narendra intently.
NARENDRA: "A friend who comes here said he would lend me a hundred rupees. That
will take care of the family for three months. I am going home to make that
arrangement."
Sri Ramakrishna remained silent and looked at M.
M. (to Narendra): "No; you go ahead. I shall go later."
Thursday, March 11, 1886
It was eight o'clock in the evening. Sri Ramakrishna was in the big hall on the second
floor. Narendra, Śaśi, M., Sarat, and the elder Gopal were in the room. Sri Ramakrishna
was lying down. Sarat stood by his bed and fanned him. The Master was speaking about
his illness.
MASTER: "If some of you go to Dakshineswar and see Bholanath, he will give you a
medicinal oil and also tell you how to apply it."
THE ELDER GOPAL: "Then we shall go for the oil tomorrow morning."
M: "If someone goes this evening he can bring the oil."
ŚAŚI: "I can go."
MASTER (pointing to Sarat): "He may go."After a time Sarat set out for Dakshineswar to get the oil from Bholanath. The devotees,
sitting around Sri Ramakrishna's bed, were silent. Suddenly the Master sat up. He spoke
to Narendranath.
Brahman is beyond the Gunās
MASTER: "Brahman is without taint. The three
Gunās are
in Brahman, but It is Itself
untainted by them.
"You may find both good and bad smells in the air; but the air itself is unaffected.
"Sankaracharya was going along a street in Benares. An outcaste carrying a load of
meat suddenly touched him. 'What!' said Sankara. 'You have touched me!' 'Revered sir,'
said the outcaste, 'I have not touched you nor have you touched me. The Ātman is
above all contamination, and you are that Pure Ātman.'
Brahman and māyā
"Of Brahman and māyā, the Jnāni rejects māyā.
"Māyā is like a veil. You see, I hold this towel between you and the lamp. You no longer
see the light of the lamp."
Sri Ramakrishna put the towel between himself and the devotees.
MASTER: "Now you cannot see my face any more. As Ramprasad said, 'Raise the
curtain, and behold!'
"The bhakta, however, does not ignore māyā. He worships Mahamaya. Taking refuge in
Her, he says: 'O Mother, please stand aside from my path. Only if You step out of my
way shall I have the Knowledge of Brahman.' The jnanis explain away all three states-
waking, dream, and deep sleep. But the bhaktas accept them all. As long as there is the
ego, everything else exists. So long as the 'I' exists, the bhakta sees that it is God who
has become māyā, the universe, the living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic
principles."
Narendra and the other devotees sat silently listening.
MASTER: "But the theory of māyā is dry. (To Narendra) Repeat what I said."
NARENDRA: "Māyā is dry."
Sri Ramakrishna affectionately stroked Narendra's face and hands and said: "Your face
and hands show that you are a bhakta. But the Jnāni has different features; they are
dry.
Wicked ego and spiritualised ego
"Even after attaining Jnāna, the Jnāni can live in the world, retaining Vidyā-māyā, that is
to say, bhakti, compassion, renunciation, and such virtues. This serves him, twopurposes: first, the teaching of men, and second, the enjoyment of divine bliss. If a
Jnāni remains silent, merged in samādhi, then men's hearts will not be illumined.
Therefore Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge'. And further, a Jnāni lives as a
devotee, in the company of bhaktas, in order to enjoy and drink deep of the Bliss of God.
"The 'ego of Knowledge' and the 'ego of Devotion' can do no harm; it is the 'wicked I'
that is harmful. After realizing God a man becomes like a child. There is no harm in the
'ego of a child'. It is like the reflection of a face in a mirror: the reflection cannot call
names. Or it is like a burnt rope, which appears to be a rope but disappears at the
slightest puff. The ego that has been burnt in the fire of Knowledge cannot injure
anybody. It is an ego only in name."
"Returning to the relative plane after reaching the Absolute is like coming back to this
shore of a river after going to the other side. Such a return to the relative plane is for
the teaching of men and for enjoyment-participation in the divine sport in the world."
Sri Ramakrishna was talking in a very low voice. Addressing the devotees, he said: "The
body is so ill, but the mind is free from Avidyā-māyā. Let me tell you, there is no
thought in my mind of Ramlal or home or wife. But I have been worrying about Purna,
that kayastha boy. I am not in the least anxious about the others.
"It is God alone who has kept this Vidyā-māyā in me, for the good of men, for the
welfare of the devotees.
No liberation for Divine Incarnations
"But if one retains Vidyā-māyā one comes back to this world. The Avatars keep this
Vidyā-māyā. So long as a man has even the slightest desire, he must be born again and
again. When he gets rid of all desires, then he is liberated. But the bhaktas do not seek
liberation.
"If a person dies in Benares he attains liberation; he is not born again. Liberation is the
goal of the jnanis."
NARENDRA: "The other day we went to visit Mahimacharan."
MASTER (smiling): "Well?"
NARENDRA: "I have never before met such a dry Jnāni."
MASTER (smiling): "What was the matter?"
NARENDRA: "He asked us to sing. Gangadhar sang:
Radha is restored to life by hearing her Krishna's name
She looks about; in front of her she sees a tamala tree."On hearing this song, Mahimacharan said: 'Why such songs here? I don't care for love
and all that nonsense. Besides, I live here with my wife and children. Why all these
songs here?' "
MASTER (to M.): "Do you see how afraid he is?"
Sunday, March 14, 1886
Sri Ramakrishna sat facing the north in the large room upstairs. It was evening. He was
very ill. Narendra and Rākhāl were gently massaging his feet. M, sat near by. The
Master, by a sign, asked him, too, to stroke his feet. M. obeyed.
The previous Sunday the devotees had observed Sri Ramakrishna's birthday with
worship and prayer. His birthday the year before had been observed at Dakshineswar
with great pomp; but this year, on account of his illness, the devotees were very sad and
there was no festivity at all.
The Holy Mother busied herself day and night in the Master's service. Among the young
disciples, Narendra, Rākhāl, Niranjan, Sarat, Śaśi, Baburam, Jogin, Lātu, and Kāli had
been staying with him at the garden house. The older devotees visited him daily, and
some of them occasionally spent the night there.
That day Sri Ramakrishna was feeling very ill. At midnight the moonlight flooded the
garden, but it could wake no response in the devotees' hearts. They were drowned in a
sea of grief. They felt that they were living in a beautiful city besieged by a hostile army.
Perfect silence reigned everywhere. Nature was still, except for the gentle rustling of the
leaves at the touch of the south wind. Sri Ramakrishna lay awake. One or two devotees
sat near him in silence. At times he seemed to doze.
Master's great suffering
M. was seated by his side. Sri Ramakrishna asked him by a sign to come nearer. The
sight of his suffering was unbearable. In a very soft voice and with great difficulty he
said to M:
"I have gone on suffering so much for fear of making you all weep. But if you all say:
'Oh, there is so much suffering! Let the body die', then I may give up the body."
These words pierced the devotees' hearts. And he who was their father, mother, and
protector had uttered these words! What could they say? All sat in silence. Some
thought, "Is this another crucifixion-the sacrifice of the body for the sake of the
devotees?"
It was the dead of night. Sri Ramakrishna's illness was taking a turn for the worse. The
devotees wondered what was to be done. One of them left for Calcutta. That very night
Girish came to the garden house with two physicians, Upendra and Navagopal.
The devotees sat near the Master. He felt a little better and said to them: "The illness is
of the body. That is as it should be; I see that the body is made of the five elements."Turning to Girish, he said: "I am seeing many forms of God. Among them I find this one
also [meaning his own form]."
Monday, March 15, 1886
About seven o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna felt a little better. He talked to the
devotees, sometimes in a whisper, sometimes by signs. Narendra, Rākhāl, Lātu, M.,
Gopal of Sinthi, and others were in the room. They sat speechless and looked grave,
thinking of the Master's suffering of the previous night.
His vision of unity
MASTER (to the devotees): "Do you know what I see right now? I see that it is God
Himself who has become all this. It seems to me that men and other living beings are
made of leather, and that it is God Himself who, dwelling inside these leather cases,
moves the hands, the feet, the heads. I had a similar vision once before, when I saw
houses, gardens, roads, men, cattle-all made of One Substance; it was as if they were
all made of wax.
"I see that it is God Himself who has become the block, the executioner, and the victim
for the sacrifice."
As he describes this staggering experience, in which he realizes in full the identity of all
within the One Being, he is overwhelmed with emotion and exclaims, "Ah! What a
vision!"
Immediately Sri Ramakrishna goes into samādhi. He completely forgets his body and the
outer world. The devotees are bewildered. Not knowing what to do, they sit still.
Presently the Master regains partial consciousness of the world and says: "Now I have no
pain at all. I am my old self again."
The devotees are amazed to watch this state of the Master, beyond pleasure and pain,
weal and woe.
He casts his glance on Lātu and says: "There is Loto. He bends his head, resting it on the
palm of his hand. I see that it is God Himself who rests his head on His hand."
Sri Ramakrishna looks at the devotees and his love for them wells up in a thousand
streams. Like a mother showing her tenderness to her children he touches the faces and
chins of Rākhāl and Narendra.
Master about himself
A few minutes later he says to M., "If the body were to be preserved a few days more,
many people would have their spirituality awakened."
He pauses a few minutes.
"But this is not to be. This time the body will not be preserved."The devotees eagerly await the Master's next words.
"Such is not the will of God. This time the body will not be preserved, lest, finding me
guileless and foolish, people should take advantage of me, and lest I, guileless and
foolish as I am, should give away everything to everybody. In this Kaliyuga, you see,
people are averse to meditation and japa."
RĀKHĀL (tenderly): "Please speak to God that He may preserve your body some time
more."
MASTER: "That depends on God's will."
NARENDRA: "Your will and God's will have become one."
Sri Ramakrisna remains silent. He appears to be thinking about something.
MASTER (to Narendra, Rākhāl , and the others): "And nothing will happen if I speak to
God. Now I see that I and the Mother have become one. For fear of her sister-in-law,
Radha said to Krishna, 'Please dwell in my heart.' But when, later on, she became very
eager for a vision of Krishna-so eager that her heart pined and panted for her Beloved-
He would not come out."
RĀKHĀL (in a low voice, to the devotees): "He is referring to God's incarnation as
Gaurānga."
The devotees sit silently in the room. Sri Ramakrishna looks at them tenderly. Then he
places his hand on his heart He is about to speak.
MASTER (to Narendra and the others): "There are two persons in this. One, the Divine
Mother-"
He pauses. The devotees eagerly look at him to hear what he will say next.
MASTER: "Yes, One is She. And the other is Her devotee. It is the devotee who broke his
arm, and it is the devotee who is now ill. Do you understand?"
The devotees sit without uttering a word.
MASTER: "Alas! To whom shall I say all this? Who will understand me?" Pausing a few
moments, he says:
"God becomes man, an Avatār, and comes to earth with His devotees. And the devotee
leave the world with Him."
RĀKHĀL : "Therefore we pray that you may not go away and leave us behind."
Sri Ramakrishna smiles and says:"A band of minstrels suddenly appears, dances, and sings, and it departs in the same
sudden manner. They come and they return, but none recognizes them."
The Master and the devotees smile.
After a few minutes he says:
"Suffering is inevitable when one assumes a human body.
"Every now and then I say to myself, 'May I not have to come back to earth again!' But
there is something else. After enjoying sumptuous feasts outside, one does not relish
cheap home cooking.
"Besides, this assuming of a human body is for the sake of the devotees."
Sri Ramakrishna looks at Narendra very tenderly.
Master teaches Narendra Brahmajnana
MASTER (to Narendra) : "An outcaste was carrying a load of meat. Sankaracharya, after
bathing in the Ganges, was passing by. Suddenly the outcaste touched him. Sankara
said sharply: 'What! You touched me!' 'Revered sir,' he replied, 'I have not touched you
nor have you touched me. Reason with me: Are you the body, the mind, or the buddhi?
Analyse what you are. You are the Pure Ātman, unattached and free, unaffected by the
three Gunās -sattva, rajas, and tamas.'
"Do you know what Brahman is like? It is like air. Good and bad smells are carried by
the air, but the air itself is unaffected."
NARENDRA: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "He is beyond the
Gunās and māyā-beyond both the 'māyā of knowledge' and
the 'māyā of ignorance'.'Woman and gold' is the 'māyā of ignorance'. Knowledge,
renunciation, devotion, and other spiritual qualities are the splendours of the 'māyā of
knowledge'.

"Ego of Knowledge"

Sankaracharya kept this 'māyā of knowledge'; and that you and these others feel
concerned about me is also due to this 'māyā of knowledge'.

"Following the 'māyā of knowledge' step by step, one attains the Knowledge of Brahman.
This 'māyā of knowledge' may be likened to the last few steps of the stairs. Next is the
roof. Some, even after reaching the roof, go up and down the stairs; that is to say, some
even after realizing God, retain the 'ego of Knowledge'. They retain this in order to teach
others, taste divine bliss, and sport with the devotees of God."

NARENDRA: "Some people get angry with me when I speak of renunciation."MASTER (in a whisper): "Renunciation is necessary.
(Pointing to his different limbs) "If one thing is placed upon another, you must remove
the one to get the other. Can you get the second thing without removing the first?"
NARENDRA: "True, sir."
MASTER (in a whisper, to Narendra): "When one sees everything filled with God alone,
does one see anything else?"
NARENDRA: "Must one renounce the world?"
MASTER: "Didn't I say just now: 'When one sees everything filled with God alone, does
one see anything else?' Does one then see any such thing as the world?
"I mean mental renunciation. Not one of those who have come here is a worldly person.
Some of them had a slight desire-for instance, a fancy for woman. (Rākhāl and M.
smile.) And that desire has been fulfilled."
The Master looks at Narendra tenderly and becomes filled with love. Looking at the
devotees, he says, "Grand!"
With a smile Narendra asks the Master, "What is grand?"
MASTER (smiling): "I see that preparations are going on for a grand renunciation."
Narendra and the devotees look silently at the Master. Rākhāl resumes the conversation.
RĀKHĀL (smiling, to the Master): "Narendra is now beginning to understand you rather
well."
Sri Ramakrishna laughs and says: "Yes, that is so. I see that many others, too, are
beginning to understand. (To M.) Isn't that so?"
M: "Yes, sir."


## Narendra and M

Sri Ramakrishna turns his eyes to Narendra and M. and by a sign of his finger draws the
attention of the devotees to them. He first points out Narendra and then M.
Rākhāl understands the Master's hint and says to him with a smile, "Don't you mean that
Narendra has the attitude of a hero, and he [meaning M.] that of a handmaid of God?"

Sri Ramakrishna laughs.

NARENDRA (smiling, to Rākhāl): "He [meaning M.] doesn't talk much and is bashful. Is
that why you say he is a handmaid of God?"MASTER (smiling, to Narendra): "Well, what do you think of me?"

NARENDRA: "You are a hero, a handmaid of God, and everything else."

These words fill Sri Ramakrishna with divine emotion. He places his hand on his heart
and is about to say something.

He says to Narendra and the other devotees:

"I see that all things-everything that exist-have come from this."
He asks Narendra by a sign, "What did you understand?"
NARENDRA: "All created objects have come from you."
The Master's face beams with joy. He says to Rākhāl, "Did you hear what he said?"
Sri Ramakrishna asks Narendra to sing. Narendra intones a hymn. His mind is full of
renunciation. He sings:
Unsteady is water on the lotus petal;
Just as unsteady is the life of man.
One moment with a sādhu is the boat
That takes one across the ocean of this world. . . .
Narendra has hardly finished one or two lines, when Sri Ramakrishna says to him by a
sign: "What are you singing? That is a very insignificant attitude, a very
commonplace thing."
Now Narendra sings about the love of Krishna, impersonating one of His handmaids:
How strange, O friend, are the rules of life and death!
The Youth of Braja has Red away,
And this poor maid of Braja soon will die.
Madhava is in love with other maids
More beautiful than I.

Alas! He has forgotten the milkman's artless daughter.
Who would ever have guessed, dear friend, that He,
A Lover so tender, so divine,
Could be a beggar simply for outward charm?
I was a fool not to have seen it before;
But carried away by His beauty,
I yearned alone to hold His two feet to my breast.
Now I shall drown myself in the Jamuna's stream,
Or take a draught of poison, friend!
Or I shall bind a creeper round my neck,Or hang myself from a young tamala tree;
Or, failing all of these,
Destroy my wretched self by chanting Krishna's name.
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees are greatly moved by the song. The Master and
Rākhāl shed tears of love. Narendra is intoxicated with the love of the gopis of Braja for
their Sweetheart, Sri Krishna, and sings:
O Krishna! Beloved! You are mine.

What shall I say to You, O Lord?

What shall I ever say to You?
Only a woman am I,
And never fortune's favourite;
I do not know what to say.
You are the mirror for the hand,
And You are the flower for the hair.
O Friend, I shall make a flower of You
And wear You in my hair;
Under my braids I shall hide You, Friend!
No one will see You there.
You are the betel-leaf for the lips,
The sweet collyrium for the eyes;
O Friend, with You I shall stain my lips,
With You I shall paint my eyes.
You are the sandal-paste for the body;
You are the necklace for the neck.
I shall anoint myself with You,
My fragrant Sandal-paste,
And soothe my body and my soul.
I shall wear You, my lovely Necklace,
Here about my neck,
And You will lie upon my bosom,
Close to my throbbing heart.
You are the Treasure in my body;
You are the Dweller in my house.
You are to me, O Lord,
What wings are to the flying bird,
What water is to the fish.
