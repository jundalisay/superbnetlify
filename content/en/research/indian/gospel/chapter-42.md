Monday, July 13, 1885

SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in Balarām's drawing-room with the devotees. It was nine o'clock in the morning. Balarām was going to celebrate the Car Festival the following
day. The Deity Jagannath was worshipped daily at his house. He had a small car which would be drawn along the verandah to celebrate the festival. The Master had been
specially invited for the occasion.

Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking together. Narayan, Tejchandra, Balarām, and other
devotees were in the room. The Master was talking about Purna, a lad of fifteen. He was
very eager to see the boy.

MASTER (to M.): Well, by which road will he come to see me? Please have Purna and
Dwija meet each other.

"When two people are of the same age and have the same inner nature, I bring them
together. There is a meaning in this. In this way both make progress. Have you noticed
Purna's longing for God?"

M: "Yes, sir. One day I was riding on a tram. He saw me from the room of his house and
ran down to the street. With great fervour he saluted me from the street."
MASTER (with tears in his eyes): "Ah! Ah! It is because you have helped him make the
contact through which he will find out the supreme ideal of his life. One doesn't act like
that unless one longs for God.
"Narendra, the younger Naren, and Purna-these three have a manly nature. It is not so
with Bhavanāth. He has a womanly nature.
Master on Purna
"Purna is in such an exalted state that either he will very soon give up his body-the body
is useless after the realization of God-or his inner nature will within a few days burst
forth.
Purna's divine traits
"He has a divine nature-the traits of a god. It makes a person less fearful of men. If you
put a garland of flowers round his neck or smear his body with sandal-paste or burn
incense before him, he will go into samādhi; for then he will know beyond the shadow of
a doubt that Narayana Himself dwells in his body, that it is Narayana who has assumed
the body. I have come to know about it.
A few days after my first experience of the God-intoxicated state at Dakshineswar, a
lady of a brahmin family arrived there. She had many good traits. No sooner was a
garland put round her neck and incense burnt before her than she went into samādhi. A
880few moments later she experienced great bliss; tears streamed from her eyes. I saluted
her and said, 'Mother, shall I succeed?' 'Yes', she replied.
"I want to see Purna once more. But how will it be possible for me? It seems he is a
part. How amazing! Not a mere particle, but a part very intelligent, too. I understand
that he is very clever in his studies. Therefore I have hit it right.
"By dint of austerity, a man, may obtain God as his son. By the roadside on the way to
Kamarpukur is Ranjit Raya's lake. Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, was born as his
daughter. Even now people hold an annual festival there in the month of Chaitra, in
honour of this divine daughter. I feel very much like going there.
Story of Ranjit Raya
"Ranjit Raya was the landlord of that part of the country. Through the power of his
tapasya he obtained the Divine Mother as his daughter. He was very fond of her, and she
too was much attached to him; she hardly left his presence. One day Ranjit Raya was
engaged in the duties of his estate. He was very busy. The girl, with her childlike nature,
was constantly interrupting him, saying: 'Father, what is this? What is that?' Ranjit Raya
tried, with sweet words, to persuade her not to disturb him, and said: 'my child, please
leave me alone. I have much work to do.' But the girl would not go away. At last,
absent-mindedly, the father said, 'Get out of here!' On this pretext she left home. A
pedlar of conch-shell articles was going along the road. From him she took a pair of
bracelets for her wrists. When he asked for the price, she said that he could get the
money from a certain box in her home. Then she disappeared. Nobody saw her again. In
the mean time the pedlar came to the house and asked for the price of his bracelets.
When she was not to be found at home, her relatives began to run about looking for her.
Ranjit Raya sent people in all directions to search for her. The money owed to the pedlar
was found in the box, as she had indicated. Ranjit Raya was weeping bitterly, when
people came running to him and said that they had noticed something in the lake. They
all ran there and saw an arm, with conch-shell bracelets on the wrist, being waved above
the water. A moment afterwards it disappeared. Even now people worship her as the
Divine Mother at the time of the annual festival. (To M.) All this is true.
M: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Narendra now believes these things.
"Purna was born with an element of Vishnu. I worshipped him mentally with bel-leaves;
but the offering was not accepted. Then I worshipped him with tulsi-leaves and sandal-
paste. That proved to be all right. God reveals Himself in many ways: sometimes as
man, sometimes in other divine forms made of Spirit. One must believe in divine forms.
What do you say?"
M: "It is true, sir!"
881Gopal Ma
MASTER: "The brahmani of Kamarhati sees many visions. She lives all by herself in a
lonely room in a garden on the bank of the Ganges. She spends her time in japa. Gopala
sleeps with her. (The Master gives a start.) It is not imagination, but fact. She saw that
Gopala's palms were red. He walks with her. She suckles Him at her breast. They talk to
each other. When Narendra heard the story he wept. Formerly I too used to see many
visions, but now in my ecstatic state I don't see so many. I am gradually getting over
my feminine nature; I feel nowadays more like a man. Therefore I control my emotion; I
don't manifest it outwardly so much.
"The younger Naren has the nature of a man. Therefore in meditation his mind
completely merges in the Ideal. He does not show emotion. Nitya-gopal has a feminine
nature. Therefore while he is in a spiritual mood his body becomes distorted and twisted;
it becomes flushed.
(To M.) "Well, people renounce grain by grain, but what a mood these youngsters are in!
"Binode said: 'I have to sleep with my wife. That makes me feel very bad.' It is bad for
an aspirant to sleep with his wife, whether he has intercourse with her or not. There is
the friction of the body and also the physical warmth.
"What a state Dwija is passing through! In my presence he only sways his body and fixes
his glance on me. Is that a trifling thing? If a man gathers his whole, mind and fixes it
on me, then, indeed, he achieves everything.
God dwelling in the Master
"But what am I? It is all He. I am the machine and He is its Operator. It is God alone
who exists in this [meaning his body]. That is why so many people are feeling more and
more attracted to it. A mere touch is enough to awaken their spirituality. This attraction,
these pull, is the attraction of God and of none else.
"Tārak of Belgharia was going home from Dakshineswar. I dearly noticed that a flame-
like thing came out of this [meaning his body] and followed him. A few days later Tārak
came back to Dakshineswar. In a state of samādhi He Who dwells in this body placed his
foot on Tārak's chest.
"Well, are there more youngsters like these?"
M: "Mohit is very nice. He came to you once or twice. He is studying enough books to
pass two university examinations. He has great longing for God."
MASTER: "That maybe. But he doesn't belong to a high plane. His physical traits are not
so good; he has a puggish face. But these other youngsters belong to a high plane.
882Worries associated with human birth
"Many troubles and worries follow in the wake of a birth in a physical body. Further, if a
person is cursed, he may have to be born seven times. One must be very careful. One
has to assume a human body if one cherishes the slightest desire."
A DEVOTEE: "What are the desires of those who are Incarnations of God?"
MASTER (smiling): "I find that I have not got rid of all my desires. Once I saw a holy
man with a shawl, and I too wanted to put on one like it. Even now I have that desire. I
don't know whether I shall have to be born again for it."
BALARĀM (smiling): "Then will you be born again just for a shawl?" (All laugh.)
MASTER (smiling): "One has to keep a good desire so that one may give up the body
meditating on it. There are four holy places for the sādhus to visit. They visit three and
leave out one. Many of them leave out Puri, the place of Jagannath, so that they can
give up their bodies meditating on Jagannath."
A man dressed in an ochre robe entered the room and greeted the Master. Privately he
was in the habit of criticizing Sri Ramakrishna; so at the sight of him Balarām laughed.
Sri Ramakrishna could read a man's mind. He said to Balarām: "Never mind. Let him say
I am a cheat."
Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Tejchandra.
MASTER: "I send for you so often. Why don't you come? If you practise meditation and
prayer it will make me happy. I look on you as my own; that is why I send for you."
TEJCHANDRA: "Sir, I have to go to the office. I am very busy with my duties."
M. (smiling): "There was a marriage ceremony at his home and he got leave from his
office for ten days."
MASTER: "Well, well! You say you have no leisure. You told me just now that you were
going to renounce the world."
NARAYAN: "M. said to us one day that this world, is a wilderness."
MASTER (to M.): "Please tell them that story of the disciple who became unconscious
after taking the medicine. His teacher arrived at the house and said he would revive if
someone else swallowed a pill that he would prescribe. The disciple would get back his
life, but the man who, swallowed the pill would die.
"Please tell the other one, too, of the hathayogi who thought that his wife and children
were his very own, and who feigned death with his limbs stretched out. It will do them
good to hear those stories."
883It was noon. Sri Ramakrishna partook of the food that had been offered to the Family
Deity, Jagannath. The Master often used to say that the food at Balarām's house was
very pure. Afterwards he rested awhile.
Late in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna sat with the devotees in the drawing-room of
Balarām's house. Chandra Babu, of the Kartabhaja sect, and a witty brahmin were there.
The brahmin was something of a buffoon; his words made everybody laugh.
About six o'clock Girish's brother Atul and Tejchandra's brother arrived. Sri Ramakrishna
was in samādhi. A few minutes later he said, still in the ecstatic mood: "Can one become
unconscious by meditating on Consciousness? Can one lose one's mind by thinking of
God? God is of the very nature of Knowledge; He is of the very nature of Eternity, Purity,
and Consciousness.
Sri Ramakrishna said to the witty brahmin: "Why do you waste your time with these
frivolous jokes about insignificant worldly things? Direct your mind to God. If a man can
calculate about salt, he can also calculate about sugar candy."
BRAHMIN (smiling): "Please attract me."
MASTER: "What can I do? Everything depends on your effort. Your mind is your own.
Give up this trifling buffoonery and go forward toward God. You can go farther and
farther along that way. The brahmachari asked the wood-cutter to go forward. At first
the wood-cutter found a sandal-wood forest; next, a silver-mine; next, a gold-mine; and
then gems and diamonds."
BRAHMIN: "There is no end to this path."
MASTER: "Where you find peace, there is the end."
About a new visitor Sri Ramakrishna said: "I didn't find any substance in him. He
seemed worthless."
It was dusk. Lamps were lighted in the room. Sri Ramakrishna was meditating on the
Divine Mother and chanting Her name in his melodious voice. The devotees sat around
him. Since Balarām was going to celebrate the Car Festival at his house the following
day, Sri Ramakrishna intended to spend the night there.
After taking some refreshments in the inner apartments, Sri Ramakrishna returned to
the parlour. It was about ten o'dock. The Master said to M., "Please bring my towel from
the other room." A bed was made for Sri Ramakrishna in the adjoining small room.
About half past ten Sri Ramakrishna lay down to sleep. It was summertime. He said to
M., "You had better bring a fan." He asked the disciple to fan him. At midnight Sri
Ramakrishna woke up. He said to M., "Don't fan me any more; I feel chilly."
Tuesday, July 14, 1885
It was the day of the Car Festival. Sri Ramakrishna left his bed very early in the
morning. He was alone in the room, dancing and chanting the name of God. M. entered
884and saluted the Master. Other devotees arrived one by one. They saluted the Master and
took seats near him. Sri Ramakrishna was longing intensely for Purna. He was talking to
M. about him.
MASTER: "Did you give Purna any instruction?"
M: "I asked him to read the life of Chaitanya. He is familiar with the incidents of his life.
I told him further that you ask people to stick to the truth."
MASTER: "How did he take it when you said about me, 'He is an Incarnation of God'?"
M: "I said to him, 'Come with me If you want to see a person like Chaitanya.'"
MASTER: "Anything else?"
M: "Also that remark of yours that when an elephant enters a small pool there is a great
splashing of water all around; likewise, in the case of a 'small receptacle', emotion
overflows. "About his giving up of fish, I said to him: 'Why have you done that? Your
family will make a great fuss about it.' "
MASTER: "That's good. One should keep one's feelings and emotions to oneself."
It was about half past six in the morning. M. was going to bathe in the Ganges, when
suddenly tremors of an earthquake were felt. At once he returned to Sri Ramakrishna's
room. The Master stood in the drawing room. The devotees stood around him. They
were talking about the earthquake. The shaking had been rather violent, and many of
the devotees were frightened.
M: "You should all have gone downstairs."
MASTER: "Such is the fate of the house under whose roof one lives; and still people are
so egotistic. (To M.) Do you remember the great storm of the month of Āświn?"
M: "Yes, sir. I was very young at that time-nine or ten years old. I was alone in a room
while the storm was raging, and I prayed to God."
M. was surprised and said to himself: "Why did the Master suddenly ask me about the
great storm of Āświn? Does he know that I was alone at that time earnestly praying to
God with tears in my eyes? Does he know all this? Has he been protecting me as my
guru since my very birth?"
MASTER: "It was quite late in the day at Dakshineswar when the storm broke, but
somehow they managed to cook the meals. The trees were uprooted. You see, this is the
fate of the house one lives in.
885Nitya and Lila
"But when one attains Perfect Knowledge, then one finds that dying and killing are one
and the same thing; that is to say, both are unreal. When one is dead, one has not really
died; and when one has killed another, the man is not really dead. Both the Lila and the
Nitya belong to the same Reality. In one form It is the Absolute, and in another, the Lila.
Even though the Lila is destroyed, the Nitya always exists. Water is water, whether it is
still or in waves; it is the same water when the waves quiet down."
Sri Ramakrishna sat in the drawing-room with the devotees. Mahendra Mukherji, Hari,
the younger Naren, and many other devotees were there. Hari lived alone and studied
Vedānta. He was about twenty-three years old, and unmarried. Sri Ramakrishna was
very fond of him. He wanted Hari to visit him frequently. But since Hari loved solitude he
did not often come to the Master.
MASTER (to Hari): "Well, I haven't seen you for a long time."
Essence of Vedānta & Absolute and Relative are correlatives
"You see, in one form He is the Absolute and in another He is the Relative. What does
Vedānta teach? Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. Isn't that so? But as long
as God keeps the 'ego of a devotee' in a man, the Relative is also real. When He
completely effaces the ego, then what is remains. That cannot be described by the
tongue. But as long as God keeps the ego, one must accept all. By removing the outer
sheaths of the plantain-tree, you reach the inner pith. As long as the tree contains
sheaths, it also contains pith. So too, as long as it contains pith, it also contains sheaths.
The pith goes with the sheaths and the sheaths go with the pith. In the same way, when
you speak of the Nitya, it is understood that the Lila also exists; and when you speak of
the Lila, it is understood that the Nitya also exists.
Brahman and Śakti
"It is He alone who has become the universe, living beings, and thetwenty-four cosmic
principles. When He is action less, I call Him Brahman; when He creates, preserves, and
destroys, I call Him Śakti. Brahman and Śakti are not different from each other. Water is
water, whether it is still or moving.
"It is not possible to rid oneself of 'I-consciousness' and as long as one is aware of this
'I-consciousness', one cannot speak of the universe and its living beings as unreal. You
cannot get the correct weight of the bel-fruit if you leave out its shell and pits.
"The brick, lime, and brick-dust of which the stairs are made are the same brick, lime,
and brick-dust of which the roof is made. The universe and its living beings exist on
account of the Reality of Him who is known as Brahman.
Synthesis of the formless Reality and God with form
"The devotees-I mean the vijnanis-accept both God with form and the Formless, both
the Personal God and the Impersonal. In a shoreless ocean-an infinite expanse of water-
visible blocks of ice are formed here and there by intense cold. Similarly, under the
886cooling influence, so to say, of the deep love of Its worshipper, the Infinite reduces Itself
to the finite and appears before the worshipper as God with form. Again, as, on the
rising of the sun, the ice melts away, so, on the awakening of Knowledge, God with form
melts away into the same Infinite and Formless.
"As long as a man analyses with the mind, he cannot reach the Absolute. As long as you
reason with your mind, you have no way of getting rid of the universe and the objects of
the senses-form, taste, smell, touch, and sound. When reasoning stops, you attain the
Knowledge of Brahman. Ātman cannot be realized through this mind; Ātman is realized
through Ātman alone. Pure Mind, Pure Buddhi, Pure Ātman-all these are one and the
same.
"Just think how many things you need to perceive an object. You need eyes; you need
light; you need mind. You cannot perceive the object if you leave out anyone of these
three. As long as the mind functions how can you say that the universe and the 'I' do not
exist?
"When the mind is annihilated, when it stops deliberating pro and con, then one goes
into samādhi, one attains the Knowledge of Brahman. You know the seven notes of the
scale: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni. One cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' very long."
Intimate Knowledge of God
Looking at the younger Naren, Sri Ramakrishna said: "What will you gain by merely
being intuitively aware of God's existence? A mere vision of God is by no means
everything. You have to bring Him into your room. You have to talk to Him.
"Some have heard of milk, some have seen milk, and some have drunk milk. Some have
seen the king, but only one or two can bring the King home and entertain him."
M. went to the Ganges to take his bath. It was ten o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna was still
talking with the devotees. After finishing his bath, M. returned to Balarām's house. He
saluted the Master and sat down near him.
Sri Ramakrishna was filled with intense spiritual fervour. Words of wisdom flowed from
him. Now and then he narrated his profound mystical experiences to the devotees.
Master's spiritual experiences
MASTER: "I went to Benares with Mathur Babu. Our boat was passing the Manikarnika
Ghat on the Ganges, when suddenly I had a vision of Śiva. I stood near the edge of the
boat and went into samādhi. The boatman, fearing that I might fall into the water, cried
to Hriday: 'Catch hold of him! Catch hold of him!' I saw Śiva standing on that Ghat,
embodying in Himself all the seriousness of the world. At first I saw Him standing at a
distance; then I saw Him approaching me. At last he merged in me.
"Another time, in an ecstatic mood, I saw that a sannyāsi was leading me by the hand.
We entered a temple and I had a vision of Annapurna made of gold.
"God alone has become all this; but He manifests Himself more in certain things than in
others.
887(To M.) "Perhaps you do not believe in the salagram. 'Englishmen' do not believe in it. It
doesn't matter whether you believe in it or not. A salagram should contain the mark of a
disc and other signs; only then can it be worshipped as an emblem of God."
M: "Yes, sir. It is like the fuller manifestation of God in a man with good physical traits.'"
MASTER: "At first Narendra used to say that these were figments of my imagination; but
now he accepts everything."
Sri Ramakrishna was describing the vision of God, when he went into samādhi. The
devotees looked at him with fixed gaze. After a long time he regained consciousness of
the world and talked to the devotees.
MASTER (to M.): "What do you think I saw? I saw the whole universe as a salagram, and
in it I saw your two eyes."
In silent wonder M. and the devotees listened to these words about his inner experience.
At this moment Sarada, another' young disciple of the Master, entered the room and
saluted him.
MASTER (to Sarada): "Why don't you come to Dakshineswar? Why don't you see me
when I come to Calcutta?"
SARADA: "Nobody tells me about it."
MASTER: "Next time I shall let you know. (To M., smiling) Make a list of these
youngsters." (M. and the devotees laugh.)
SARADA: "My relatives at home want me to marry. (pointing to M.) How many times he
has scolded me about marriage!"
MASTER: "Why should you marry just now? (To M.) Sarada is now in a very good state
of mind. Formerly he had a hesitant look; now his face beams with joy."
Sri Ramakrishna said to a devotee, "Will you kindly fetch Purna?"
Narendra arrived. Sri Ramakrishna asked a devotee to give him some refreshments. He
was greatly pleased at the sight of Narendra. When he fed Narendra, he felt that he was
feeding Narayana Himself. He stroked Narendra's body affectionately.
Spiritual fervour of Gopal Ma
Gopal Ma entered the room. She was a great devotee of Gopala and was blessed with
many lofty spiritual visions. Sri Ramakrishna had asked Balarām to send a man to bring
her from Kamarhati. As soon as she entered the room she said, "I am shedding tears of
joy." With these words she bowed before the Master, touching the ground with her
forehead.
888MASTER: "What is this? You address me as 'Gopala' and still you salute me! Now go into
the inner apartments and cook some curry for me. Put some spicy seasoning in it so that
I may get the smell from here." (All laugh.
GOPAL MA: "What will they [meaning the members of the household] think of me?"
Before she left the room she said to Narendra in a very fervent voice, "My child, have I
reached the goal, or have I farther to go?"
It was the day of the Car Festival; so there was some delay in the worship of the Family
Deity. When the worship was finished Sri Ramakrishna was asked to have his meal. He
went to the inner apartments. The woman devotees were anxious to see him.
Man and woman devotees
Sri Ramakrishna had many woman devotees, but he did not talk much about them to his
man devotees. He would warn the men against visiting woman devotees. He would say:
"Don't overdo it. Otherwise you will slip." To some of his man devotees he would say,
"Don't go near a woman even if she rolls on the ground with devotion." The Master
wanted the men to live apart from woman devotees; only thus would the two groups
make progress. He did not like the woman devotees to caress the men as "Gopala"; for
too much of this motherly affection was not good; it degenerated in time into a harmful
relationship.
After his midday meal Sri Ramakrishna sat in the drawing-room with the devotees. It
was one o'clock. A devotee brought Purna from his home. With great joy the Master
exclaimed to M.: "Here he is! Purna has come." Narendra, the younger Naren, Narayan,
Haripada, and other devotees were talking with the Master.
Free will
THE YOUNGER NAREN: "Sir, have we any free will?"
MASTER: "Just try to find out who this 'I' is. While you are searching for 'I', 'He' comes
out. 'I am the machine and He is the Operator.' You have heard of a mechanical toy that
goes into a store with a letter in its hand. You are like that toy. God alone is the Doer.
Do your duties in the world as if you were the doer, but knowing all the time that God
alone is the Doer and you are the instrument.
"As long as the Upādhi exists there is ignorance. 'I am a scholar', 'I am a Jnāni', 'I am
wealthy', 'I am honourable', 'I am the master, father, and teacher' -all these ideas are
begotten of ignorance. 'I am the machine and You are the Operator' - that is Knowledge.
In the state of Knowledge all Upādhis are destroyed. When the log is burnt up entirely,
there is no more sound; no heat either. Everything cools down. Peace! Peace! Peace! (To
Narendra) Sing a little."
NARENDRA "I must go home. I have many things to do."
889MASTER: "Yes, yes, my child! Why should you listen to us? 'The words of those who
have gold in their ears are valuable; no one listens to him who hasn't even a rag round
his waist.' (All laugh.) You frequent the garden house of the Guhas. I always hear about
it. Whenever I ask, 'Where is Narendra today?' I am told, 'Oh, he has gone to the
Guhas.' I should not have said all these things, but you have wrung them out of me."
Narendra kept quiet a few moments. Then he said: "There are no instruments to
accompany me. Shall I just sing?"
MASTER: "My child, this is all we have. Please sing if it suits you. You must know how
Balarām arranges things. "Balarām says to me, 'Please come to Calcutta by boat; take a
carriage only if you must.' (All laugh.) You see, he has given us a feast today; so this
afternoon he will make us all dance! (All laugh.) One day he hired a carriage for me from
here to Dakshineswar. He said that the carriage hire was twelve ānnās . I said to him,
'Will the coachman take me to Dakshineswar for twelve ānnās ?' 'Oh, that will be plenty',
he replied. One side of the carriage broke down before we reached Dakshineswar. (All
laugh.) Besides, the horse stopped every now and then; it simply would not go. Once in
a while the coachman whipped the horse, and then it ran a short distance. (All laugh.)
The program for the evening is that Ram will play on the drum and we shall all dance.
Ram has no sense of rhythm. (All laugh.) Anyhow, that is Balarām's attitude-sing
yourselves, dance yourselves, and make yourselves happy!" (All laugh.)
Other devotees were arriving. Mahendra Mukherji saluted the Master from a distance.
The Master returned the salute. Then he salaamed to Mahendra like a Mussulman.
The Master said to a young devotee who sat next to him: "Why don't you tell him I have
salaamed to him? He will appreciate it (All laugh.)
Many of the householder devotees were accompanied by their wives and other woman
relatives. They wanted to salute the Master and watch his dancing before the car. Ram,
Girish, and other devotees gradually assembled. Many young devotees were present.
Narendra sang:
Oh, when will dawn the blessed day
When Love will waken in my heart?
When will my tears flow uncontrolled
As I repeat Lord Hari's name,
And all my longing be fulfilled?
When will my mind and soul be pure?
Oh, when shall I at last repair
Unto Vrindāvan's sacred groves?
When will my worldly bonds fall off
And my imperfect sight be healed
By Wisdom's cool collyrium?
When shall I learn true alchemy
And, touching the Philosopher's Stone,
Transmute my body's worthless iron
890Into the Spirit's purest gold?
When shall I see this very world
As God, and roll on Love's highway?
When shall I give up piety
And duty and the thought of caste?
When shall I leave behind all fear,
All shame, convention, worry, pride?
Oh, I shall smear my body then
With dust from the feet of devotees;
Across my shoulders I shall sling
Renunciation's pack, and drink
From my two hands a cooling draught
Of Jamunas life-renewing stream.
Oh, then I shall be mad with love;
I shall both laugh and weep for joy!
Then I shall swim, upon the Sea,
Of blessed Satchidananda;
Drunk with His love, I shall make all
As drunk as I! Oh, I shall sport
At Hari's feet for evermore!
He sang again:
In dense darkness, O Mother, Thy formless beauty sparkles;
Therefore the, yogis meditate in a dark mountain cave
Balarām had arranged for kirtan with Vaishnavcharan, the musician Vaishnavcharan
sang:
O tongue, always repeat, the name of Mother Durga;
Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress? . . .
When Sri Ramakrishna had heard a line or two of the song he went into samādhi. He
stood up in that ecstatic mood, The younger Naren supported him. The Master's face was
lighted with a smile. Gradually his body became motionless; his mind appeared to have
gone to another realm. All the devotees in the room looked at him in amazement. The
woman devotees watched the scene from behind the screen. After a long time he came
down from samādhi, chanting the holy name of God.
As the Master sat down, Vaishnavcharan sang again:
O vina, sing Lord Hari's name!
Without the blessing of His feet
You cannot know the final Truth,
The name of Hari slays all grief:
Sing Hari's name! Sing Krishna's name! . . .
Then he sang:
891O vina, forgetting to worship Hari,
I pass the days of my life in vain. . . .
The Car Festival
It was afternoon. In the mean time the small car of Jagannath, decorated with flowers,
flags, and bunting, had been brought to the inner verandah. The images of Jagannath,
Subhadra, and Balarama, were adorned with sandal-paste, flower garlands, robes and
jewelry. Sri Ramakrishna left the room where the professional musicians were singing
and came to the verandah, accompanied by the devotees. He stood in front of the car
and pulled it by the rope. He began to sing and dance with the devotees in front of the
car.
The Master sang:
Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep
while chanting Hari's name. . . .
He sang again:
See how all Nadia is shaking
Under the waves of Gaurānga's love! . . .
The music and dancing went on in the verandah as the car was pulled to and fro. A large
crowd entered the house on hearing the loud music and the beating of the drums. Sri
Ramakrishna was completely intoxicated with divine love. The devotees felt its contagion
and danced with the Master in an ecstasy of love.
Afterwards Sri Ramakrishna returned to the drawing-room. M. and other devotees
stroked his feet.
Filled with divine fervour, Narendra sang to the accompaniment of the Tānpura:
Come! Come, Mother! Doll of my soul! My heart's' Delight!
In my heart's lotus come and sit, that I may see Thy face
Then he sang:
Mother, Thou art our sole Redeemer,
Thou the Support of the three Gunās,
Higher than the most high.
Thou art compassionate, I know;
Who takest away our bitter grief.
Sandhya art Thou, and Gayatri;
Thou dost sustain this universe.
Mother, the Help art Thou
Of those that have no help but thee,
O Eternal Beloved of Śiva!
Thou art in earth, in water Thou;
Thou liest at the root of all.
In me, in every creature,
892Thou hast Thy home; though clothed with form,
Yet art Thou formless Reality
He sang another song:
I have made Thee, O Lord, the Pole-star of my life;
No more shall I lose my way on the world's trackless sea.
Wherever I wander here, Thy brilliance shines undimmed;
With Thy serene and gracious light
Thou drivest all the tears out of my troubled soul.
In my heart's inmost shrine Thy face for ever beams;
If, for a moment even, I cannot find it there,
My soul is overwhelmed with woe;
And when my witless mind strays from the thought of Thee,
The vision of Thy face strikes me with deepest shame.
A devotee said to Narendra, "Will you sing that one - 'O Mother, Thou my Inner Guide,
ever awake within my heart'?"
MASTER: "Oh, no! Why that song now? The proper thing now is to sing of divine bliss-a
song like 'O Mother Syama, full of the waves of drunkenness divine'."
Narendra sang:
O Mother Syama, full of the waves of drunkenness divine!
Who knows how Thou dost sport in the world?
Thy fun and frolic and Thy glances put to shame the god of
love.
O Wielder of the sword! O Thou of terrifying face!
The earth itself is shaken under Thy leaps and strides!
O Thou Abode of the three Gunās! O Redeemer! Fearsome
One!
Thou who art the Consort of Śiva!
Many the forms Thou dost assume, fulfilling Thy bhaktas'
prayers.
Thou dancest in the Lotus of the Heart,
O Mother, Eternal Consort of Brahman!
Full of divine ecstasy, Narendra sang again and again the lines:
Thou dancest in the Lotus of the Heart,
O Mother, Eternal Consort of Brahman!
Sri Ramakrishna was dancing, drunk with divine love, and he sang again and again, "O
Mother, Eternal Consort of Brahman!"
893After dancing a long time Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat. He was very much pleased
to see Narendra in a spiritual mood, singing with tears in his eyes.
It was about nine o'clock in the evening. The devotees still sat around the Master.
Vaishnavcharan sang about Gaurānga:
The beautiful Gaurānga, the youthful dancer, fair as molten
gold. . . .
Next he sang about Sri Krishna. Krishna had left His pastoral life in Vrindāvan and
become the king of Mathura. A gopi met Him there and said:
O Hari, how shall we know You now?
In Mathura's royal splendour you have forgotten us.
Now, in your kingly robes, you ride an elephant;
Have you utterly forgotten how in Vrindāvan You tended cows?
O Hari, have you forgotten how you would steal the butter
From Braja's innocent gopi maids?
About eleven o'clock the devotees saluted the Master and were departing one by one.
MASTER: "You may all go. (Pointing to Narendra and the younger Naren) It will be
enough if these two stay. (To Girish) Will you eat your supper at home? You may stay a
few minutes if you want to. You want a smoke! But Balarām's servant is just like his
master. Ask him for a smoke; he won't give it! (All laugh.) But don't go away without
having your smoke."
Girish had brought with him a respectable friend. The latter observed all these things
and left the place. Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish: "I say this to you and to everyone:
Please do not force anybody to come here. Nothing happens except at the right time."
Before leaving, a devotee saluted the Master. He had a young boy with him. Sri
Ramakrishna said to him affectionately, "It is getting late, and you have this boy with
you." Narendra, the younger Naren, and a few other devotees stayed awhile and then
took their leave.
Wednesday, July 15, 1885
It was four, o'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was in bed in the small room next
to the drawing-room. M. was sitting on a bench on the outer verandah to the south of
the room. A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna came out to the verandah. M. saluted
him.
MASTER: "I have already been up once. Well, shall we go to Dakshineswar this
morning?"
M: "The Ganges is less choppy in the morning."
Day was gradually breaking. The devotees had not yet arrived. Sri Ramakrishna had
washed his mouth and was chanting the names of God in his sweet voice. He stood near
894the north door of the room. M. was by his side. A few minutes later Gopal Ma arrived and
stood near him. One or two woman devotees were looking at the Master from behind the
doors of the inner apartments. They were like the gopis of Vrindāvan looking at Sri
Krishna, or the woman devotees of Nadia looking at Gaurānga from behind the screen.
After chanting the name of Rāma, Sri Ramakrishna chanted the name of Krishna:
"Krishna! Krishna! Krishna of the gopis! Gopi! Gopi! Krishna, the Life of the cowherd
boys of Vrindāvan! Krishna, the son of Nanda! Govinda! Govinda!"
Next he chanted the name of Gaurānga. Then he repeated, "Ālekh Niranjana", which is a
name of God. Saying, "Niranjana", he wept. The devotees wept too. With tears in his
eyes the Master said: "O Niranjan! O my child! Come! Eat this! Take this! When shall I
make my life blessed by feeding you? You have assumed this human form for my sake."
He prayed to Jagannath in a very touching voice:
"O Jagannath, Lord of the Universe! O Friend of the world! O Friend of the poor! I am
not, O Lord, outside Thy universe. Be gracious to me!"
While he sang in praise of Jagannath he was beside himself with divine love.
Now he chanted the name of Narayana . He danced and sang:
"O Narayana ! O Narayana ! Narayana ! Narayana !"
He danced and sang again:
Ah, friend! I have not found Him yet, whose love has driven me
mad. . . .
Afterwards the Master sat in the small room with the devotees. He was completely
stripped of his clothes, like a five-year-old child. M., Balarām, and a few other devotees
were in the room.
MASTER: "One can see God's form. One sees God when all Upādhis disappear and
reasoning stops. Then a man becomes speechless and goes into samādhi. Coming to the
theatre, people indulge in all kinds of gossip. But the moment the curtain goes up, all
conversation stops; the spectators become fully absorbed in what they see on the stage.
Master's love for young disciples
"I want to tell you something very secret. Why do I love boys like Purna and Narendra so
much? Once, in a spiritual mood, I felt intense love for Jagannath, love such as a woman
feels for her sweetheart. In that mood I was about to embrace Him; when I broke my
arm. It was then revealed to me: 'You have assumed this human body. Therefore
establish with human beings the relationship of friend, father, mother, or son.'
895"I now feel for Purna and the other young boys as I once felt for Rāmlāla. I used to
bathe Rāmlāla, feed Him, put Him to bed, and take Him wherever I went. I used to weep
for Rāmlāla. Now I have the same feeling for these young boys. Look at Niranjan. He is
not attached to anything. He spends money from his own pocket to take poor patients to
the hospital. At the proposal of marriage he says, 'Goodness! That is the whirlpool of the
Visalaks! I see him seated on a light. "Purna belongs to the realm of the Personal God.
He was born with an element of Vishnu. Ah, what yearning he has!
(To M.) "Didn't you notice that he looked at you as if you were his spiritual brother, his
very own? He said he would visit me again, at Captain's house.
Master's praise of Narendra
"Narendra belongs to a very high plane-the realm of the Absolute. He has a manly
nature. So many devotees come here, but there is not one like him.
"Every now and then I take stock of the devotees. I find that some are like lotuses with
ten petals, some like lotuses with sixteen petals, some like lotuses with a hundred
petals. But among lotuses Narendra is a thousand-petalled one.
"Other devotees may be like pots or pitchers; but Narendra is a huge water-barrel.
"Others may be like pools or tanks; but Narendra is a huge reservoir like the
Haldārpukur.
"Among fish, Narendra is a huge red-eyed carp; others are like minnows or smelts or
sardines. Tārak of Belgharia may be called a bass.
"Narendra is a 'very big receptacle', one that can hold many things. He is like a bamboo
with a big hollow space inside.
"Narendra is not under the control of anything. He is not under the control of attachment
or sense pleasures. He is like a male pigeon. If you hold a male pigeon by its beak, it
breaks away from you; but the female pigeon keeps still. Narendra has the nature of a
man; so he sits on the right side in a carriage. Bhavanāth has a woman's nature; so I
make him sit on the other side. I feel great strength when Narendra is with me in a
gathering."
About eight o'clock in the morning Mahendra Mukherji arrived and saluted the Master.
Haripada, Tulsiram and other devotees arrived one by one and saluted him. Baburam
was laid up with fever and could not come.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Hasn't the younger Naren come? Perhaps he thought I
had left. (To Mukherji) How amazing! Even during his boyhood, on returning from
school, he cried for God. Is it a small thing to cry for God? He is very intelligent, too. He
is like a bamboo with a big hollow space inside. All of his mind is fixed on me.
896Girish Ghosh said to me: The younger Naren went to Navagopal's house when a kirtan
was going on. On entering the house he inquired about you and exclaimed, "Where is
he?" He was totally unconscious of his surroundings and practically walked over the
people.' He has no fear of his relatives' threats. Sometimes he spends three nights at a
stretch at Dakshineswar."
MUKHERJI: "Hari became simply speechless at what you said yesterday. He said to me:
'Such wisdom can be found only in the philosophical systems of Samkhya, Yoga, and
Vedānta. He is no ordinary person.'"
MASTER: "But I have never studied Samkhya or Vedānta.
Knowledge of God is the same as love of Him & Divine love leads to union with God.
Perfect Jnāna and perfect bhakti are one and the same thing. A man reasons, saying,
'Not this, not this'; he rejects the unreal. When his reasoning comes to an end, he
attains the Knowledge of Brahman. Then he accepts what he rejected before. A man
carefully climbs to the roof, rejecting the steps one by one. After reaching the roof he
realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof, namely, brick, lime,
and brick-dust.
"He who is aware of the high is also aware of the low. After the attainment of knowledge
one looks alike on high and low.
"While Prahlada dwelt on the plane of the Supreme Reality, he maintained the attitude of
'I am He'; but when he climbed down to the physical plane, he would look on himself as
the servant of God.
"Hanuman also sometimes said, 'I am He', sometimes, 'I am the servant of God',
sometimes, 'I am a part of God.'
"Why should a man cherish love of God in his heart? How else will he live? How else will
he spend his days?
"To be sure, the ego does not disappear altogether. As long as the pot of 'I' persists, one
cannot realize 'I am He.' In samādhi the ego totally disappears; then what is remains.
Ramprasad says: 'O Mother, when I shall attain Knowledge, then You alone will know
whether I am good or You are good.'
"As long as 'I-consciousness' exists, one should have the attitude of a bhakta; one
should not say, 'I am God.' A man aware of his body should feel that he is not Krishna
Himself, but His devotee. But if God draws the devotee to Himself, then it is different. It
is like the master saying to his beloved servant: 'Come, take your seat near me. You are
the same as I.'
"The waves are part of the Ganges, but the Ganges is not part of the waves.
897"Śiva experiences two states of mind. When He is completely absorbed in His own Self,
He feels, 'I am He.' In that union neither body nor mind functions. But when He is
conscious of His separate ego, He dances, exclaiming, 'Rāma! Rāma!'
"That which is unmoving also moves. Just now you are still, but a few moments later the
same you will be engaged in action.
"Jnāna and bhakti are one and the same thing. The difference is like this: one man says
'water', and another, 'a block of ice'.
Two kinds of samādhi
"Generally speaking there are two kinds of samādhi. First, sthita or jada samādhi: one
attains it by following the path of knowledge-as a result of the destruction of the ego
through reasoning. Second, bhava samādhi: one attains this by following the path of
bhakti. In this second samādhi a trace of ego remains, like a line, in order to enable the
devotee to enjoy God, to taste His Lila. But one cannot understand all this if one is
attached to 'woman and gold'.
"I said to Kedār, 'You will never succeed if your mind dwells on "woman and gold".' I
wanted to pass my hand over his chest, but I could not. He has knots and twists inside.
It was like a room smelling of filth, which I could not enter. His attachment to the world
is very deep; it is like a natural emblem of Śiva, whose root spreads as far as Benares.
One will never succeed if one is attached to the world-to 'woman and gold'.
Master praises his young disciples
"The youngsters are yet untouched by 'woman and gold'. That is why I love them so
dearly. Hazra says to me, 'You love a boy if he comes from a wealthy family or if he is
handsome.' If that is so, then why do I love Harish, Lātu, and Narendra? Narendra hasn't
a penny to buy salt to season his rice.
"The youngsters' minds are not yet coloured by worldliness. That is why they are so pure
in heart. Besides, many of them are eternally perfect; they have been drawn to God
from their very birth. It is like a garden in which, while cleaning it, you suddenly discover
water-pipes. The water gushes forth without any effort on your part."
BALARĀM: "Sir, how was it possible for Purna to know all of a sudden that the world is
illusory?"
MASTER: "He has inherited that knowledge from his previous births. In his past lives he
practised many disciplines. It is the body alone that is small or grows big, and not the
Ātman.
"Do you know what these youngsters are like? They are like certain plants that grow fruit
first and then flowers. These devotees first of all have the vision of God; next they hear
about His glories and attributes; and at last they are united with Him. Look at Niranjan.
He always keeps his accounts clear. He will be able to go whenever he hears the call.
898Respect for one's own mother
But one should look after one's mother as long as she is alive. I used to worship my
mother with flowers and sandal-paste. It is the Mother of the Universe who is embodied
as our earthly mother.
"As long as you look after your own body, you must look after your mother too.
Therefore I said to Hazra: 'when you have a cold, you procure black pepper, sugar
candy, and salt. As long as you feel you must look after your body, you must look after
your mother too.'
"But it is quite different when you completely forget your body. Then God Himself
assumes your responsibilities. A minor cannot look after himself; therefore a guardian is
appointed for him. Chaitanyadeva, like a minor, could not look after himself."
M. went to the Ganges to bathe.
Master's spiritual experiences
Sri Ramakrishna was talking with the devotees in the small room in Balarām's house.
Mahendra, Balarām, Tulasi, Haripada, Girish, and other devotees were sitting on the
floor. M. returned from the Ganges. After saluting the Master he took a seat near him.
Sri Ramakrishna was recounting to the devotees some of his spiritual experiences.
MASTER: "One day in the Kāli temple Haladhāri and Nangta were reading the Adhyātma
Rāmāyana. Suddenly I had a vision of a river with woods on both sides. The trees and
plants were green. Rāma and Lakshmana were walking along wearing their shorts. One
day, in front of the kuthi, I saw Arjuna's chariot. Sri Krishna was seated in it as the
charioteer. I still remember it. Another day, while listening to kirtan at Kamarpukur, I
saw Gaurānga in front of me.
"At that time a naked person, emerging from my body, used to go about with me. I used
to joke with him. He looked like a boy and was a paramahamsa. I can't describe to you
all the divine forms I saw at that time. I was suffering then from indigestion, which
would become worse when I saw visions; so I would try to shun these divine forms and
would spit on the ground when I saw them. But they would follow me and obsess me like
ghosts. I was always overwhelmed with divine ecstasy and couldn't tell the passing of
day and night. On the day after such a vision I would have a severe attack of diarrhoea,
and all these ecstasies would pass out through my bowels."
GIRISH (smiling): "I am examining your horoscope."
MASTER (smiling): "I was born on the second day of the bright fortnight of the moon. My
horoscope shows the positions of the sun, the moon, and Mercury at the time of my
birth. There are not many more details."
GIRISH: "You were born under Kumbha. Rāma and Krishna were born under Karkat and
Brisha, and Chaitanya under Simha."
899MASTER: "I had two desires: first, that I should be the king of the devotees, and second,
that I should not be a dry sādhu."
GIRISH (smiling): "Why did you have to practise spiritual discipline?"
MASTER (smiling): "Even the Divine Mother had to practise austere sādhanā to obtain
Śiva as Her husband. She practised the panchatapa. She would also immerse Her body
in water in wintertime, and look fixedly at the sun. Krishna Himself had to practise much
sādhanā . I had many mystic experiences, but I cannot reveal their contents. Under the
bel-tree I had many flaming visions. There I practised the various sadhanas prescribed
in the Tantra. I needed many articles-human skulls, and so forth and so on. The
Brahmani used to collect these things for me. I practised a number of mystic postures.
"I had another strange experience: if I felt egotistic on a particular day, I would be sick
the following day."
M. sat motionless as a picture on canvas, hearing about these unique visions of the
Master. The other devotees also were spellbound. There was a dead silence in the room.
TULASI (pointing to M.): "He never laughs."
MASTER: "But he laughs inside. The surface of the river Phalgu is covered with sand; but
if you dig into the sand, water comes up.
(To M.) "Don't you scrape your tongue? Scrape it every day."
BALARĀM: "Well, Purna has heard much about you from M."
MASTER: "Perhaps the account of my early spiritual experiences."
BALARĀM: "If Purna is perfect by nature, then what is M.'s function?"
MASTER: "A mere instrument."
It was nine o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna was about to leave for Dakshineswar. Arrangements
were being made for his departure. A boat had been hired at Baghbazar. The devotees
saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna went to the boat with one or two devotees. Gopal
Ma accompanied them. She intended to spend the morning at Dakshineswar and go to
Kamarhati in the afternoon. The camp cot generally used by Rākhāl at Dakshineswar had
been sent to Calcutta for repair. It was put in the boat, and the boat left for
Dakshineswar. According to the Hindu almanac the day was not auspicious. So Sri
Ramakrishna decided to return to Balarām's house the next Saturday and start again for
Dakshineswar on an auspicious day.
