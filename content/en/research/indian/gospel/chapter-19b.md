## Four stages of life

There are 4 Stages of Life:

1. brahmacharya
2. garhasthya
3. Vanaprastha
4.  sannyas.

During the first three stages a man has to perform his worldly duties. 

The sannyasi carries only his staff, water-pot, and begging-bowl. He too may perform certain
nityakarma, but his mind is not attached to it; he is not conscious of doing such work.

Some sannyasis perform nityakarma to set an example to the world. If a householder or a man belonging to the other stages of life performs action without attachment, then he
is united with God through such action. 

"In the case of a paramahamsa, like Sukadeva, all karmas-all puja, japa, tarpan, sandhya, and so forth-drop away. In this state a man communes with God through the
mind alone. Sometimes he may be pleased to perform outward activities for the welfare of mankind. But his recollection and contemplation of God remain uninterrupted."
It was about eight o'clock in the evening. 

Sri Ramakrishna asked Mahimacharan to recite a few hymns from the scriptures. Mahima read the first verse of the Uttara Gitā, describing the nature of the Supreme Brahman:
He, Brahman, is one, partless, stainless, and beyond the ether; 


Without beginning or end, unknowable by mind or intelligence.

Finally he came to the seventh verse of the third chapter, which reads:

The twice-born worships the Deity in fire,
The munis contemplate Him in the heart,
Men of limited wisdom see Him in the image,
And the yogis who have attained samesightedness
Behold Him everywhere.

No sooner did the Master hear the words "the yogis who have attained samesightedness" than he stood up and went into samādhi, his arm supported by the splint and bandage.
Speechless, the devotees looked at this yogi who had himself attained the state of samesightedness.

After a long time the Master regained consciousness of the outer world and took his seat. He asked Mahima to recite verses describing the love of God. The latter recited
from the Nārada Pancharatra:

What need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love?

What is the use of penance if God is not worshipped with love?

What need is there of penance if God is seen within and without?

What is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without?

O Brahman! O my child! Cease from practising further penances.

Hasten to Sankara, the Ocean of Heavenly Wisdom;

Obtain from Him the love of God, the pure love praised by devotees, Which snaps in twain the shackles that bind you to the world.

MASTER: "Ah! On hearing these verses the Master was about to go again into an ecstatic mood, but he
restrained himself with effort.

Mahima read from the Yati–Panchaka:

I am She, the Divine Mother, in whom the illusion of the universe of animate and inanimate things is seen, as in magic, and in whom the universe shines, being the play
of Her mind. I am She, the Embodiment of Consciousness, who is the Self of the universe, the only Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss.
When the Master heard the line, "I am She, the Embodiment of Consciousness", he said
with a smile, "Whatever is in the microcosm is also in the macrocosm."
Next Mahima read the Six Stanzas of Nirvāna :

Om. I am neither mind, intelligence, ego, nor chitta,
Neither ears nor tongue nor the senses of smell and sight;
Nor am I ether, earth, fire, water, or air:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
I am neither the prana, nor the five vital breaths,
Neither the seven elements of the body nor its five sheaths,
Nor hands nor feet nor tongue, nor the organs of sex and
voiding:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Neither loathing nor liking have I, neither greed nor delusion;
No sense have I of ego or pride, neither dharma nor moksha;
Neither desire of the mind nor object for its desiring:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Neither right nor wrong doing am I, neither pleasure nor pain,
Nor the mantra, the sacred place, the Vedas, the sacrifice;
Neither the act of eating, the eater, nor the food:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Death or fear I have none, nor any distinction of caste;
Neither father nor mother nor even a birth have I;
Neither friend nor comrade, neither disciple nor guru:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
411I have no form or fancy; the All-pervading am I;
Eyerywhere I exist, yet I am beyond the senses;
Neither salvation am I, nor anything that may be known:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Each time Mahima repeated: "I am Śiva! I am Śiva!", the Master rejoined with a smile:
"Not I! Not I! Thou art Knowledge Absolute."
Mahima read a few more verses and also a description of the six psychic centres of the
body. He said that in Benares he had witnessed the death of a yogi in the state of yoga.
MAHIMA: "There are fine passages in the Rāma Gitā."
MASTER: "You are speaking of the Rāma Gitā. Then you must be a staunch Vedantist.
How many books of that kind the sādhus used to read here!"
Mahima recited the description of Om:
It is like the unceasing flow of oil; like the long peal of a bell.
About the characteristics of samādhi he read: "The man established in samādhi sees the
upper region filled with Ātman, the nether region filled with Ātman, the middle region
filled with Ātman. He sees all filled with Ātman."
Adhar and Mahima saluted the Master and departed.
At noon the following day, after his midday meal, Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the
small couch, when Ram, Surendra, and a few other devotees arrived from Calcutta.
They were worried about the Master's injured arm. The arm was bandaged. M.
was present.
MASTER (to the devotees): "The Mother has put me in such a state of mind that I cannot
hide anything from anyone. Mine is the condition of a child. Rākhāl doesn't understand
it. He covers my injured arm, wrapping my body with a cloth lest others should see my
injury and criticize me. He took Dr. Madhu aside and reported my illness. But I
shouted and said: 'Hello! Where are you, Madhusudan? Come and see. My arm is
broken!'
"I used to sleep in the same room with Mathur and his wife. They took care of me as if I
were their own child. I was then passing through a state of divine madness. Mathur
would ask me, 'Father, do you hear our conversation?' 'Yes', I would reply.
"Once Mathur's wife became suspicious of his movements and said to him, 'If you go
anywhere, he must accompany you.' One day Mathur went to a certain place and asked
me to wait downstairs. He returned after half an hour and said to me: 'Come, father, let
us go now. The carriage is waiting.' When Mathur's wife asked me about it, I reported
the thing correctly. I said to her: 'We went to a certain house. He told me to stay
412downstairs and himself went upstairs. He came down after half an hour and we left the
place.' Of course she understood the thing in her own way.
"A partner of Mathur's estate used to take fruits and vegetables stealthily from the
temple garden. When the other partners asked me about it, I told them the exact
truth."
Sunday, February 24, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room after his midday meal, and Mani Mallick was
sitting on the floor beside him, when M. arrived. M. saluted the Master and sat down
beside Mani. The Master's injured arm was bandaged.
MASTER (to M.): "How did you come?"
M: "I came as far as Alambazar in a carriage and from there I walked."
MANILAL: "Oh, he is so hot!"
MASTER (with a smile): "This makes me think that all these are not mere fancies of my
brain. Otherwise why should these 'Englishmen' take so much trouble to come here?"
Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to them about his health and his injured arm.
Master's childlike impatience
MASTER: "Now and then I become impatient about my arm. I show it to this or that
man and ask him whether I shall get well again. That makes Rākhāl angry. He doesn't
understand my mood. Now and then I say to myself, 'Let him go away.' Again I say to
the Mother: 'Mother, where will he go? Why should he burn himself in the frying-pan of
the world?'
"This childlike impatience of mine is nothing new. I used to ask Mathur Babu to feel my
pulse and tell me whether I was ill.
"Well, where then is my faith in God? Once I was going to Kamarpukur in a bullock-cart,
when several persons came up to the cart with clubs in their hands. They looked like
highwaymen. I began to chant the names of the gods. Sometimes I repeated the
names of Rāma and Durga, and some times 'Om Tat Sat', so that in case one failed
another would work.
(To M.) "Can you tell me why I am so impatient?"
M: "Your mind, sir, is always absorbed in samādhi. You have kept a fraction of it on
your body for the welfare of the devotees. Therefore you feel impatient now and then
for your body's safety."
MASTER: "That is true. A little of the mind is attached to the body. It wants to enjoy
the love of God and the company of the devotees."
413Mani Mallick told the Master about an exhibition that was being held in Calcutta. He
described a beautiful image of Yaśoda with the Baby Krishna on her lap. Sri
Ramakrishna's eyes filled with tears. On hearing about Yaśoda, the embodiment of
maternal love, his spiritual consciousness was kindled and he wept.
MANILAL: "If you were not unwell, you could visit the exhibition in the Maidan."
MASTER (to M. and the others): "I shan't be able to see everything even if I go. Perhaps
my eyes will fall on some certain thing and I shall become unconscious. Then I shall not
be able to see the rest. I was taken to the Zoological Garden. I Went into samādhi at
the sight of the lion, for the carrier of the Mother awakened in my mind the
consciousness of the Mother Herself. In that state who could see the other animals? I
had to return home after seeing only the lion. Hence Jadu Mallick's mother first
suggested that I should go to the exhibition and then said I should not."
Mani Mallick, about sixty-five years old, had been a member of the Brahmo Samaj for
many years, and Sri Ramakrishna gave him instruction that would agree with his mood.
MASTER: "Pundit Jaynarayan had very liberal views. I visited him once and liked his
attitude. But his sons wore high boots. He told me he intended to go to Benares and
live there, and at last he carried out his intention; for later on he did live in Benares and
die there. When one grows old one should retire, like Jaynarayan, and devote oneself to
the thought of God. What do you say?"
MANILAL: "True, sir. I don't relish the worries and troubles of the world."
MASTER: "Gauri used to worship his wife with offerings of flowers. All women are
manifestations of the Divine Mother. (To Manilal) Please tell them that little story of
yours."
MANILAL (smiling): "Once several men were crossing the Ganges in a boat. One of
them, a pundit, was making a great display of his erudition, saying that he had studied
various books-the Vedas, the Vedānta, and the six systems of philosophy. He asked a
fellow passenger, 'Do you know the Vedānta?' 'No, revered sir.' 'The Samkhya and the
Patanjala?' 'No, revered sir.' 'Have you read no philosophy whatsoever?' 'No, revered
sir.' The pundit was talking in this vain way and the passenger sitting in silence, when a
great storm arose and the boat was about to sink. The passenger said to the pundit,
'Sir, can you swim?' 'No', replied the pundit. The passenger said, 'I don't know the
Samkhya or the Patanjala, but I can swim.' "
MASTER (smiling): "What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing
needful is to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else
illusory.
"While Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the bird, Drona asked him: 'What do
you see? Do you see these kings?' 'No, sir', replied Arjuna. 'Do you 'See me'?' 'No.' 'The
414tree?' 'No.' 'The bird on the tree?' 'No.' 'What do you see then?' 'Only the eye of the
bird.'
"He who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark. He alone is clever who sees that
God is real and all else is illusory. What need have I of other information? Hanuman
once remarked: 'I don't know anything about the phase of the moon or the position of
the stars. I only contemplate Rāma.'
(To M.) "Please buy a few fans for our use here.
(To Manilal) "Look here, pay a visit to his [meaning M.'s] father. The sight of a devotee
will inspire you.
God's manifestation as man
(To M.) "Since my arm was injured a deep change has come over me. I now delight only
in the Naralila, the human manifestation of God. Nitya and Lila. The Nitya is the
Indivisible Satchidananda, and the Lila, or Sport, takes various forms, such as the Lila as
God, the Lila as the deities, the Lila as man, and the Lila as the universe.
"Vaishnavcharan. used to say that one has attained Perfect Knowledge if one believes in
God sporting as man. I wouldn't adopt it then. But now I realize that he was right.
Vaishnavcharan liked pictures of man expressing tenderness and love.
(To Manilal) "It is God Himself who is sporting in the form of man. It is He alone, who
has become Mani Mallick. The Sikhs teach: 'Thou art Satchidananda.'
"Now and then man catches a glimpse of his real Self and becomes speechless with
wonder. At such times he swims in an ocean of joy. It is like suddenly meeting a dear
relative. (To M.) The other day as I was coming here in a carriage, I felt like that at the
sight of Baburam. When Śiva realizes His own Self, He dances about in joy exclaiming,
'What am I! What am I!'
"The same thing has been described in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana. Nārada said, 'O Rāma,
all men are Thy forms, and it is Sita who has become all women.' On looking at the
actors in the Ramlila, I felt that Narayana Himself had taken these human forms. The
genuine and the imitation appeared to be the same.
"Why do people worship virgins? All women are so many forms of the Divine Mother.
But Her manifestation is greatest in pure-souled virgins.
(To M.) "Why do I become impatient when I am ill? Because the Mother has placed me in
the state of a child. The child depends entirely on its mother. The child of the
maidservant, when he quarrels with the child of the master, says, 'I shall tell my
mother.'
"I was taken to Radhabazar to be photographed. It had been arranged that I should go
to Rajendra Mitra's house that day. I heard that Keshab would be there. I planned to
415tell them certain things, but I forgot it all when I went to Radhabazar. I said: 'O Mother,
Thou wilt speak. What shall I say?'
"I have not the nature of a Jnāni. He considers himself great. He says, 'What? How can
I be ill?'
"Koar Singh once said to me, 'You still worry about your body.' But it is my nature to
believe that my Mother knows everything. It was She who would speak at Rajendra
Mitra's house. Hers are the only effective words. One ray of light from the Goddess of
Wisdom stuns a thousand scholars.
"The Mother has kept me in the state of a bhakta, a vijnāni. That is why I joke with
Rākhāl and the others. Had I been in the condition of a Jnāni I couldn't do that.
"In this state I realize that it is the Mother alone who has become everything. I see Her
everywhere. In the Kāli temple I found that the Mother Herself had become everything-
even the wicked, even the brother of Bhagavat Pundit.
"Once I was about to scold Ramlal's mother, but I had to restrain myself. I saw her to
be a form of the Divine Mother. I worship virgins because I see in them the Divine
Mother. My wife strokes my feet, but I salute her afterwards.
"You salute me by touching my feet. But had Hriday been here, who would have dared
to touch them? He wouldn't have allowed anyone to do it. I have to return your salutes
because the Mother has placed me in a state in which I see God in everything.
"You see, one cannot exclude even a wicked person. A tulsi-leaf, however dry or small,
can be used for worship in the temple."
