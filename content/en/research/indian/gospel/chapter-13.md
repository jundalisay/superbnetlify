August 19, 1883

IT WAS SUNDAY, the first day after the full moon. Sri Ramakrishna was resting after his
noon meal. The midday offering had been made in the temples, and the temple doors
were closed.

In the early afternoon the Master sat up on the small couch in his room. M. prostrated
himself before him and sat on the floor. The Master was talking to him on the
philosophy of Vedānta.

## Householders and Non-dualism

MASTER (to M.): "Self-Knowledge is discussed in the Ashtāvakra Samhitā. The non-
dualists say, 'Soham', that is, 'I am the Supreme Self.' This is the view of the sannyasis
of the Vedantic school. But this is not the right attitude for householders, who are
conscious of doing everything themselves. That being so, how can they declare, 'I am

That, the actionless Supreme Self'? According to the non-dualists the Self is unattached.
Good and bad, virtue and vice, and the other pairs of opposites, cannot in any way injure
the Self, though they undoubtedly afflict those who have identified themselves with their
bodies. Smoke soils the wall, certainly, but it cannot in any way affect Ākāśa, space.
Following the Vedantists of this class, Krishnakishore used to say, 'I am Kha', meaning
Ākāśa. Being a great devotee, he could say that with some justification; but it is not
becoming for others to do so.

"But to feel that one is a free soul is very good. By constantly repeating, 'I am free, I
am free', a man verily becomes free. On the other hand, by constantly repeating, 'I am
bound, I am bound', he certainly becomes bound to worldliness. The fool who says only,
'I am a sinner, I am a sinner', verily drowns himself in worldliness. One should rather
say: I have chanted the name of God. How can I be a sinner? How can I be bound?'
(To M.) "You see, I am very much depressed today. Hriday has written me that he is
very ill. Why should I feel dejected about it? Is it because of maya or daya?"
M. could not find suitable words for a reply, and remained silent.
Maya and compassion
MASTER: "Do you know what maya is? It is attachment to relatives-parents, brother and
sister, wife and children, nephew and niece. Daya means love for all created beings.
Now what is this, my feeling about Hriday? Is it maya or daya? But Hriday did so much
for me: he served me whole-heartedly and nursed me when I was ill. But later he
tormented me also. The torment became so unbearable that once I was about to
commit suicide by jumping into the Ganges from the top of the embankment. But he did
303much to serve me. Now my mind will be at rest if he gets some money. But whom shall
I ask for it? Who likes to speak about such things to our rich visitors?"
At two or three o'clock in the afternoon Adhar Sen and Balarām arrived. After saluting
Sri Ramakrishna, they sat on the floor and asked him if he was well. The Master said,
"Yes, I am well physically, but a little troubled in mind." He did not refer to Hriday and
his troubles.
The conversation turned to the Goddess Simhavahini.
MASTER: "Yes, I visited the Goddess. She is worshipped by one of the branches of the
Mallick family of Calcutta. This branch of the family is now in straitened circumstances,
and the house they live in is dilapidated. The walls and floor are spotted with moss and
pigeon-droppings, and the cement and plaster are crumbling. But other branches of the
Mallick family are well off. This branch has no signs of prosperity. (To M.) Well, what
does that signify?"


## M. remained silent.

MASTER: "The thing is that everyone must reap the result of his past-karma. One must
admit the influence of tendencies inherited from past births and the result of the
prarabdha karma. Nevertheless, in that dilapidated house I saw the face of the Goddess
radiating a divine light. One must believe in the Divine Presence in the image.
"Once I went to Vishnupur. The raja of that place has several fine temples. In one of
them there is an image of the Divine Mother, called Mrinmayi. There are several lakes
near the temple, known as the Lalbandh, Krishnabandh, and so on. In the water of one
of the lakes I could smell the ointments that women use for their hair. How do you
explain that? I didn't know at that time that the woman devotees offer ointments to the
Goddess Mrinmayi while visiting Her temple. Near the lake I went into samādhi, though
I had not yet seen the image in the temple. In that state I saw the divine form from the
waist up, rising from the water."
In the mean time other devotees had arrived. Someone referred to the political
revolution and civil war in Kabul. A devotee said that Yakub Khan, the Amir of
Afghanistan, had been deposed. He told the Master that the Amir was a great devotee
of God.

Pleasure and pain are characteristics of physical life

MASTER: "But you must remember that pleasure and pain are the characteristics of the
embodied state. In Kavi Kankan's Chandi it is written that Kaluvir was sent to prison
and a heavy stone placed on his chest. Yet Kalu was born as a result of a boon from the
Divine Mother of the Universe. Thus pleasure and pain are inevitable when the soul
accepts a body. Again, take the case of Srimanta, who was a great devotee. Though his
mother, Khullana, was very much devoted to the Divine Mother, there was no end to his
troubles. He was almost beheaded. There is also the instance of the wood-cutter who
was a great lover of the Divine Mother. She appeared before him and showed him much
grace and love; but he had to continue his profession of wood-cutting and earn his
304livelihood by that arduous work. Again, while Devaki, Krishna's mother, was in prison,
she had a vision of God Himself endowed with four hands, holding mace, discus, conch-
shell, and lotus. But with all that she couldn't get out of prison."
M: "Why speak only of getting out of prison? This body is the source of all our troubles.
Devaki should have been freed from the body."
Law of karma
MASTER: "The truth is that one must reap the result of the prarabdha karma. The body
remains as long as the results of past actions do not completely wear away. Once a
blind man bathed in the Ganges and as a result was freed from his sins. But his
blindness remained all the same. (All laugh.) It was because of his evil deeds in his past
birth that he had to undergo that affliction."
M: "Yes,sir. The arrow that has already left the bow is beyond our control."
MASTER: "However much a bhakta may experience physical joy and sorrow, he always
has knowledge and the treasure of divine love. This treasure never leaves him. Take
the Pandava brothers for instance. Though they suffered so many calamities, they did
not lose their God-Consciousness even once. Where can you find men like them,
endowed with so much knowledge and devotion?"
Just then Narendra and Colonel Viswanath Upadhyaya entered the room. Narendra was
then twenty-two years old and studying in college. They saluted the Master and sat
down. The Master requested Narendra to sing. The Tānpura hung on the west wall of
the room. The devotees fixed their eyes on Narendra as he began to tune the drums.
MASTER (to Narendra):
"The drums don't sound as well as before."
CAPTAIN: "They are now full. Therefore they are quiet, like a vessel filled with water.
Or they are like a holy man, who remains silent when his heart is full of God-
Consciousness."
MASTER: "But what about sages like Nārada?"
CAPTAIN: "They talked because they were moved by the sufferings of others."
MASTER: "You are right. After attaining samādhi, Nārada, Sukadeva, and others came
down a few steps, as it were, to the plane of normal consciousness and broke their
silence out of compassion for the sufferings of others and to help them."
Narendra began to sing:
Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness
When He who is all Good, all Beauty, and all Truth,
Will light the inmost shrine of my heart?
305When shall I sink at last, ever beholding Him,
Into that Ocean of Delight? . . .
No sooner had the Master heard a few words of the song than he went into
samādhi. He sat with folded hands, facing the east. His body was erect and his
completely bereft of worldly consciousness. His breath had almost stopped.
unwinking eyes he sat motionless as a picture on a canvas. His mind had dived
into the Ocean of God's Beauty.

Narendra left the room and went to the east verandah, where Hazra was seated on a
blanket, with a rosary in his hand. They fell to talking. Other devotees arrived. The
Master came down from samādhi and looked around. He could not find Narendra. The
Tānpura was lying on the floor. He noticed that the earnest eyes of the devotees were
riveted on him.
MASTER (referring to Narendra): "He has lighted the fire.
whether he stays in the room or goes out.
Now it doesn't matter
Joy of God-Consciousness
(To Captain and the other devotees) "Attribute to yourselves the bliss of God-
Consciousness; then you too will experience ineffable joy. The bliss of God-
Consciousness always exists in you. It is only hidden by the veiling and projecting
power of maya. The less you are attached to the world, the more you love God."
CAPTAIN: "The farther you proceed toward your home in Calcutta, the farther you leave
Benares behind. Again, the farther you proceed toward Benares, the farther behind you
leave your home."
MASTER: "As Radha advanced toward Krishna, she could smell more and more of the
sweet fragrance of His body. The nearer you approach to God, the more you feel His
love. As the river approaches the ocean it increasingly feels the flow of the tides.
Ideals of Jnāni and bhakta
"The Jnāni experiences God-Consciousness within himself; it is like the upper Ganges,
flowing in only one direction. To him the whole universe is illusory, like a dream; he is
always established in the Reality of Self. But with the lover of God the case is different.
His feeling does not flow in only one direction. He feels both the ebb-tide and the flood-
tide of divine emotion. He laughs and weeps and dances and sings in the ecstasy of
God. The lover of God likes to sport with Him. In the Ocean of God-Consciousness he
sometimes swims, sometimes goes down, and sometimes rises to the surface-like pieces
of ice in the water. (Laughter.)
306Brahman and Śakti are not different
"The Jnāni seeks to realize Brahman. But the ideal of the bhakta is the Personal God-a
God endowed with omnipotence and with the six treasures. Yet Brahman and Śakti are,
in fact, not different. That which is the Blissful Mother is, again, Existence-Knowledge-
Bliss Absolute. They are like the gem and its lustre. When one speaks of the lustre of
the gem, one thinks of the gem; and again, when one speaks of the gem, one refers to
its lustre. One cannot conceive of the lustre of the gem without thinking of the gem, and
one cannot conceive of the gem without thinking of its lustre.
"Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute is one, and one only. But It is associated with
different limiting adjuncts on account of the different degrees of Its manifestation. That
is why one finds various forms of God. The devotee sings, 'O my Divine Mother, Thou
art all these!' Wherever you see actions, like creation, preservation, and dissolution,
there is the manifestation of Śakti. Water is water whether it is calm or full of waves
and bubbles. The Absolute alone is the Primordial Energy, which creates, preserves, and
destroys. Thus it is the same 'Captain', whether he remains inactive or performs his
worship or pays a visit to the Governor General. Only we designate him by different
names at different times."
CAPTAIN: "Yes, sir, that is so."
MASTER: "I said those words to Keshab Sen."
CAPTAIN: "Keshab is not an orthodox Hindu. He adopts manners and customs according
to his own whim. He is a well-to-do gentleman and not a holy man."
MASTER (to the other devotees): "Captain forbids me to go to see Keshab."
CAPTAIN: "But, sir, you act as you will. What can I do?"
MASTER (sharply): "Why shouldn't I go to see Keshab? You feel at ease when you go to
the Governor General's house, and for money at that. Keshab thinks of God and chants
His name. Isn't it you who are always saying that God Himself has become the universe
and all its living beings? Doesn't God dwell in Keshab also?"
With these words the Master left the room abruptly and went to the northeast verandah.
Captain and the other devotees remained, waiting for his return. M. accompanied the
Master to the verandah, where Narendra was talking with Hazra. Sri Ramakrishna knew
that Hazra always indulged in dry philosophical discussions. Hazra would say: "The
world is unreal, like a dream. Worship, food offerings to the Deity, and so forth, are only
hallucinations of the mind. The aim of spiritual life is to meditate on one's own real
Self." Then he would repeat, "I am He." But, with all that, he had a soft corner in his
heart for money, material things, and people's attention.
Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to Hazra and Narendra, "Hello! What are you talking
about?"
307NARENDRA (smiling): "Oh, we are discussing a great many things. They are rather too
deep for others."
MASTER (with a smile): "But Pure Knowledge and Pure Love are one and the same
thing. Both lead the aspirants to the same goal. The path of love is much the easier."
Narendra quoted a song:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason?
Narendra said to M. that he had been reading a book by Hamilton, who wrote: "A
learned ignorance is the end of philosophy and the beginning of religion."
MASTER (to M.): "What does that mean?"
Narendra explained the sentence in Bengali. The Master beamed with joy and said in
English, "Thank you! Thank you!" Everyone laughed at the charming way he said these
words. They knew that his English vocabulary consisted of only half a dozen words.
It was almost dusk when most of the devotees, including Narendra, took leave of the
Master. Sri Ramakrishna went out and looked at the Ganges for a few minutes from the
west porch. Two priests were bathing in preparation for the evening worship. Young
men of the village were strolling in the garden or standing on the concrete embankment,
gazing at the murmuring river. Others, perhaps more thoughtful, were walking about in
the solitude of the Panchavati.
It became dark. The maidservant lighted the lamp in Sri Ramakrishna's room and burnt
incense. The evening worship began in the twelve temples of Śiva and in the shrines of
Krishna and Kāli.
As it was the first day after the full moon, the moonlight soon flooded the tops of the
trees and temples, and touched with silver the numberless waves of the sacred river.
The Master returned to his room. After bowing to the Divine Mother, he clapped his
hands and chanted the sweet names of God. A number of holy pictures hung on the
walls of the room. Among others, there were pictures of Dhruva, Prahlada, Kāli, Radha-
Krishna, and the coronation of Rāma. The Master bowed low before the pictures and
repeated the holy names. Then he repeated the holy words, "Brahma-Ātmā-Bhagavan;
Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan; Brahma-Śakti, Śakti-Brahma; Veda, Purana, Tantra, Gitā,
Gayatri." Then he said: "I have taken refuge at Thy feet, O Divine Mother; not I, but
Thou. I am the machine and Thou art the Operator", and so on.
Master extols Narendra
While the Master was meditating in this fashion on the Divine Mother, a few devotees,
coming in from the garden, gathered in his room. Sri Ramakrishna sat down on the
308small couch. He said to the devotees: "Narendra, Bhavanath, Rākhāl , and devotees like
them belong to the group of the nityasiddhas; they are eternally free. Religious practice
on their part is superfluous. Look at Narendra. He doesn't care about anyone. One day
he was going with me in Captain's carriage. Captain wanted him to take a good seat,
but Narendra didn't even look at him. He is independent even of me. He doesn't tell me
all he knows, lest I should praise his scholarship before others. He is free from
ignorance and delusion. He has no bonds. He is a great soul. He has many good
qualities. He is expert in music, both as a singer and player, and is also a versatile
scholar. Again, he keeps his passions under control and says that he will never marry.
There is a close friendship between Narendra and Bhavanath; they are just like man and
woman. Narendra doesn't come here very often. That is good, for I am overwhelmed
by his presence."
Monday, August 20, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed, inside the mosquito net, meditating. It was
about eight o'clock in the evening. M. was sitting on the floor with his friend Hari Babu.
Hari, a young man of twenty-eight, had lost his wife about eleven years before and had
not married a second time. He was much, devoted to his parents, brothers, and sisters.
Hazra was living at Dakshineswar. Rākhāl lived with the Master, though now and then
he stayed at Adhar's house. Narendra, Bhavanath, Adhar, M., Ram, Manomohan, and
other devotees visited the Master almost every week.
Hriday, Sri Ramakrishna's nephew, was ill in his home in the country. The Master was
worried about him. One of the devotees had sent him a little money, but the Master did
not know it.
When Sri Ramakrishna came out of the mosquito net and sat on the small couch, the
devotees saluted him.
MASTER (to M.): "I was meditating inside the net. It occurred to me that meditation,
after all, was nothing but the imagining of a form, and so I did not enjoy it. One gets
satisfaction if God reveals Himself in a flash. Again, I said to myself, 'Who is it that
meditates, and on whom does he meditate?' "
M: "Yes, sir. You said that God Himself has become everything-the universe and all
living beings. Even he who meditates is God."
MASTER: "What is more, one cannot meditate unless God wills it. One can meditate
when God makes it possible for one to do so. What do you say?"
M: "True, sir. You feel like that because there is no 'I' in you. When there is no ego,
one feels like that."
MASTER: "But it is good .to have a trace of ego, which makes it possible for a man to
feel that he is the servant of God. As long as a man thinks that it is he who is doing his
309duties, it is very good for him to feel that God is the Master and he God's servant. When
one is conscious of doing work, one should establish with God the relationship of servant
and Master."
M. was always reflecting on the nature of the Supreme Brahman.
Nature of Brahman
MASTER (to M.): "Like the Ākāśa, Brahman is without any modification. It has become
manifold because of Śakti. Again, Brahman is like fire, which itself has no colour. The
fire appears white if you throw a white substance into it, red if you throw a red, black if
you throw a black. The three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas-belong to Śakti alone.
Brahman Itself is beyond the three gunas. What Brahman is cannot be described. It is
beyond words. That which remains after everything is eliminated by the Vedantic
process of 'Not this, not this', and which is of the nature of Bliss, is Brahman.
"Suppose the husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law's house and is
seated in the drawing-room with other young men of his age. The girl and her friends
are looking at them through the window. Her friends do not know her husband and ask
her, pointing to one young man, 'Is that your husband?' 'No', she answers, smiling.
They point to another young man and ask if he is her husband. Again she answers no.
They repeat the question, referring to a third, and she gives the same answer. At last
they point to her husband and ask, 'Is he the one?' She says neither yes nor no, but only
smiles and keeps quiet. Her friends realize that he is her husband.
"One becomes silent on realizing the true nature of Brahman.
(To M.) "Well, why do I talk so much?"
M: "You talk in order to awaken the spiritual consciousness of the devotees. You once
said that when an uncooked luchi is dropped into boiling ghee it makes a sizzling noise."
The Master began to talk to M. about Hazra.
MASTER: "Do you know the nature of a good man? He never troubles others. He doesn't
harass people. The nature of some people is such that when they go to a feast they
want special seats. A man who has true devotion to God never makes a false step,
never gives others trouble for nothing.
"It is not good to live in the company of bad people. A man should stay away from them
and thus protect himself. (To M.) Isn't that so?"
M: "Yes, sir. The mind sinks far down in the company of the wicked. But it is quite
different with a hero, as you say."
MASTER: "How is that?"
310M: "When a fire is feeble it goes out when even a small stick is thrown into it; but a
blazing fire is not affected even if a plantain-tree is thrown into it. The tree itself is
burnt to ashes."
The Master asked M. about his friend Hari Babu.
M: "He has come here to pay you his respects. He lost his wife long ago."
MASTER (to Hari): "What kind of work do you do?"
M: "Nothing in particular. But at home he takes good care of his parents and his
brothers and sisters."
MASTER (with a smile): "How is that? You are like 'Elder, the pumpkin-cutter'. You are
neither a man of the world nor a devotee of God. That is not good. You must have seen
the sort of elderly man who lives in a family and is always ready, day or night, to
entertain the children. He sits in the parlour and smokes the hubble-bubble. With
nothing in particular to do, he leads a lazy life. Now and again he goes to the inner
court and cuts a pumpkin; for, since women do not cut pumpkins, they send the children
to ask him to come and do it. That is the extent of his usefulness-hence his nickname,
'Elder, the pumpkin-cutter'.
"You must do 'this' as well as 'that'. Do your duties in the world, and also fix your mind
on the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Read books of devotion like the Bhagavata or the life of
Chaitanya when you are alone and have nothing else to do."
It was about ten o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna finished a light supper of farina pudding and
one or two luchis. After saluting him, M. and his friend took their leave.
Friday, September 7, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking in the Master's room at half past seven in the
evening. No one else was present.
MASTER: "The other day I went to Calcutta. As I drove along the streets in the carriage,
I observed that everyone's attention was fixed on low things. Everyone was brooding
over his stomach and running after nothing but food. Everyone's mind was turned to
'woman and gold'. I saw only one or two with their attention fixed on higher things, with
their minds turned to God."
M: "The present age has aggravated this stomach-worry. Trying to imitate the English,
people have turned their attention to more luxuries; therefore their wants have also
increased."
MASTER: "What do the English think about God?"
M: "They believe in a formless God."
311MASTER: "That is also one of our beliefs."
Master's deep spiritual experiences
For a time Master and disciple remained silent. Then Sri Ramakrishna began to describe
his experiences of Brahman.
MASTER: "One day I had the vision of Consciousness, non-dual and indivisible. At first it
had been revealed to me that there were innumerable men, animals, and other
creatures. Among them there were aristocrats, the English, the Muslims, myself,
scavengers, dogs, and also a bearded Mussalman with an earthenware tray of rice in his
hand. He put a few grains of rice into everybody's mouth. I too tasted a little.
"Another day I saw rice, vegetables, and other food-stuff, and filth and dirt as well, lying
around. Suddenly the soul came out of my body and, like a flame, touched everything.
It was like a protruding tongue of fire and tasted everything once, even the excreta. It
was revealed to me that all these are one Substance, the non-dual and indivisible
Consciousness.
"Another day it was revealed to me that I had devotees-my intimate companions, my
very own. Thereafter I would climb to the roof of the kuthi as soon as the bells and the
conch-shells of the evening service sounded in the temples, and cry out with a longing
heart: 'Oh, where are you all? Come here! I am dying to see you!'
(To M.) "Well, what do you think of these visions?"
M: "God sports through you. This I have realized, that you are the instrument and God
is the Master. God has created other beings as if with a machine, but yourself with His
own hands."
MASTER: "Well, Hazra says that after the vision of God one acquires the six divine
powers."
M: "Those who seek pure love don't want powers."
MASTER: "Perhaps Hazra was a poor man in his previous life, and that is why he wants
so much to see the manifestation of power. He wants to know what I talk about with the
cook. He says to me: 'You don't have to talk to the cook. I shall talk to the manager of
the temple myself and see that you get everything you want.' (M. laughs aloud.) He
talks to me that way and I say nothing."
M: "Many a time you have said that a devotee, who loves God for the sake of love does
not care to see God's powers. A true devotee wants to see God as Gopala. In the
beginning God becomes the magnet, and the devotee the needle. But in the end the
devotee himself becomes the magnet, and God the needle; that is to say, God becomes
small to His devotee."
312MASTER: "Yes, it is just like the sun at dawn. You can easily look at that sun. It doesn't
dazzle the eyes; rather it satisfies them. God becomes tender for the sake of His
devotees. He appears before them, setting aside His powers."
Both remained silent for some time.
M: "Why should your visions not be real? If they are unreal, then the world is still more
unreal; for there is only one mind that is the instrument of perception. Your pure mind
sees those visions, and our ordinary minds see worldly objects."
MASTER: "I see that you have grasped the idea of unreality. Well, tell me what you
think of Hazra."
M: "Oh, I don't know." (The Master laughs.)
MASTER: "Well, do you find me to be like anybody else?"
M: "No, sir."
MASTER: "Like any other paramahamsa?"
M: "No, sir. You can't be compared to anybody else."
MASTER (smiling): "Have you heard of a tree called the 'achina'?"
M: "No, sir."
MASTER: "There is a tree called by that name. But nobody knows what it is."
M: "Likewise, it is not possible to recognize you. The more a man understands you, the
more uplifted he will be."
M. was silent. He said to himself: "The Master referred to 'the sun at dawn' and 'the tree
unrecognizable by man'. Did he mean an Incarnation of God? Is this the play of God
through man? Is the Master himself an Incarnation? Was this why he cried to the
devotees from the roof of the kuthi: 'Where are you? Come to me!'?"
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the southeast verandah of the Kāli temple.
Rākhāl, M., and Hazra were with him. He talked light-heartedly about his boyhood days.
When it was dusk he returned to his room and sat down on the small couch. Soon he
went into samādhi and in that state began to talk to the Divine Mother. He said:
"Mother, what is all this row about? Shall I go there? I shall go if You take me." The
Master was to go to a devotee's house. Was it for this that he was asking the Divine
Mother's permission?
Again he spoke to Her, perhaps praying about an intimate disciple:
313"Mother, please make him stainless. Well, Mother, why have You given him only a
particle?" Remaining silent a moment, he said: "Oh, I see. That will be enough for Your
work."
Nature of the Divine Incarnation
In the same state he said, addressing the devotees: "That which is Brahman is verily
Śakti. I address That, again, as the Mother. I call It Brahman when It is inactive, and
Śakti when It creates, preserves, and destroys. It is like water, sometimes still and
sometimes covered with waves. The Incarnation of God is a part of the lila of Śakti. The
purpose of the Divine Incarnation is to teach man ecstatic love for God. The Incarnation
is like the udder of the cow, the only place milk is to be got. God incarnates Himself as
man. There is a great accumulation of divinity in an Incarnation, like the accumulation
of fish in a deep hollow in a lake."
Some of the devotees wondered, "Is Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of God, like
Krishna, Chaitanya, and Christ?"
Sunday, September 9, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna had finished his midday meal and was sitting on the small couch.
Rākhāl , M., and Ratan were sitting on the floor. Ratan was the steward of Jadu Mallick's
garden house and was devoted to the Master. Now and then Ram Chatterji and Hazra
passed in or out of the room. It was about two o'clock.
Ratan told the Master that a yatra performance by Nilkantha had been arranged in Jadu
Mallick's house in Calcutta.
RATAN (to the Master): "You must go. The date has been set."
MASTER: "That's good, I want to go. Nilkantha sings with great devotion."
A DEVOTEE: "That is true, sir."
MASTER: "Tears flow from his eyes as he sings. (To Ratan) I am thinking of spending
the night in Calcutta when I go to see the yatra."
RATAN: "That will be fine."
Ram Chatterji and the other devotees asked Ratan about a theft in Jadu Mallick's house.
RATAN: "Yes, the golden sandals of the Deity were stolen from the shrine room in Jadu
Babu's house. It has created an uproar. They are going to try to discover the thief by
means of a 'charmed plate'. Everybody will sit in one room, and the plate will move in
the direction of the man who stole the sandals."
MASTER (with a smile): "How does the plate move? By itself?"
RATAN: "No. A man presses it to the ground."
314A DEVOTEE: "It is a kind of sleight of hand. It is a clever trick."
MASTER: "The real cleverness is the cleverness by which one realizes God. That trick is
the best of all tricks."
As the conversation went on, several Bengali gentlemen entered the room and, after
saluting the Master, sat down. One of them was already known to Sri Ramakrishna.
These gentlemen followed the cult of Tantra. The Master knew that one of them
indulged in immoral acts in the name of religion. The Tantra rituals, under certain
conditions, allow the mixing of men and women devotees. But Sri Ramakrishna
regarded all women, even prostitutes, as manifestations of the Divine Mother. He
addressed them all as "Mother".
MASTER (with a smile): "Where is Achalananda? My ideal is different from that of
Achalananda and his disciples. As for myself, I look on all women as my mother."
The visiting gentlemen sat silent.
Master's attitude toward women
MASTER: "Every woman is a mother to me. Achalananda used to stay here now and
then. He would drink a great deal of consecrated wine. Hearing about my attitude
toward women, he stubbornly justified his own views. He insisted again and again: 'Why
should you not recognize the attitude of a "hero" toward women? Won't you admit the
injunctions of Śiva? Śiva Himself is the author of the Tantra, which prescribes various
disciplines, including the "heroic".' I said to him: 'But, my dear sir, I don't know. I don't
like these ideas. To me every woman is a mother.'
"Achalananda did not support his own children. He said to me, 'God will support them.' I
said nothing. But this is the way I felt about it: 'Who will support your children? I hope
your renunciation of wife and children is not a way of earning money. People will think
you are a holy man because you have renounced everything: so they will give you
money. In that way you will earn plenty of money.'
"Spiritual practice with a view to winning a lawsuit and earning money, or to helping
others win in court and acquire property, shows a very mean understanding.
Good use of money
"Money enables a man to get food and drink, build a house, worship the Deity, serve
devotees and holy men, and help the poor when he happens to meet them. These are
the good uses of money. Money is not meant for luxuries or creature comforts or for
buying a position in society.
"People practise various Tantrik disciplines to acquire supernatural powers. How mean
such people are! Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, by acquiring one of the eight siddhis
you may add a little to your power, but you will not be able to realize Me.' One cannot
get rid of maya as long as one exercises supernatural powers. And maya begets
egotism.
315"Body and wealth are impermanent. Why go to so much trouble for their sakes? Just
think of the plight of the hathayogis. Their attention is fixed on one ideal only-
longevity. They do not aim at the realization of God at all. They practise such exercises
as washing out the intestines, drinking milk through a tube, and the like, with that one
aim in view.
"There was once a goldsmith whose tongue suddenly turned up and stuck to his palate.
He looked like a man in samādhi. He became completely inert and remained so a long
time. People came to worship him. After several years, his tongue suddenly returned to
its natural position, and he became conscious of things as before. So he went back to
his work as a goldsmith.(All laugh.)
"These are physical things and have nothing to do with God. There was a man who
knew eighty-two postures and talked big about yoga-samādhi. But inwardly he was
drawn to 'woman and gold'. Once he found a bank-note worth several thousand rupees.
He could not resist the temptation, and swallowed it, thinking he would get it out
somehow later on. The note was got out of him all right, but he was sent to jail for
three years. In my guilelessness I used to think that the man had made great spiritual
progress. Really, I say it upon my word!
Master's renunciation of money
"Mahendra Pal of Sinthi once gave Ramlal five rupees. Ramlal told me about it after he
had gone. I asked him what the gift was for, and Ramlal said that it was meant for me.
I thought it might enable me to payoff some of my debt for milk. That night I went to
bed and, if you will believe me, I suddenly woke up with a pain. I felt as if a cat were
scratching inside my chest. I at once went to Ramlal and asked him: 'For whom did
Mahendra give this money? Was it for your aunt?'7 'No,' said Ramlal, 'it is meant for
you.' I said to him, 'Go and return the money at once, or I shall have no peace of mind.'
Ramlal returned the money early in the morning and I felt relieved.
"Once a rich man came here and said to me: 'Sir, you must do something so that I may
win my lawsuit. I have heard of your reputation and so I have come here.' 'My dear sir,'
I said to him, 'you have made a mistake. I am not the person you are looking for;
Achalananda is your man.'
"A true devotee of God does not care for such things as wealth or health. He thinks:
'Why should I practise spiritual austerities for creature comforts, money, or name and
fame? These are all impermanent. They last only a day or two.' "
The visiting gentlemen took leave of the Master after saluting him. When they had
departed, Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to M., "You can never make a thief listen to
religion. (All laugh.)
"Well, what do you think of Narendra?"
M: "He is splendid."
316MASTER: "Yes. His intelligence is as great as his learning. Besides, he is gifted in
music, both as a singer and player. Then too, he has control over his passions. He says
he will never marry."
M: "You once said that one who constantly talks of his sin really becomes a sinner; he
cannot extricate himself from sin. But if a man has firm faith that he is the son of God,
then he makes rapid strides in spiritual life."
MASTER: "Yes, faith. What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say: 'I
have spoken the name of God once. That is enough. How can I remain a sinner? I have
become pure and stainless.' One day Haladhāri said: 'Even Ajamila had to perform
austerities to gratify God. Can one receive the grace of God without austerities? What
will one gain by speaking the name of Narayana only once?' At these remarks
Krishnakishore's anger knew no bounds. The next time he came to this garden to pick
flowers he wouldn't even look at Haladhāri.
"Haladhāri's father was a great devotee. At bathing-time he would stand waist-deep in
the water and meditate on God, uttering the sacred mantra; then the tears would flow
from his eyes.
Krishnakishore's faith in God
"One day a holy man came to the bathing-place on the Ganges at Ariadaha. We talked
about seeing him. Haladhāri said, 'What shall we gain by seeing the body of a man, a
mere cage made of the five elements?' Krishnakishore heard about it and said: 'What?
Did Haladhāri ask what would be gained by visiting a holy man? By repeating the name
of Krishna or Rāma a man transforms his physical body into a spiritual body. To such a
man everything is the embodiment of Spirit. To him Krishna is the embodiment of
Spirit, and His sacred Abode is the embodiment of Spirit.' He also said, 'A man who
utters the name of Krishna or Rāma even once reaps the result of a hundred sandhyas.'
"One of his sons chanted the name of Rāma on his death-bed. Krishnakishore said, 'He
has nothing to worry about; he has chanted the name of Rāma.' But now and then he
wept. After all, it was the death of his own son.
Nothing whatsoever is achieved by the performance of worship, japa, and devotions,
without faith. Isn't that so?"
M: "Yes, sir. That is true."
MASTER: "I see people coming to the Ganges to bathe. They talk their heads off about
everything under the sun. The widowed aunt says: 'Without me they cannot perform the
Durga Puja. I have to look after even the smallest detail. Again, I have to supervise
everything when there is a marriage festiva1 in the family, even the bed of the bride and
groom.'"
M: "Why should we blame them? How else will they pass the time?"
317MASTER (with a smile): "Some people have their shrine rooms in their attics. The
women arrange the offerings and flowers and make the sandal-paste. But, while doing
so, they never say a word about God. The burden of the conversation is: 'What shall we
cook today? I couldn't get good vegetables in the market. That curry was delicious
yesterday. That boy is my cousin. Hello there! Have you that job still? Don't ask me
how I am. My Hari is no more.' Just fancy! They talk of such things in the shrine room
at the time of worship!"
M: "Yes, sir, it is so in the majority of cases. As you say, can one who has passionate
yearning for God continue formal worship and devotions for long?"
Sri Ramakrishna and M. were now conversing alone.
M: "Sir, if it is God Himself who has become everything, then why do people have so
many different feelings?"
MASTER: "Undoubtedly God exists in all beings as the All-pervading Spirit, but the
manifestations of His Power are different in different beings. In some places there is a
manifestation of the power of Knowledge; in others, of the power of ignorance. In some
places there is a greater manifestation of power than in others. Don't you see that
among human beings there are cheats and gamblers, to say nothing of men who are like
tigers. I think of them as the 'cheat God', the 'tiger God'."
M. (with a smile): "We should salute them from a distance. If we go near the 'tiger God'
and embrace him, he may devour us."
MASTER: "He and His Power, Brahman and Its Power-nothing else exists but this. In a
hymn to Rāma, Nārada said: 'O Rāma, You are Śiva, and Sita is Bhagavati; You are
Brahma, and Sita is Brahmani; You are Indra, and Sita is Indrani; You are Narayana,
and Sita is Lakshmi. O Rāma, You are the symbol of all that is masculine, and Sita of all
that is feminine.' "
M: "Sir, what is the Spirit-form of God like?"
Sri Ramakrishna reflected a moment and said softly: "Shall I tell you what it is like? It is
like water. . . . One understands all this through spiritual discipline.
"Believe in the form of God. It is only after attaining Brahmajnana that one sees non-
duality, the oneness of Brahman and Its Śakti. Brahman and Śakti are identical, like fire
and its power to burn. When a man thinks of fire, he must also think of its power to
burn. Again, when he thinks of the power to burn, he must also think of fire. Further,
Brahman and Śakti are like milk and its whiteness, water and its wetness.
Vijnāna or Transcendental Knowledge
"But there is a stage beyond even Brahmajnana. After jnāna comes vijnāna. He who is
aware of knowledge is also aware of ignorance. The sage Vasishtha was stricken with
grief at the death of his hundred sons. Asked by Lakshmana why a man of knowledge
318should grieve for such a reason, Rāma said, 'Brother, go beyond both knowledge and
ignorance.' He who has knowledge has ignorance also. If a thorn has entered your foot,
get another thorn and with its help take out the first; then throwaway the second also."
M: "Should one throwaway both knowledge and ignorance?"
MASTER: "Yes. That is why one should acquire vijnāna. You see, he who is aware of
light is also aware of darkness. He who is aware of happiness is also aware of suffering.
He who is aware of virtue is also aware of vice. He who is aware of good is also aware of
evil. He who is aware of holiness is also aware of unholiness. He who is aware of 'I' is
also aware of 'you'.
"What is vijnāna? It is knowing God in a special way. The awareness and conviction that
fire exists in wood is jnāna, knowledge. But to cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and
get nourishment from it is vijnāna. To know by one's inner experience that God exists is
jnāna. But to talk to Him, to enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as Beloved, is
vijnāna. The realization that God alone has become the universe and all living beings is
vijnāna.
"According to one school of thought, God cannot be seen. Who sees whom? Is God
outside you, that you can see Him? One sees only oneself. Having once entered the
'black waters' of the ocean, the ship does not come back and so cannot describe what it
experiences."
M: "It is true, sir. As you say, having climbed to the top of the monument, one becomes
unaware of what is below: horses and carriages, men and women, houses, shops and
offices, and so on."
MASTER: "I don't go to the Kāli temple nowadays. Is that an offence? At one time
Narendra used to say, 'What? He still goes to the Kāli temple!' "
M: "Every day you are in a new state of mind. How can you ever offend God?"
MASTER: "Someone said to Sen, about Hriday: 'He is very ill. Please bring two pieces of
cloth and a couple of shirts for him. We will send them to his village.' Sen offered only
two rupees. How do you explain that? He has so much money, and yet he is so miserly!
What do you say to that?"
M: "Those who seek God cannot behave that way-I mean those whose goal is the
attainment of Knowledge."
MASTER: "God alone is the Reality and all else is unreal."
Saturday, September 22, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna was seated in the drawing-room of Adhar's house in Calcutta, with
Rākhāl , Adhar, M., Ishan, and other devotees. Many gentlemen of the neighbourhood
were also present. It was afternoon.
319The Master was very fond of Ishan. He had been a superintendent in the Accountant
General's office, and later on his children also occupied high government positions. One
of them was a class-mate of Narendra. Ishan's purse was always open for the poor and
needy. When he retired from service, he devoted his time to spiritual practices and
charity. He often visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar.
MASTER (to Ishan): "Please tell us the story of the boy who posted the letter."
ISHAN (with a smile): "A boy once heard that God is our Creator. So he wrote a letter
to God, setting forth his prayers, and posted it. The address he put on the envelope was
'Heaven'."
MASTER (with a smile): "Did you hear that story? One succeeds in spiritual life when
one develops a faith like that boy's. (To Ishan) Tell us about the renunciation of
activities."
ISHAN: "After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the sandyha drop away.
One day some people were sitting on the bank of the Ganges performing the sandyha.
But one of them abstained from it. On being asked the reason, he said: 'I am observing
asoucha. I cannot perform the sandyha ceremony.8 In my case the defilement is due to
both a birth and a death. My mother, Ignorance, is dead, and my son, Self-Knowledge,
has been born.'"
MASTER: "Tell us, also, how caste distinctions drop away when one attains Self-
Knowledge."
ISHAN: "Sankaracharya was once climbing the steps after finishing his bath in the
Ganges, when he saw just in front of him an untouchable who had a pack of dogs with
him. 'You have touched me!' said Sankara. 'Revered sir,' said the pariah, 'I have not
touched you, nor have you touched me. The Self is the Inner Ruler of all beings and
cannot be contaminated. Is there any difference between the sun's reflection in wine
and its reflection in the Ganges?' "
MASTER (with a smile): "And about harmony: how one can realize God through all
paths."
Ishan (smiling): "Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference is
only in the pratyaya. In reality, He who is Hari is also Hara. If a man has faith in God,
then it doesn't matter whom he worships."
MASTER: "And please tell us also how the heart of the sādhu is the greatest of all."
ISHAN: "This earth is the largest thing we see anywhere around us. But larger than the
earth is the ocean, and larger than the ocean is the sky. But Vishnu, the Godhead, has
covered earth, sky, and the nether world with one of His feet. And that foot of Vishnu is
enshrined in the sādhu's heart. Therefore the heart of a holy man is the greatest of all."
320The devotees were delighted with Ishan's words.
Ishan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri,
through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman
was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it
was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in
the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged
people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Śakti,
the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.
MASTER (to Ishan): "Why do you waste your time simply repeating 'Neti, neti'? Nothing
whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists.
"Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial
Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings
and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema-all these
are manifestations of the glory of that Power.
"But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised
Rāma, saying: 'O Rāma, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Śakti. You and
She are identical' Brahman and Śakti are like the snake and. its wriggling motion.
Thinking of the snake, one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its
wriggling motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness.
Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is, whiteness, and thinking of the
whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like water and its
wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness
of water, one has to think of water.
"This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is
withdrawn, one realizes: 'I am what I was before', 'I am Thou; Thou art I'.
"As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula 'I am He', that is, man is the
Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply. The wave is part of the water, but the water
is not part of the wave. As long as that covering remains, one should call on God as
Mother. Addressing God, the devotee should say, 'Thou art the Mother and I am Thy
child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.' It is good to have the attitude of the
servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other
attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so
forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, 'Come, sit by my side;
there is no difference between you and me.' But if the servant comes forward of his own
will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?
"God's play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the ChitŚakti,
the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rāma, Krishna, and Śiva."
ISHAN: "Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference
lies only in the pratyaya."
321MASTER: "Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak of It as 'Om
Satchidananda Brahma', the Puranas as 'Om Satchidananda Krishna,' and the Tantra as
'Om Satchidananda Śiva'.
"The ChitŚakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyātma
Rāmāyana that when the rishis saw Rāma, they prayed to Him in these words only: 'O
Rāma, please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.' "
ISHAN: "What is this maya?"
MASTER: "Whatever you see, think, or hear is maya. In a word, 'woman and gold' is the
covering of maya.
"There is no harm in chewing betel-leaf, eating fish, smoking, or rubbing the body with
oil. What will one achieve by renouncing only these things? The one thing needful is the
renunciation of 'woman and gold'. That renunciation is the real and supreme
renunciation. Householders should go into solitude now and then, to practise spiritual
discipline in order to cultivate devotion to God; they should renounce mentally. But the
sannyasi should renounce both mentally and physically.
"I once said to Keshab, 'How can a typhoid patient be cured if he remains in a room
where a pitcher of water and a jar of pickles are kept?' Now and then one should live in
solitude ".
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what do you think of the Navavidhan? It seems to me like a
hotchpotch of everything."
MASTER: "Some say it is a modern thing. That sets me wondering: 'Then is the God of
the Brahmo Samaj a new God?' The Brahmos speak of their cult as the Navavidhan, as a
New Dispensation. Well, it may be so. Who knows? There are six systems of
philosophy; so perhaps it is like one of these.
"But do you know where those who speak of the formless God make their mistake? It is
where they say that God is formless only, and that those who differ with them are
wrong.
"But I know that God is both with and without form. And He may have many more
aspects. It is possible for Him to be everything.
(To Ishan) "The ChitŚakti, Mahamaya, has become the twenty-four cosmic principles.
One day as I was meditating, my mind wandered away to Rashke's house. He is a
scavenger. I said to my mind, 'Stay there, you rogue!' The Divine Mother revealed to
me that the men and women in this house were mere masks; inside them was the same
Divine Power, Kundalini, that rises up through the six spiritual centres of the body.
"Is the Primal Energy man or woman? Once at Kamarpukur I saw the worship of Kāli in
the house of the Lahas. They put a sacred thread.11 on the image of the Divine
322Mother. One man asked, 'Why have they put the sacred thread on the Mother's person?'
The master of the house said: 'Brother, I see that you have rightly understood the
Mother. But I do not yet know whether the Divine Mother is male or female.'
"It is said that Mahamaya swallowed Śiva. When the six centres in Her were awakened,
Śiva came out through Her thigh. Then Śiva created the Tantra philosophy.
"Take refuge in the ChitŚakti, the Mahamaya."
ISHAN: "Please bestow your grace on me."
MASTER: "Say to God with a guileless heart, 'O God, reveal Thyself to
me.' And weep. Pray to God, 'O God, keep my mind away from "woman, and gold".' And
dive deep. Can a man get pearls by floating or swimming on the surface? He must dive
deep.
Faith in the guru
"One must get instruction from a guru. Once a man was looking for a stone image of
Śiva. Someone said to him: 'Go to a certain river. There you will find a tree. Near it is
a whirlpool. Dive into the water there, and you will find the image of Śiva.' So I say
that one must get instruction from a teacher."
ISHAN: "That is true, sir."
MASTER: "It is Satchidananda that comes to us in the form of the guru. If a man is
initiated by a human guru, he will not achieve anything if he regards his guru as a mere
man. The guru should be regarded as the direct manifestation of God. Only then can
the disciple have faith in the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he,
achieves all. The sudra Ekalavya learnt archery in the forest before a clay image of
Drona; He worshipped the image as the living Drona; that by itself enabled him to attain
mastery in archery.
"Don't mix intimately with brahmin pundits. Their only concern is to earn money. I
have seen brahmin priests reciting the Chandi while performing the swastyayana. It is
hard to tell whether they are reading the sacred book or something else. They turn half
the pages without reading them. (All laugh.)
"A nail-knife suffices to kill oneself. One needs sword and shield to kill others. That is
the purpose of the sastras.
"One doesn't really need to study the different scriptures. If one has no discrimination,
one doesn't achieve anything through mere scholarship, even though one studies all the
six systems of philosophy. Call on God, crying to Him secretly in solitude. He will give
all that you need."
Sri Ramakrishna had heard that Ishan was building a house on the bank of the Ganges
for the practice of spiritual discipline. He asked Ishan eagerly: "Has the house been
323built? Let me tell you that the less people know of your spiritual life, the better it will be
for you. Devotees endowed with sattva meditate in a secluded corner or in a forest, or
withdraw into the mind. Sometimes they meditate inside the mosquito net."
Now and then Ishan invited Hazra to his house. Hazra had a craze for outward purity.
Sri Ramakrishna often discouraged him in this.
MASTER (to Ishan): "Let me tell you another thing. Don't be over-fastidious about
outward purity. Once a sādhu felt very thirsty. A water-carrier was carrying water in his
skin water-bag, and offered the water to the holy man. The sādhu asked if the skin was
clean. The carrier said: 'Revered sir; my skin bag is perfectly clean. But inside your skin
are all sorts of filthy things. That is why I can ask you to drink water from my skin. It
won't injure you.' By 'your skin', the carrier meant the body, the belly, and so forth.
"Have faith in the name of God. Then you won't need even to go to holy places."
Sri Ramakrishna sang, intoxicated with divine fervour:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli's name upon my lips?
Ishan remained silent.
MASTER (to Ishan): "Tell me if you have any more doubts."
ISHAN: "You said everything when you spoke of faith."
MASTER: "God can be realized by true faith alone. And the realization is hastened if you
believe everything about God. The cow that picks and chooses its food gives milk only in
dribblets, but if she eats all kinds of plants, then her milk flows in torrents.
"Once I heard a story. A man heard the command of God that he should see his Ideal
Deity in a ram. He at once believed it. It is God who exists in all beings.
"A guru said to his disciple, 'It is Rāma alone who resides in all bodies.' The disciple was
a man of great faith. One day a dog snatched a piece of bread from him and started to
run away. He ran after the dog, with a jar of butter in his hand, and cried again and
again: 'O Rāma, stand still a minute. That bread hasn't been buttered.'
"What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, 'By chanting "Om Krishna,
Om Rāma", one gets the result of a million sandhyas.' Once he said to me secretly, 'I
don't like the sandhya and other devotions any more; but don't tell anyone.'
"Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She Herself has become
everything. One day I was coming from the pine-grove toward the Panchavati. A dog
followed me. I stood still for a while near the Panchavati. The thought came to my mind
that the Mother might say something to me through that dog.
324"You were absolutely right when you said that through faith alone one achieves all."
ISHAN: "But we are householders."
MASTER: "What if you are? Through His grace even the impossible becomes possible.
Ramprasad sang, 'This world is a mere framework of illusion.' Another man composed a
song by way of reply:
This very world is a mansion of mirth;
Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.
Janaka's might was unsurpassed;
What did he lack of the world or the Spirit?
Holding to one as well as the other,
He drank his milk from a brimming cup!

"One should first realize God through spiritual discipline in solitude, and then live in the
world. Only then can one be a King Janaka. What can you achieve otherwise?
"Further, take the case of Śiva. He has everything-Kartika, Ganesa, Lakshmi, and
Sarasvati. Still, sometimes He dances in a state of divine fervour, chanting the name of
Rāma, and sometimes He is absorbed in samādhi."
