About 5PM, Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the temple of the Brahmo Samaj in Nandanbagan, accompanied by M., Rakhal, and a few other devotees.

At first the Master sat in the drawing-room on the ground floor, where the Brahmo devotees
gradually assembled. 

Rabindranath Tagore and a few other members of the Tagore family were present.

Sri Ramakrishna was asked to go to the worship hall on the second floor. A dais had been built on the eastern side of the room. There were a few chairs and a piano in the
hall. The Brahmo worship was to begin at dusk. 


"Narendra once asked me, 'What good is there in bowing before the Brahmo Samaj temple?' The sight of the temple recalls to my mind God alone; then God-Consciousness is kindled in my mind. God is present where people talk about Him. One feels there the presence of all the holy
places. Places of worship recall God alone to my mind.

"Once a devotee was overwhelmed with ecstasy at the sight of a babla-tree. The idea flashed in his mind that the handle of the axe used in the garden of the temple of
Radhakanta was made from the wood of the babla. Another devotee had such devotion for his guru that he would be overwhelmed with divine feeling at the sight of his guru's
neighbours. Krishna-consciousness would be kindled in Radha's mind at the sight of a
cloud, a blue dress, or a painting of Krishna. She would become restless and cry like a
mad person, 'Krishna, where art Thou?' "

GHOSAL: "But madness is not desirable."

MASTER: "What do you mean? Was Radha's madness the madness that comes from brooding over worldly objects and makes one unconscious? One attains that madness by
meditating on God. Haven't you heard of love-madness and knowledge-madness?"

A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "How can one realize God?"

MASTER: "By directing your love to Him and constantly reasoning that God alone is real and the world illusory. The Aśwattha tree alone is permanent; its fruit is transitory."
How to spiritualize the passions 

BRAHMO: "We have passions like anger and lust. What shall we do with these?"

MASTER: "Direct the six passions to God. The impulse of lust should be turned into the desire to have intercourse with Ātman. Feel angry at those who stand in your way to
God. Feel greedy for Him. If you must have the feeling of I and Mine, then associate it with God. Say, for instance, 'My Rama, my Krishna.' If you must have pride, then feel
like Bibhishana, who said, 'I have touched the feet of Rama with my head; I will not bow this head before anyone else.'"

BRAHMO: "If it is God that makes me do everything, then I am not responsible for my sins."

MASTER (with a smile): "Yes, Duryodhana also said that. 'O Krishna, I do what Thou, seated in my heart, makest me do.' If a man has the firm conviction that God alone is
the Doer and he is His instrument, then he cannot do anything sinful. He who has learnt to dance correctly never makes a false step. One cannot even believe in the existence of God until one's heart becomes pure."

Sri Ramakrishna looked at the devotees assembled in the worship hall and said: "It is very good to gather in this way, now and then, and think of God and sing His name and
glories. But the worldly man's yearning for God is momentary. It lasts as long as a drop of water on a red-hot frying-pan."

The worship was about to begin, and the big hall was filled with Brahmo devotees. Some of the Brahmo ladies sat on chairs, with music books in their hands. The songs of
the Brahmo Samaj were sung to the accompaniment of harmonium and piano. Sri Ramakrishna's joy was unbounded. The invocation was followed by a prayer, and then
the worship began. The acharyas, seated on the platform, recited from the Vedas:

Om. Thou art our Father. Give us right knowledge; do not destroy us! We bow to Thee.

The Brahmo devotees chanted in chorus with the acharyas:

Om. Brahman is Truth, Knowledge, Infinity.
It shines as Bliss and Immortality.
Brahman is Peace, Blessedness, and the One without a Second;
It is pure and unstained by sin.
The acharyas chanted in praise of God:
Om. O Reality, Cause of the Universe, we bow to Thee!
Then the acharyas chanted their prayer together:
From the unreal lead us to the Real;
From darkness lead us to Light;
From death lead us to Immortality.
Reach us through and through,
O Rudra, and protect us evermore with Thy Compassionate
Face.
As Sri Ramakrishna heard these hymns, he went into a spiritual mood. After this an
Āchārya read a paper.
The worship was over. Most of the devotees went downstairs or to the courtyard for
fresh air while the refreshments were being made ready. It was about nine o'clock in
the evening. The hosts were so engrossed with the other invited guests that they forgot
to pay any attention to Sri Ramakrishna.
243MASTER (to Rakhal and the other devotees): "What's the matter? Nobody is paying any
attention to us!"
RAKHAL (angrily): "Sir, Let us leave here and go to Dakshineswar."
MASTER (with a smile): "Keep quiet! The carriage hire is three rupees and two ānnās .
Who will pay that? Stubbornness won't get us anywhere. You haven't a penny, and you
are making these empty threats! Besides, where shall we find food at this late hour of
the night?"
After a long time dinner was announced. The devotees were asked to take their seats.
The Master, with Rakhal and the others, followed the crowd to the second floor. No
room could be found for him inside the hall. Finally, with great difficulty, a place was
found for him in a dusty corner. A brahmin woman served some curry, but Sri
Ramakrishna could not eat it. He ate luchi with salt and took some sweets.
There was no limit to the Master's kindness. The hosts were mere youngsters; how
could he be displeased with them, even though they did not show him proper respect?
Further, it would have been inauspicious for the household if a holy man had left the
place without taking food. Finally the feast had been prepared in the name of God.
Sri Ramakrishna got into a carriage: but who was to pay the hire? The hosts could not
be found. Referring to this incident afterwards, the Master said to the devotees,
jokingly: "The boys went to our hosts for the carriage hire. First they were put out, but
at last they managed to get together three rupees. Our hosts refused to pay the extra
two ānnās and said, 'No, that will do.' "

The Master paid a visit to the Hari-Bhakti-Pradayini-Sabha of Kansharipara, in Calcutta,
on the anniversary day of that religious society. Kirtan and other forms of devotional
music had been arranged for the occasion. The songs centred round the Vrindāvan
episode of Sri Krishna's life. The theme was Radha's pique because of Sri Krishna's
having visited Chandravali, another of the gopis of Vrindāvan. Radha's friends tried to
console her and said to her: "Why are you piqued? It seems you are not thinking of
Krishna's happiness, but only of your own." Radha said to them: "I am not angry at His
going to Chandravali's grove. But why should He go there? She doesn't know how to
take care of Him."
May 20,1883
The following Sunday a kirtan was arranged at the house of Ram, one of the Master's
householder devotees. Sri Ramakrishna graced the occasion with his presence. The
musicians sang about Radha's pangs at her separation from Krishna:
Radha said to her friends: "I have loved to see Krishna from my childhood. My finger-
nails are worn off from counting the days on them till I shall see Him. Once He gave me
a garland. Look, it has withered, but I have not yet thrown it away. Alas! Where has
the Moon of Krishna risen now? Has that Moon gone away from my firmament, afraid of
244the Rahu of my pique? Alas! Shall I ever see Krishna again? O my beloved Krishna, I
have never been able to look at You to my heart's complete satisfaction. I have only
one pair of eyes; they blink and so hinder my vision. And further, on account of streams
of tears I could not see enough of my Beloved. The peacock feather on the crown of His
head shines like arrested lightning. The peacocks, seeing Krishna's dark-cloud
complexion, would dance in joy, spreading their tails. O friends, I shall not be able to
keep my life-breath. After my death, place my body on a branch of the dark tamala tree
and inscribe on my body Krishna's sweet name."
The Master said: "God and His name are identical; that is the reason Radha said that.
There is no difference between Rama and His holy name."
May 27, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna was in his room at Dakshineswar, conversing with the devotees. It was
about nine o'clock in the morning.
Religious quarrels condemned
MASTER (to M. and the other devotees): "It is not good to harbour malice. The Saktas,
the Vaishnavas, and the Vedantists quarrel among themselves. That is not wise.
Padmalochan was court pundit of the Maharaja of Burdwan. Once at a meeting the
pundits were discussing whether Śiva was superior to Brahma, or Brahma to Śiva.
Padmalochan gave an appropriate reply. 'I don't know anything about it', said he. 'I
haven't talked either to Śiva or to Brahma.'
Single-minded devotion
"If people feel sincere longing, they will find that all paths lead to God. But one should
have nishtha, single-minded devotion. It is also described as chaste and unswerving
devotion to God. It is like a tree with only one trunk shooting straight up. Promiscuous
devotion is like a tree with five branches.
Such was the single-minded devotion of the gopis to Krishna that they didn't care to look
at anyone but the Krishna they had seen at Vrindāvan-the Shepherd Krishna, bedecked
with a garland of yellow wild-flowers and wearing a peacock feather on His crest. At the
sight of Krishna at Mathura with a turban on His head and dressed in royal robes, the
gopis pulled down their veils. They would not look at His face. 'Who is this man?' they
said. 'Should we violate our chaste love for Krishna by talking to him?'
"The devotion of the wife to her husband is also an instance of unswerving love. She
feeds her brothers-in-law as well, and looks after their comforts, but she has a special
relationship with her husband. Likewise, one may have that single-minded devotion to
one's own religion; but one should not on that account hate other faiths. On the
contrary, one should have a friendly attitude, toward them."
The Master bathed in the Ganges and then went to the Kāli temple with M. He sat before
the image and offered flowers at the feet of the Divine Mother. Now and then he put
flowers on his own head and meditated.
245After a long time he stood up. He was in a spiritual mood and danced before the image,
chanting the name of Kāli. Now and again he said: "O Mother! O Destroyer of suffering!
O Remover of grief and agony!" Was he teaching people thus to pray to the Mother of
the Universe with a yearning heart, in order to get rid of the suffering inevitable in
physical life?
Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room and sat on the west porch. Rakhal, M., Nakur
Vaishnav, and other devotees were with him. Nakur had been known to the Master for
about twenty-five years. He was a devotee of Gauranga and had a small shop which Sri
Ramakrishna had often visited when he first came to Calcutta from Kamarpukur.
Still overpowered with divine ecstasy, the Master sang:
O Kāli, my Mother full of Bliss! Enchantress of the almighty
Śiva!
In Thy delirious joy Thou dancest, clapping Thy hands
together!
Eternal One! Thou great First Cause, clothed in the form of the
Void
Thou wearest the moon upon Thy brow,
Where didst Thou find Thy garland of heads before the universe
was made?
Thou art the Mover of all that move, and we are but Thy
helpless toys;
We move alone as Thou movest us and speak as through us
Thou speakest.
But worthless Kamalakanta says, fondly berating Thee:
Confoundress! With Thy flashing sword
Thoughtlessly Thou hast put to death my virtue and my sin
alike!
He sang again:
Mother, Thou art our sole Redeemer,
Thou the Support of the three gunas,
Higher than the most high.
Thou art compassionate, I know,
Who takest away our bitter grief.
Sandhya art Thou, and Gayatri;
Thou dost sustain this universe.
Mother, the Help art Thou
Of those that have no help but Thee,
O Eternal Beloved of Śiva!
Thou art in earth, in water Thou;
Thou liest at the root of all.
In me, in every creature,
246Thou hast Thy home; though clothed with form,
Yet art Thou formless Reality.
The Master sang a few more songs in praise of the Divine Mother. Then he said to the
devotees: "It is not always best to tell householders about the sorrows of life. They
want bliss. Those who suffer from chronic poverty can go without food for a day or two.
But it is not wise to talk about the sorrows and miseries of life to those who suffer if their
food is delayed a few minutes. Vaishnavcharan used to say: 'Why should one constantly
dwell on sin? Be merry!' "
While the Master was resting after his midday meal, Manohor Goswami, a singer of
kirtan, arrived. He sang about the ecstatic love of Gauranga and the divine episode of
Vrindāvan. The Master was absorbed in a deep spiritual mood. He tore off his shirt and
said, to the melody of the kirtan, assuming the attitude of Radha: "O Krishna, my
Beloved! O friends, bring Krishna to me. Then you will be real friends. Or take me to
Him, and I will be your slave for ever."
The musician sat spellbound at Sri Ramakrishna's ecstasy; then he said with folded
hands, "Won't you please rid me of my worldliness?"
MASTER: "You are like the holy man who went about the city after first finding a
lodging. You are a sweet person and express many sweet ideas."
MUSICIAN: "Sir, I am like the bullock that only carries the bag of sugar but cannot taste
it. Alas, I myself do not enjoy the sweetness of divine bliss."
The melodious music went on, and all were filled with joy.
Saturday, June 2, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna had been invited to visit the homes of his devotees Balaram, Adhar,
and Ram in Calcutta. Devotional music had been arranged by Adhar and Ram. The
Master was accompanied in the carriage by Rakhal, M., and others.
As they drove along, Sri Ramakrishna said to the devotees: "You see, sin flies away
when love of God grows in a man's heart, even as the water of the reservoir dug in a
meadow dries up under the heat of the sun. But one cannot love God if one feels
attracted to worldly things, to 'woman and gold'. Merely taking the vow of monastic life
will not help a man if he is attached to the world. It is like swallowing your own spittle
after spitting it out on the ground."
After a few minutes the Master continued: 'The members of the Brahmo Samaj do not
accept God with form. Narendra says that God with form is a mere idol. He says
further: 'What? He still goes to the Kāli temple!'"
Sri Ramakrishna and his party arrived at Balaram's house. Yajnanath of Nandanbagan
came to invite the Master to his house at four o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna
agreed to go if he felt well. After Yajnanath's departure the Master went into an ecstatic
247mood. He said to the Divine Mother: "Mother, what is all this? Stop! What are these
things Thou art showing to me? What is it that Thou dost reveal to me through Rakhal
and others? The form is disappearing. But, Mother, what people call 'man' is only a
pillow-case, nothing but a pillow-case. Consciousness is Thine alone.
"The modern Brahmajnanis have not tasted Thy sweet bliss. Their eyes look dry and so
do their faces. They won't achieve anything without ecstatic love of God.
"Mother, once I asked Thee to give me a companion just like myself. Is that why Thou
hast given me Rakhal?"
The Master went to Adhar's house, where arrangements were being made for the kirtan.
Many devotees and neighbours had gathered in Adhar's drawing-room, anxious to listen
to the Master's words.
