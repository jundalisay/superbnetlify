## The World of Duality & Transcendental nature of Brahman

Sri Ramakrishna's conversation now turned to the Knowledge of Brahman.

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Brahman is beyond vidyā and avidyā, knowledge and ignorance. It is beyond maya, the illusion of duality.

The world consists of the illusory duality of knowledge and ignorance. It contains knowledge and devotion, and also attachment to 'Woman and gold'; righteousness and unrighteousness; good and evil. 

But Brahman is unattached to these. Good and evil apply to the jiva, the individual soul, as do righteousness and unrighteousness; but Brahman is not at all affected by them.

"One man may read the Bhagavata by the light of a lamp, and another may commit a forgery by that very light; but the lamp is unaffected. The sun sheds its light on the wicked as well as on the virtuous.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Vidyasagar" >}}
How then can one explain misery, sin, and unhappiness?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Misery, sin, and unhappiness apply only to the jiva. Brahman is unaffected by them. There is poison in a snake. Others may die if bitten by it. But the snake itself is not affected by the poison.

What Brahman is cannot he described. All things in the world - the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, the six systems of philosophy - have been defiled because they have been read or uttered by the tongue, like food that has been touched by the tongue. 

Only the Brahman has not been defiled in this way. No one has ever been able to say what Brahman is."

{{< r a="Vidyasagar" >}}
(to his friends): "Oh! That is a remarkable statement. I have learnt something new today."
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
A man had two sons. The father sent them to a preceptor to learn the Knowledge of Brahman. 

After a few years, they returned from their preceptor's house and bowed low before their father. Wanting to measure the depth of their knowledge of Brahman, he first questioned the older of the two boys. 

'My child,' he said, 'You have studied all the scriptures. What is the nature of Brahman?' 

The boy explained Brahman by reciting various texts from the Vedas. Then he asked the younger son the same question. 

The boy remained silent and stood with eyes cast down. No word escaped his lips. The father was pleased and said to him: 'My child, you have understood a little of Brahman. What It is cannot be expressed in words.'

## Parable of ant and sugar hill

Men often think they have understood Brahman fully. Once an ant went to a hill of sugar. 

One grain filled its stomach. Taking another grain in its mouth it started homeward. On its way it thought, 'Next time I shall carry home the whole hill.' That is the way shallow minds think. They don't know that Brahman is beyond one's words and
thought. However great a man may be, how much can he know of Brahman? Sukadeva
and sages like him may have been big ants; but even they could carry at the utmost
eight or ten grains of sugar!

"As for what has been said in the Vedas and the Puranas, do you know what it is like? Suppose a man has seen the ocean, and somebody asks him, 'Well, what is the ocean like?' 

The first man opens his mouth as wide as he can and says: 'What a sight! What tremendous waves and sounds!' The description of Brahman in the sacred books is like that. 

It is said in the Vedas that Brahman is of the nature of Bliss - It is Satchidananda. 

"Suka and other sages stood on the shore of this Ocean of Brahman and saw and touched the water. According to one school of thought they never plunged into it. Those who do, cannot come back to the world again.


## Parable of salt doll

"In samādhi one attains the Knowledge of Brahman - one realizes Brahman. In that state reasoning stops altogether, and man becomes mute. He has no power to describe the nature of Brahman.

"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. (All laugh.) 

It wanted to tell others how deep the water was. But this it could never do, for no sooner did it get into
the water than it melted. Now who was there to report the ocean's depth?"

A DEVOTEE: "Suppose a man has obtained the Knowledge of Brahman in samādhi. Doesn't he speak any more?"

MASTER: "Sankaracharya retained the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach others. After the vision of Brahman a man becomes silent. He reasons about It as long as he has not realized It. 

If you heat butter in a pan on the stove, it makes a sizzling sound as long as the water it contains has not dried up. But when no trace of water is left the clarified butter makes no sound. 

If you put an uncooked cake of flour in that butter it sizzles again. But after the cake is cooked all sound stops. Just so, a man established in samādhi comes down to the relative plane of consciousness in order to teach others, and
then he talks about God.

"The bee buzzes as long as it is not sitting on a flower. It becomes silent when it begins to sip the honey. But sometimes, intoxicated with the honey, it buzzes again. 

"An empty pitcher makes a gurgling sound when it is dipped in water. When it fills up it becomes silent. (All laugh.) But if the water is poured from it into another pitcher, then you will hear the sound again. 

(Laughter.)


## Rishis of ancient India

"The rishis of old attained the Knowledge of Brahman. One cannot have this so long as there is the slightest trace of worldliness. How hard the rishis laboured! 

Early in the morning they would go away from the hermitage, and would spend the whole day in solitude, meditating on Brahman. At night they would return to the hermitage and eat a little fruit or roots. 

They kept their minds aloof from the objects of sight, hearing, touch, and other things of a worldly nature. Only thus did they realize Brahman as their own inner consciousness.

"But in the Kaliyuga, man is totally dependent on food for life. He cannot shake off the idea that he is the body.

In this state of mind, it is not proper for him to say, 'I am He.' When a man does all sorts of worldly things, he should not say, 'I am
Brahman.' 

Those who cannot give up attachment to worldly things, and who find no means to shake off the feeling of 'I', should rather cherish the idea 'I am God's servant; 

I am His devotee.' One can also realize God by following the path of devotion.

## Jnani and Vijnāni

The jnani gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating, 'Not this, not this'. 

Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching the roof of a house by leaving the steps behind, one by one. But the vijnāni, who is more intimately acquainted with Brahman, realizes something more. He realizes that the steps are made
of the same materials as the roof: bricks, lime, and brick-dust. 

That which is realized intuitively as Brahman, through the eliminating process of 'Not this, not this', is then found to have become the universe and all its living beings. 

The vijnāni sees that the Reality which is nirguna, without attributes, is also saguna, with attributes.

"A man cannot live on the roof a long time. He comes down again. Those who realize Brahman in samādhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become the universe and its living beings. 

In the musical scale there are the notes sa, re ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni. One cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a long time. 

The ego does not vanish altogether. 

The man coming down from samādhi perceives that it is Brahman that has become the ego, the universe, and all living beings. This is known as vijnāna. 

## Path of love is easy

"The path of knowledge leads to Truth, as does the path that combines knowledge and love. The path of love, too, leads to this goal. The way of love is as true as the way of knowledge. 

All paths ultimately lead to the same Truth. But as long as God keeps the feeling of ego in us, it is easier to follow the path of love.

"The vijnāni sees that Brahman is immovable and actionless, like Mount Sumeru. This universe consists of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas. They are in Brahman. But Brahman is unattached.


## God's supernatural powers

"The vijnāni further sees that what is Brahman is the Bhagavan, the Personal God. He
who is beyond the three gunas is the Bhagavan, with His six supernatural powers.
Living beings, the universe, mind, intelligence, love, renunciation, knowledge - all these
are the manifestations of His power. (With a laugh) If an aristocrat has neither house
nor property, or if he has been forced to sell them, one doesn't call him an aristocrat any
more. (All laugh.) God is endowed with the six supernatural powers. If He were not
who would obey Him? (All laugh.)

## Different manifestations of God's power

"Just see how picturesque this universe is! How many things there are! The sun, moon, and stars; and how many varieties of living beings! - big and small, good and bad,
strong and weak - some endowed with more power some with less." 

VIDYASAGAR: "Has He endowed some with more power and others with less?"

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
As the All-pervading Spirit He exists in all beings, even in the ant. But the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings; otherwise, how can one
person put ten to flight, while another can't face even one? And why do all people respect you? 

Have you grown a pair horns? (Laughter.) You have more compassion and learning. Therefore people honour you and come to pay you their respects. Don't you
agree with me?"

There is nothing in mere scholarship. The object of study is to find means of knowing God and realizing Him. A holy man had a book. When asked
what it contained, he opened it and showed that on all the pages were written the words 'Om Rama', and nothing else.

"What is the significance of the Gita? It is what you find by repeating the word 10 times. It is then reversed into 'tagi', which means a person who has renounced
everything for God. And the lesson of. the Gita is: 'O man, renounce everything and seek God alone.' Whether a man is a monk or a householder, he has to shake off all
attachment from his mind. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
"Chaitanyadeva set out on a pilgrimage to southern India. One day he saw a man reading the Gita. Another man, seated at a distance, was listening and weeping. His
eyes were swimming in tears. Chaitanyadeva asked him, 'Do you understand all this?'

The man said, 'No, revered sir, I don't understand a word of the text.' 'Then why are you crying?' asked Chaitanya. The devotee said: 'I see Arjuna's chariot before me. I see
Lord Krishna and Arjuna seated in front of it, talking. I see this and I weep.' 

"Why does a vijnāni keep an attitude of love toward God? The answer is that 'I- consciousness' persists. It disappears in the state of samādhi, no doubt, but it comes
back. In the case of ordinary people the 'I' never disappears. You may cut down the
Aśwattha tree, but the next day sprouts shoot up. (All laugh.)
{{< /l >}}



{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
"Even after the attainment of Knowledge this 'I-consciousness' comes up, nobody knows from where. You dream of a tiger. Then you awake; but your heart keeps on
palpitating! All our suffering is due to this 'I'. The cow cries, 'Hamba!', which means 'I'.
That is why it suffers so much. It is yoked to the plough and made to work in rain and
sun. Then it may be killed by the butcher. From its hide shoes are made, and also drums, which are mercilessly, beaten. (Laughter.) Still it does not escape suffering. At
last strings are made out of its entrails for the bows used in carding cotton. 

Then it no longer says, 'Hamba! Hamba!', 'I! I!' but 'Tuhu! Tuhu!', 'Thou! Thou!'. Only then are its
troubles over.

O Lord, I am the servant; Thou art the Master. I am the child; Thou art
the Mother.
{{< /l >}}


Once Rama asked Hanuman, 'How do you look on Me?' And Hanuman replied: 'O Rama,
as long as I have the feeling of "I", I see that Thou art the whole and I am a part; Thou
art the Master and I am Thy servant. But when, O Rama, I have the knowledge of
Truth, then I realize that Thou art I and I am Thou.'
"The relationship of master and servant is the proper one. Since this 'I' must remain, let
the rascal be God's servant.

Evil of "I" and "mine"

"'I' and 'mine' - these constitute ignorance. 'My house', 'my wealth', 'my learning', 'my
possessions' - the attitude that prompts one to say such things comes of ignorance. On
the contrary, the attitude born of Knowledge is: 'O God, Thou art the Master, and all
these things belong to Thee. House, family, children, attendants, friends, are Thine.'
"One should constantly remember death. Nothing will survive death. We are born into
this world to perform certain duties, like the people who come from the countryside to
Calcutta on business. If a visitor goes to a rich man's garden, the superintendent says
to him, 'This is our garden', 'This is our lake', and so forth. But if the Superintendent is
dismissed for some misdeed, he can't carry away even his mango-wood chest. He sends
it secretly by the gate-keeper. (Laughter.)
"God laughs on two occasions. He laughs when the physician says to the patient's
mother, 'Don't be afraid, mother; I shall certainly cure your boy.' God laughs, saying to
Himself, 'I am going to take his life, and this man says he will save it!' The physician
thinks he is the master, forgetting that God is the Master. God laughs again when two
brothers divide their land with a string, saying to each other, 'This side is mine and that
side is your'. He laughs and says to Himself, 'The whole universe belongs to Me, but
they say they own this portion or that portion.'
"Can one know God through reasoning? Be His servant, surrender yourself to Him, and
then pray to Him.

(To Vidyasagar, with a smile) "Well, what is your attitude?"
VIDYASAGAR (smiling): "Some day I shall confide it to you."(All laugh)
MASTER (laughing): "God cannot be realized through mere scholarly reasoning."
Intoxicated with divine love, the Master sang:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her.
It is She, the scriptures say, that is the Inner Self
Of the yogi, who in Self discovers all his joy;
She that, of Her own sweet will, inhabits every living thing.
117The macrocosm and microcosm rest in the Mother's womb;
Now do you see how vast it is? In the Muladhara
The yogi meditates on Her, and in the Sahasrara:
Who but Śiva has beheld Her as She really is?
Within the lotus wilderness She sports beside Her Mate, the
Swan.

When man aspires to understand Her, Ramprasad must smile;
To think of knowing Her, he says, is quite as laughable
As to imagine one can swim across the boundless sea.
But while my mind has understood, alas! my heart has not;

Though but a dwarf, it still would strive to make a captive of the moon.

Continuing, the Master said: "Did you notice?

The macrocosm and microcosm rest in the Mother's womb;

Now do you see how vast it is?

Again, the poet says:

Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her.

She cannot be realized by means of mere scholarship.

Power of faith

"One must have faith and love. Let me tell you how powerful faith is. A man was about to cross the sea from Ceylon to India. Bibhishana said to him: 'Tie this thing in a corner of your wearing-cloth, and you will cross the sea safely. You will be able to walk on the
water. But be sure not to examine it, or you will sink.' 

The man was walking easily on the water of the sea - such is the strength of faith - when, having gone part of the way,
he thought, 'What is this wonderful thing Bibhishana has given me, that I can walk even
on the water?' He untied the knot and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written
on it. 'Oh, just this!' he thought, and instantly he sank.

"There is a popular saying that Hanuman jumped over the sea through his faith in Rama's name, but Rama himself had to build a bridge.
"If a man has faith in God, then He need not be afraid though he may have committed
sin - nay, the vilest sin."

Then Sri Ramakrishna sang a song glorifying the Power of faith:

If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name,
How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,

Withhold from me deliverance,
Wretched though I may be?
The Master continued: "Faith and devotion. One realizes God easily through devotion.
He is grasped through ecstasy of love."
With these words the Master sang again:
How are you trying, O my mind, to know the nature of God?

You are groping like a madman locked in a dark room.

He is grasped through ecstatic love; how can you fathom Him without it?

Only through affirmation, never negation, can you know Him;

Neither through Veda nor through Tantra nor the 6 darsanas.

It is in love's elixir only that He delights, O mind;

He dwells in the body's inmost depths, in Everlasting Joy.

For that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to age.

When love awakes, the Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the soul.

He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother;

But must I give away the secret, here in the marketplace?

From the hints I have given, O mind, guess what that Being is!

While singing, the Master went into samādhi. He was seated on the bench, facing west, the palms of his hands joined together, his body erect and motionless. 

Everyone watched him expectantly. Vidyasagar, too, was speechless and could not take his eyes from the Master.

Brahman and Śakti are identical

After a time Sri Ramakrishna showed signs of regaining the normal state. He drew a deep breath and said with a smile: "The means of realizing God are ecstasy of love and devotion - that is, one must love God. He who is Brahman is addressed as the Mother.
He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother.

But must I give away the secret, here in the market-place?

From the hints I have given, O mind, guess what that Being is!

"Ramprasad asks the mind only to guess the nature of God. He wishes it to understand that what is called Brahman in the Vedas is addressed by Him as the Mother. He who is attributeless also has attributes. He who is Brahman is also Śakti. When thought of as
inactive, He is called Brahman, and when thought of as the Creator, Preserver, and
Destroyer, He is called the Primordial Energy, Kāli. 

"Brahman and Śakti are identical, like fire and its power to bum. When we talk of fire we automatically mean also its power to burn. Again, the fire's power to burn implies the fire itself. If you accept the one you must accept the other.

"Brahman alone is addressed as the Mother. This is because a mother is an object of great love. 

One is able to realize God just through love. Ecstasy of feeling, devotion, love, and faith - these are the means. Listen to a song:
As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;
And faith is the root of all.
If in the Nectar Lake of Mother Ka1i's feet
My mind remains immersed,
Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.
Growth of divine love lessens worldly duties
"What is needed is absorption in God - loving Him intensely. The 'Nectar Lake' is the
Lake of Immortality. A man sinking in It does not die, but becomes immortal. Some
people believe that by thinking of God too much the mind becomes deranged; but that is
not true. God is the Lake of Nectar, the Ocean of Immortality. He is called the
'Immortal' in the Vedas. Sinking in It, one does not die, but verily transcends death.
Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.
If a man comes to love God, he need not trouble himself much about these activities.
One needs a fan only as long as there is no breeze. The fan may be laid aside if the
southern breeze blows. Then what need is there of a fan?
(To Vidyasagar) "The activities that you are engaged in are good. It is very good if you
can perform them in a selfless spirit, renouncing egotism, giving up the idea that you are
the doer. Through such action one develops love and devotion to God, and ultimately
realizes Him.
"The more you come to love God, the less you will be inclined to perform action. When
the daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her less work to do. As time
goes by she is given less and less work. When the time of delivery nears, she is not
allowed to do any work at all, lest it should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time
of birth.
"By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself. If you can do
them disinterestedly, your mind will become pure and you will develop love of God. As
soon as you have that love you will realize Him.
"Man cannot really help the world. God alone does that - He who has created the sun
and the moon, who has put love for their children in parents' hearts, endowed noble
souls with compassion, and holy men and devotees with divine love. The man who
works for others, without any selfish motive, really does good to himself.

## Parable of the wood-cutter

"Go forward. A wood-cutter once entered a forest to gather wood. A brahmachari said
to him, 'Go forward.' He obeyed the injunction and discovered some sandal-wood trees.
After a few days he reflected, 'The holy man asked me to go forward. He didn't tell me
to stop here.' So he went forward and found a silver-mine. After a few days he went still
farther and discovered a gold-mine, and next, mines of diamonds and precious stones.
With these he became immensely rich.
"Through selfless work, love of God grows in the heart. Then, through His grace one
realizes Him in course of time. God can be seen. One can talk to him as I am talking to
you."
In silent wonder they all sat listening to the Master's words. It seemed to them that the
Goddess of Wisdom Herself, seated on Sri Ramakrishna's tongue was addressing these
words not merely to Vidyasagar, but to all humanity for its good.
It was nearly nine o'clock in the evening. The Master was about to leave.
Master (to Vidyasagar, with a smile): "The words I have spoken are really superfluous.
You know all this; you simply aren't conscious of it. There are countless gems in the
coffers of Varuna. But he himself isn't aware of them."
VIDYASAGAR (with a smile): "You may say as you like."

MASTER (smiling): "Oh yes. There are many wealthy people who don't know the names of all their servants, and are even unaware of many of the precious things in their houses."

(All laugh.)

Everybody was delighted with the Master's conversation. Again addressing Vidyasagar, he said with a smile: "Please visit the temple garden some time - I mean the garden of Rasmani. It's a charming place."

VIDYASAGAR: "Oh, of course I shall go. You have so kindly come here to see me, and
shall I not return your visit?"

MASTER: "Visit me? Oh, never think of such a thing!"

VIDYASAGAR: "Why, sir? Why do you say that? May I ask you to explain?"



{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
We are like small fishing-boats. We can ply in small canals and shallow waters and also in big rivers. But you are a ship. You may run
aground on the way!" (All laugh.) But even a ship can go there at this season."
{{< /l >}}


VIDYASAGR (smiling): "Yes, this is the monsoon season." (All laugh.)

M. said to himself: "This is indeed the monsoon season of newly awakened love. At such times one doesn't care for prestige or formalities."
Sri Ramakrishna then took leave of Vidyasagar, who with his friends escorted the Master to the main gate, leading the way with a lighted candle in his hand. Before leaving the room, the Master prayed for the family's welfare, going into an ecstatic mood as he did so.

As soon as the Master and the devotees reached the gate, they saw an unexpected sight and stood still. In front of them was a bearded gentleman of fair complexion, aged about thirty-six. He wore his clothes like a Bengali, but on his head was a white turban tied after the fashion of the Sikhs. No sooner did he see the Master than he fell prostrate before him, turban and all.

When he stood up the Master said: "Who is this? Balaram? Why so late in the evening?"

BALARAM: "I have been waiting here a long time, sir."

MASTER: "Why didn't you come in?"

BALARAM: "All were listening to you. I didn't like to disturb you." The Master got into the carriage with his companions.

VIDYASAGAR (to M., softly): "Shall I pay the carriage hire?"

M: "Oh, don't bother, please. It is taken care of."

Vidyasagar and his friends bowed to Sri Ramakrishna, and the carriage started for
Dakshineswar. But the little group, with the venerable Vidyasagar at their head holding
the lighted candle, stood at the gate and gazed after the Master until he was out of sight.
