Master at Balaram's house

Around 8 AM, Sri Ramakrishna went as planned to Balaram Bose's house in Calcutta. It was the day of the Dolayatra. 

Ram, Manomohan, Rakhal, Nityagopal, and other devotees were with him. M., too, came, as bidden by the Master.

## Devotees in trance

The devotees and the Master sang and danced in a state of divine fervour. Several of them were in an ecstatic mood. Nityagopal's chest glowed with the upsurge of emotion,
and Rakhal lay on the floor in ecstasy, completely unconscious of the world. 

The Master put his hand on Rakhal's chest and said: "Peace. Be quiet." This was Rakhal's first experience of ecstasy. He lived with his father in Calcutta and now and then visited the Master at Dakshineswar. 

About this time he had studied a short while in Vidyasagar's school at Syampukur.

When the music was over, the devotees sat down for their meal. Balaram stood there humbly, like a servant. Nobody would have taken him for the master of the house. M.
was still a stranger to the devotees, having met only Narendra at Dakshineswar. 

A few days later M. visited the Master at Dakshineswar. It was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. The Master and he were sitting on the steps of the Śiva
temples. Looking at the temple of Radhakanta, across the courtyard, the Master went into an ecstatic mood.

Since his nephew Hriday's dismissal from the temple, Sri Ramakrishna had been living without an attendant. On account of his frequent spiritual moods he could hardly take
care of himself. The lack of an attendant caused him great inconvenience. 

## Bigotry condemned

Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Kāli, the Divine Mother of the Universe. He said: "Mother,
everyone says, 'My watch alone is right.' The Christians, the Brahmos, the Hindus, the
Mussalmans, all say, 'My religion alone is true.' But, Mother, the fact is that nobody's
watch is right. Who can truly understand Thee? But if a man prays to Thee with a
yearning heart, he can reach Thee, through Thy grace, by any path. Mother, show me
some time how the Christians pray to Thee in their churches. But Mother, what will
people say if I go in? Suppose they make a fuss! Suppose they don't allow me to enter
the Kāli temple again! Well then, show me the Christian worship from the door of the
church."
The mind's inability to comprehend God
Another day the Master was seated on the small couch in his room, with his usual
beaming countenance. M. arrived with Kalikrishna, who did not know where his friend M.
was taking him. He had only been told: "If you want to see a grog-shop, then come with
me. You will see a huge jar of wine there." M. related this to Sri Ramakrishna, who
103laughed about it. The Master said: "The bliss of worship and communion with God is the
true wine, the wine of ecstatic love. The goal of human life is to love God, Bhakti is the
one essential thing. To know God through jnāna and reasoning is extremely difficult."
Then the Master sang:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her....
The Master said, again: "The one goal of life is to cultivate love for God, the love that the
milkmaids, the milkmen, and the cowherd boys of Vrindāvan felt for Krishna. When
Krishna went away to Mathura, the cowherds roamed about weeping bitterly because of
their separation from Him."
Saying this the Master sang, with his eyes turned upward:
Just now I saw a youthful cowherd
With a young calf in his arms;
There he stood, by one hand holding
The branch of a young tree.
"Where are You, Brother Kanai?" he cried;
But "Kanai" scarcely could he utter;
"Ka" was as much as he could say.
He cried, "Where are You, Brother?"
And his eyes were filled with tears.
When M. heard this song of the Master's, laden with love, his eyes were moist with tears.
April 2, 1882
Master's visit to Keshab
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in the drawing-room of Keshab Chandra Sen's house in
Calcutta; it was five o'clock in the afternoon. When Keshab was told of his arrival, he
came to the drawing-room dressed to go out, for he was about to call on a sick friend.
Now he cancelled his plan. The Master said to him: "You have so many things to attend
to. Besides, you have to edit a newspaper. You have no time to come to Dakshineswar;
so I have come to see you. When I heard of your illness I vowed green coconut and
sugar to the Divine Mother for your recovery. I said to Her, 'Mother, if something
happens to Keshab, with whom shall I talk in Calcutta?' "
Sri Ramakrishna spoke to Pratap and the other Brahmo devotees. M. was seated near
by. Pointing to him, the Master said to Keshab: "Will you please ask him why he doesn't
come to Dakshineswar any more? He repeatedly tells me he is not attached to his wife
and children." M. had been paying visits to the Master for about a month; his absence
for a time from Dakshineswar called forth this remark. Sri Ramakrishna had asked M. to
write to him, if his coming were delayed.
104Pundit Samadhyayi was present. The Brahmo devotees introduced him to Sri
Ramakrishna as a scholar well versed in the Vedas and the other scriptures. The Master
said, "Yes, I can see inside him through his eyes, as one can see the objects in a room
through the glass door."
Trailokya sang. Suddenly the Master stood up and went into samādhi, repeating the
Mother's name. Coming down a little to the plane of sense consciousness, he danced
and sang:
I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,
As I repeat my Mother Kāli's name;
It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk!
First my guru gives molasses for the making of the Wine;
My longing is the ferment to transform it.
Knowledge, the maker of the Wine, prepares it for me then;
And when it is done, my mind imbibes it from the bottle of the
mantra,
Taking the Mother's name to make it pure.
Drink of this Wine, says Ramprasad, and the four fruits of life
are yours.
The Master looked at Keshab tenderly, as if Keshab were his very own. He seemed to
fear that Keshab might belong to someone else, that is to say, that he might become a
worldly person. Looking at him, the Master sang again:
We are afraid to speak, and yet we are afraid to keep still;
Our minds, O Radha, half believe that we are about to lose
you!
We tell you the secret that we know -
The secret whereby we ourselves, and others, with our help,
Have passed through many a time of peril;
Now it all depends on you.
Quoting the last part of the song, he said to Keshab: "That is to say, renounce
everything and call on God. He alone is real; all else is illusory. Without the realization of
God everything is futile. This is the great secret."
The Master sat down again and began to converse with the devotees. For a while he
listened to a piano recital, enjoying it like a child. Then he was taken to the inner
apartments, where he was served with refreshments and the ladies saluted him.
As the Master was leaving Keshab's house, the Brahmo devotees accompanied him
respectfully to his carriage.
Sunday, April 9, 1882
Sri Ramakrishna was seated with his devotees in the drawing-room of Prankrishna
Mukherji's house in Calcutta; it was between one and two o'clock in the afternoon. Since
105Colonel Viswanath4 lived in that neighbourhood, the Master intended to visit him before
going to see Keshab at the Lily Cottage. A number of neighbours and other friends of
Prankrishna had been invited to meet Sri Ramakrishna. They were all eager to hear his
words.
God and His glory & Dangers of worldly life
MASTER: "God and His glory. This universe is His glory. People see His glory and forget
everything. They do not seek God, whose glory is this world. All seek to enjoy 'woman
and gold'. But there is too much misery and worry in that. This world is like the whirlpool
of the Viśālākśi. Once a boat gets into it there is no hope of its rescue. Again, the world
is like a thorny bush: you have hardly freed yourself from one set of thorns before you
find yourself entangled in another. Once you enter a labyrinth you find it very difficult to
get out. Living in the world, a man becomes seared, as it were."
A DEVOTEE: "Then what is the way, sir?"
Prayer and holy company & Earnest longing
MASTER: "Prayer and the company of holy men. You cannot get rid of an ailment without
the help of a physician. But it is not enough to be in the company of religious people only
for a day. You should constantly seek it, for the disease has become chronic. Again, you
can't understand the pulse rightly unless you live with a physician. Moving with him
constantly, you learn to distinguish between the pulse of phlegm and the pulse of bile."
DEVOTEE: "What is the good of holy company?"
MASTER: "It begets yearning for God. It begets love of God. Nothing whatsoever is
achieved in spiritual life without yearning. By constant living in the company of holy
men, the soul becomes restless for God. This yearning is like the state of mind of a man
who has someone ill in the family. His mind is in a state of perpetual restlessness,
thinking how the sick person may be cured. Or again, one should feel a yearning for God
like the yearning of a man who has lost his job and is wandering from one office to
another in search of work. If he is rejected at a certain place which has no vacancy, he
goes there again the next day and inquires, 'Is there an vacancy today?'
"There is another way: earnestly praying to God. God is our very own. We should say to
Him: 'O God, what is Thy nature? Reveal Thyself to me. Thou must show Thyself to me;
for why else hast Thou created me?' Some Sikh devotees once said to me, 'God is full of
compassion.' I said: 'But why should we call Him compassionate? He is our Creator.
What is there to be wondered at if He is kind to us? Parents bring up their children. Do
you call that an act of kindness? They must act that way.' Therefore we should force our
demands on God. He is our Father and Mother, isn't He? If the son demands his
patrimony and gives up food and drink in order to enforce his demand, then the parents
hand his share over to him three years before the legal time. Or when the child demands
some pice from his mother, and says over and over again: 'Mother, give me a couple of
pice. I beg you on my knees!' - then the mother, seeing his earnestness, and unable to
bear it any more, tosses the money to him.
106"There is another benefit from holy company. It helps one cultivate discrimination
between the Real and the unreal. God alone is the Real, that is to say, the Eternal
Substance, and the world is unreal, that is to say, transitory. As soon as a man finds his
mind wandering away to the unreal, he should apply discrimination. The moment an
elephant stretches out its trunk to eat a plantain-tree in a neighbour's garden, it gets a
blow from the iron goad of the driver."
Explanation of evil
A NEIGHBOUR: "Why does a man have sinful tendencies?"
MASTER: "In God's creation there are all sorts of things. He has created bad men as well
as good men. It is He who gives us good tendencies, and it is He again who gives us evil
tendencies."
NEIGHBOUR: "In that case we aren't responsible for our sinful actions, are we?"
MASTER: "Sin begets its own result. This is God's law. Won't you burn our tongue if you
chew a chilli? In his youth Mathur6 led a rather fast life; so he suffered from various
diseases before his death.
"One may not realize this in youth. I have looked into the hearth in the kitchen of the
Kāli temple when logs are being burnt. At first the wet wood burns rather well. It doesn't
seem then that it contains much moisture. But when the wood is sufficiently burnt, all
the moisture runs back to one end. At last water squirts from the fuel and puts out the
fire.
"So one should be careful about anger, passion, and greed. Take, for instance, the case
of Hanuman. In a fit of anger he burnt Ceylon. At last he remembered that Sita was
living in the aśoka grove. Then he began to tremble lest the fire should injure her."
NEIGHHBOUR: "Why has God created wicked people?"
MASTER: "That is His will, His play. In His maya there exists avidyā as well as vidyā.
Darkness is needed too. It reveals all the more the glory of light. There is no doubt that
anger, lust, and greed are evils. Why, then, has God created them? In order to create
saints. A man becomes a saint by conquering the senses. Is there anything impossible
for a man who has subdued his passions? He can even realize God, through His grace.
Again, see how His whole play of creation is perpetuated through lust.
"Wicked people are needed too. At one time the tenants of an estate became unruly. The
landlord had to send Golak Choudhury, who was a ruffian. He was such a harsh
administrator that the tenants trembled at the very mention of his name.
"There is need of everything. Once Sita said
every house in Ayhodhya were a mansion! I
my dear,' said Rama, 'if all the houses were
(Laughter.) God has created all kinds of
to her Husband: 'Rama, it would be grand if
find many houses old and dilapidated.' 'But,
beautiful ones, what would the masons do?'
things. He has created good trees, and
107poisonous plants and weeds as well. Among the animals there are good, bad, and all
kinds of creatures - tigers, lions, snakes, and so on."
Washing away the heart's impurities with tears
NEIGHTBOUR: "Sir, is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of a
householder?"

MASTER: "Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company and pray
unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the mind are thus washed
away, one realizes God. The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a
magnet. The needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears
wash away the mud, which is nothing but lust, anger, greed, and other evil tendencies,
and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well. As soon as the mud is washed away,
the magnet attracts the needle, that is to say, man realizes God. Only the pure in heart
see God. A fever patient has an excess of the watery element in his system. What can
quinine do for him unless that is removed?
"Why shouldn't one realize God while living in the world? But, as I said, one must live in
holy company, pray to God, weeping for His grace, and now and then go into solitude.
Unless the plants on a foot-path are protected at first by fences, they are destroyed by
cattle."

## Need of a guru

NEIGHBOUR: "Then householders, too, will have the vision of God, won't they?"
MASTER: "Everybody will surely be liberated. But one should follow the instructions of
the guru; if one follows a devious path, one will suffer in trying to retrace one's steps. It
takes a long time to achieve liberation. A man may fail to obtain it in this life. Perhaps he
will realize God only after many births. Sages like Janaka performed worldly duties. They
performed them, bearing God in their minds, as a dancing-girl dances, keeping jars or
trays on her head. Haven't you seen how the women in northwest India walk, talking
and laughing while carrying water-pitchers on their beads?"
NEIGHBOUR: "You just referred to the instructions of the guru. How shall we find him?"
MASTER: "Anyone and everyone cannot be a guru. A huge timber floats on the water
and can carry animals as well. But a piece of worthless wood sinks, if a man sits on it,
and drowns him. Therefore in every age God incarnates Himself as the guru, to teach
humanity. Satchidananda alone is the guru.

"What is knowledge? And what is the nature of this ego? 'God alone is the Doer, and
none else' - that is knowledge. I am not the doer; I am a mere instrument in His hand.
Therefore I say: 'O Mother, Thou art the Operator and I am the machine. Thou art the
Indweller and I am the house. Thou art the Driver and I am the carriage. I move as
Thou movest me. I do as Thou makest me do. I speak as Thou makest me speak. Not I,
not I, but Thou, but Thou.' "

From Prankrishna's house the Master went to Colonel Viswanath's and from there to the
Lily Cottage.
