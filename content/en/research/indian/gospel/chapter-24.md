Wednesday, June 25, 1884

IT WAS THE DAY of the Rathyatra the Car Festival of the Hindus. 

At Ishan's invitation. Sri Ramakrishna went to his house in Calcutta. For some time the Master had had a desire
to meet Pundit Shashadhar. Tarkachudamani, who had been staying with one of Ishan's
neighbours. 

So it was decided that he would visit the pundit in the afternoon.

A few devotees, including Hazra, accompanied the Master to Ishan's house. Ishan had
invited one or two brahmin scholars and a devotee who followed the Tantrik method of
worship. Shrish and Ishan's other sons were also present.
The Master noticed that the Tantrik worshipper had a vermilion mark on his forehead,
and smilingly said, "I see he is branded."

After a while M. and Narendra arrived and bowed before Sri Ramakrishna. The Master
had previously informed M. that he would be at Ishan's house.

The Master joked about the delay in serving their meal. One of the scholars quoted a Sanskrit verse about the anxiety created in people's minds by the pangs of hunger.
Proceeding to explain the verse he said: "The study of philosophy is indeed edifying, but poetry is more fascinating than philosophy. People listening to good poems think of the study of philosophy-Vedānta, Nyaya, Samkhya, and so forth as dry and insipid. 

Again, music is more attractive than poetry. Music melts even a heart of stone. But a beautiful woman has an even greater attraction for a man's heart than music. Such a woman, passing by, diverts a man's attention from both poetry and music. But when a man feels the pangs of hunger, everything else poetry, music and woman appears as of no consequence. Thus, hunger is the most arresting thing."

The Master remarked with a smile, "The pundit is witty."

Soon Narendra began to sing. A few moments later the Master went upstairs for a little rest. M. and Shrish accompanied him. M. introduced Shrish to the Master, saying: "He is a scholar and a man of peaceful nature. We were fellow students in our boyhood. Now he is a lawyer."

MASTER: "It is a pity that such a man should practise law."

M: "Yes, sir. It was a mistake on his part."
MASTER: "I know a few lawyers. One of them shows me great respect. He is a
straightforward man. (To Shrish) What is your idea about the most essential thing in life?"

SHRISH: "God exists and He alone does everything. But the attributes we ascribe to Him are not the right ones. How can a man canceive of Him? His nature is infinite."
MASTER: "What need is there of your counting the number of trees and branches in an orchard? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Do that and be happy. The aim
of human birth is to love God. Realize that love and be at peace.

"Suppose you have entered a tavern for a drink. Is it necessary for you to know how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One glass is enough for you. What need is there of your knowing the infinite qualities of God? You may discriminate for millions of years about God's attributes and still you will not know them."
The Master remained silent a few minutes. A brahmin pundit came into the room. 


## Sufferings in the worldly life

MASTER (to M.): "There is no substance whatsoever in the worldly life. The members of
Ishan's family are good; so he has some peace here. Suppose his sons had been lewd,
disobedient, and addicted to drink and other vices. Then there would have been no end
to his troubles. One very seldom comes across such a religious family, in which all the
members are devoted to God. I have seen only two or three such families. Generally one
finds quarrels, misunderstanding, jealousy, and friction. Besides, there are disease,
grief, and poverty in the world. Seeing this condition, I prayed to the Divine Mother, 'O
Mother, turn my mind at once from the world to God.'
"Look at Narendra's troubles. His father is dead and the members of his family are
starving. He has been trying his utmost to secure a position, but he has not yet found
one. Just see how unsettled his mind is!
(To M.) "You used to come to Dakshineswar very frequently. But why have you become
such a rare visitor? Perhaps you have become particularly friendly with your wife. Is it
true? Why should I blame you? The influence of 'woman and gold' is everywhere.
Therefore I pray, 'O Divine Mother, please don't make me a worldly man if I am to be
born again in a human body.' "
BRĀHMIN SCHOLAR: "Why should you say that, sir? The scriptures extol the life of a
householder."
MASTER: "Yes, that is true. But it is very difficult to lead the true life of a householder.
(To M.) How wrong of us! They are singing, especially Narendra, and we have left the
room."
About four o'clock in the afternoon the Master left in a carriage for the house where
Pundit Shashadhar was staying. As soon as Sri Ramakrishna got into the carriage he
went into samādhi. His physical frame was very tender as a result of the austerities he
had undergone during the long years of his spiritual discipline and his constant
absorption in God-Consciousness.
500The Master would suffer from the slightest physical discomfort and even from the
vibration of worldly thoughts around him. Once Keshab Chandra Sen had said that Sri
Ramakrishna, Christ, and Sri Chaitanya belonged to a delicate species of humanity that
should be kept in a glass case and protected from the vulgar contact of the world.
It was the rainy season, and a fine drizzle of rain had made the road muddy. The sky
was overcast. The devotees followed the carriage on foot. As the carriage stopped in
front of the house, the host and his relatives welcomed the Master and took him upstairs
to the drawing-room. There the Master met the pundit.
Pundit Shashadhar
Pundit Shashadhar, a man of fair complexion and no longer young, had a string of
rudraksha beads around his neck. He was one of the renowned Sanskrit scholars of his
time-a pillar of orthodox Hinduism, which had reasserted itself after the first wave of
Christianity and Western culture had passed over Hindu society. His clear exposition of
the Hindu scriptures, his ringing sincerity, and, his stirring eloquence had brought back a
large number of the educated young Hindus of Bengal to the religion of their forefathers.
The pundit saluted the Master with reverence. Narendra, Rākhāl , Ram, Hazra, and M.,
who had come with the Master, seated themselves in the room as near the Master as
they could, anxious not to miss one of his words.
At the sight of the pundit the Master again went into samādhi. After a while, still
remaining in that state, he looked at the pundit and said with a smile, "Very well, very
well." Then, addressing the pundit, the Master said, "Tell me how you give lectures."
PUNDIT: "Sir, I try to explain the teachings of the Hindu scriptures."
Efficacy of bhakti for modern times
MASTER: "For the Kaliyuga the path of devotion described by Nārada is best. Where can
people find time now to perform their duties according to the scriptural injunctions?
Nowadays the decoctions of roots and herbs of the orthodox Hindu physicians cannot be
given to a fever patient. By the time that kind of medicine begins its slow process of
curing, the patient is done for. Therefore only a drastic medicine like the allopathic 'fever
mixture' is effective now. You may ask people to practise scriptural rites and rituals; but,
when prescribing the rituals, remove the 'head and tail'. I tell people not to bother about
the elaborate rituals of the sandhya as enjoined in the scriptures. I say that it will be
enough for them to repeat the Gayatri alone. If you must give instruction about
scriptural ceremonies, do so only to a very few, like Ishan.
Futility of lecturing
"You may deliver thousands of lectures, but they won't make the slightest impression on
worldly people. Can one drive a nail into a stone wall? The point of the nail will sooner
break than make a dent in the stone. What will you gain by striking the tough skin of the
crocodile with a sword? The sādhu's water-bowl, made from the shell of a bitter gourd,
may visit the four principal holy places of India with its owner, but it will still remain as
501bitter as ever. Your lectures are not helping worldly people very much; and you will
realize this by and by. The calf cannot stand on its legs all at once. Now it drops to the
ground and now it stands up. So it learns to stand finally on its legs and walk.
"You cannot distinguish a lover of God from a worldly person. It isn't your fault, of
course. When the first onrush of the gale shakes the trees, it is impossible to distinguish
one tree from another-the mango from the tamarind, for instance.
Rituals prepare the way for divine love
"Without having realized God one cannot give up rituals altogether. How long should one
practise the sandhya and other forms of ritualistic worship? As long as one does not shed
tears of joy at the name of God and feel a thrill in one's body. You will know that your
ritualistic worship has come to an end when your eyes become filled with tears as you
repeat 'Om Rāma'. Then you do not have to continue your sandhya or other rituals.
"When the fruit appears the blossom drops off. Love of God is the fruit, and rituals are
the blossom. When the daughter-in-law of the house becomes pregnant, she cannot do
much work. Her mother-in-law gradually lessens her duties in the house. When her time
arrives she does practically nothing. And after the child is born her only work is to play
with it. She doesn't do any household duties at all. The sandhya merges in the Gayatri,
the Gayatri in Om, and, Om in samādhi. It is like the sound of a bell: t-a-m. The yogi, by
following in the trail of the sound Om, gradually merges himself in the Supreme
Brahman. His sandhya and other ritualistic duties disappear in samādhi. Thus the duties
of the Jnāni come to an end."
As the Master talked of samādhi, he himself went into that state. His face radiated a
heavenly light. Bereft of outer consciousness, he could not utter another word. His gaze
was indrawn and transfixed in communion with the Self. After a long time the Master
began to recognize the world around him and said, like a child, "I shall have a drink of
water." Whenever after samādhi the Master asked for a drink of water, his devotees
knew that he was gradually becoming conscious of the outer world.
Still lingering in the state of ecstasy, he said to the Divine Mother: "O Mother, the other
day You showed me Pundit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar. Then I told You that I should like
to see another pundit, and so You have brought me here."
Looking at the pundit, he said: "My child, add a little more to your strength. Practise
spiritual discipline a few days more. You have hardly set your foot on the tree, yet you
expect to lay hold of a big cluster of fruit. But, of course, you are doing all this for the
welfare of others." With these words he bowed his head before the pundit.
The Master continued: "When I first heard about you, I inquired whether you were
merely erudite or whether you had discrimination and renunciation. A pundit who doesn't
know how to discriminate between the Real and the unreal is no pundit at all.
502Preacher with God's commission
"There is no harm in teaching others if the preacher has a commission from the Lord.
Nobody can confound a preacher who teaches people after having received the
command of God. Getting a ray of light from the goddess of learning, a man becomes so
powerful that before him big scholars seem mere earthworms.
"When the lamp is lighted the moths come in swarms. They don't have to be invited. In
the same way, the preacher who has a commission from God need not invite people to
hear him. He doesn't have to announce the time of his lectures. He possesses such
irresistible attraction that people come to him of their own accord. People of all classes,
even kings and aristocrats, gather around him. They say to him: 'Revered sir, what can
we offer you? Here are mangoes, sweets, money, shawls, and other things. What will
you be pleased to accept?' In that case I say to them: 'Go away. I don't care, for these. I
don't want anything.'
"Does the magnet say to the iron, 'Come near me?' That is not necessary. Because of
the attraction of the magnet, the iron rushes to it.
Divine wisdom is inexhaustible
"Such a preacher may not be a scholarly person, but don't conclude from that that he
has any lack of wisdom. Does book-learning make one wise? He who has a commission
from God never runs short of wisdom. That wisdom comes from God; it is inexhaustible.
At Kamarpukur I have seen people measuring grain. It lies in a heap. One man keeps
pushing grain from the heap toward another man, who weighs it on a scales. So the man
who weighs doesn't run short of grain. It is the same with the preacher who has received
a commission from God. As he teaches people, the Divine Mother Herself supplies him
with fresh knowledge from behind. That knowledge never comes to an end.
"Can a preacher ever lack knowledge if but once he is favoured with a benign glance
from the Divine Mother? Therefore I ask you whether you have received any commission
from God."
HAZRA: "Oh yes, he must have it. (To the pundit) Isn't it true, sir?"
PUNDIT: "Commission? No, sir, I am afraid I haven't received any such thing."
HOST: "He may not have received the commission, but he preaches from a sense of
duty."
MASTER: "What will a man accomplish by mere lectures without the commission from
God? Once a Brahmo preacher said in the course of his sermon, 'Friends, how much I
used to drink!' and so on. Hearing this the people began to whisper among themselves:
'What is this fool saying? He used to drink!' Now these words produced a very
unfavourable effect. This shows that preaching cannot bring a good result unless it
comes from a good man.
503"A high government official from Barisal once said to me, 'Sir, if you begin the work of
preaching, I too shall gird my loins.' I told him the story of people's dirtying the bank of
the Haldārpukur and of its being stopped only when a constable, armed with authority
from the government, put up a notice prohibiting it.
"So I say, a worthless man may talk his head off preaching, and yet he will produce no
effect. But people will listen to him if he is armed with a badge of authority from God.
One cannot teach others without the commission from God. A teacher of men must have
great power. There's many a Hanumanpuri in Calcutta. It is with them that you will
have to wrestle. (Pointing to the people assembled there) These are mere sheep!
"Chaitanyadeva was an Incarnation of God. How little is left of what he accomplished-not
to speak of a lecturer who preaches without authority from God! What good will a
lecturer do?
Master exhorts the pundit to cultivate divine love
"Therefore I say to you, dive deep in God-Consciousness."
Saying this, the Master began to sing in an ecstasy of love for God:
Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty;
If you descend to the uttermost depths,
There you will find the gem of Love. . . .
The Master continued: "One does not die if one sinks in this Ocean. This is the Ocean of
Immortality. Once I said to Narendra: 'God is the Ocean of Bliss. Tell me if you want to
plunge into It. Just imagine there is some syrup in a cup and that you have become a
fly. Now tell me where you will sit to sip the syrup.' Narendra answered: 'I will, sit on the
edge of the cup and stretch out my neck to drink, because I am sure to die if I go far
into the cup.' Then I said to him: 'But my child, this is the Ocean of Satchidananda.
There is no fear of death in it. This is the Ocean of Immortality. Only ignorant people say
that one should not have an excess of devotion and divine love. How foolish! Can there
be any excess of divine love?'
(To the pundit) "Therefore I say to you, dive into the Ocean of Satchidananda. Nothing
will ever worry you if you but realize God. Then you will get His commission to teach
people.
Many paths to realize God
"There are innumerable pathways leading to the Ocean of Immortality. The essential
thing is to reach the Ocean. It doesn't matter which path you follow. Imagine that there
is a reservoir containing the Elixir of Immortality. You will be immortal if a few drops of
the Elixir somehow get into your mouth. You may get into the reservoir either by
jumping into it, or by being pushed into it from behind, or by slowly walking down the
steps. The effect is one and the same. You will become immortal by tasting a drop of
that Elixir.
504Three yogas explained by Master
"Innumerable are the ways that lead to God. There are the paths of jnāna, of karma,
and of bhakti. If you are sincere, you will attain God in the end, whichever path you
follow. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of yoga: jnanayoga, karma yoga, and
bhaktiyoga.
"What is jnanayoga? The Jnāni seeks to realize Brahman. He discriminates, saying, 'Not
this, not this'. He discriminates, saying, 'Brahman is real and the universe illusory.' He
discriminates between the Real and the unreal. As he comes to the end of discrimination,
he goes into samādhi and attains the Knowledge of Brahman.
"What is karmayoga? Its aim is to fix one's mind on God by means of work. That is what
you are teaching. It consists of breath-control, concentration, meditation, and so on,
done in a spirit of detachment. If a householder performs his duties in the world in a
spirit of detachment, surrendering the results to God and with devotion to God in his
heart, he too may be said to practise karmayoga. Further, if a person performs worship,
japa, and other forms of devotion, surrendering the results to God, he may be said to
practise karmayoga. Attainment of God alone is the aim of karmayoga.
"What is bhaktiyoga? It is to keep the mind on God by chanting His name and glories.
For the Kaliyuga the path of devotion is easiest. This is indeed the path for this age.
Difficulties of the paths of jnāna and karma
"The path of karma is very difficult. First of all, as I have just said, where will one find
the time for it nowadays? Where is the time for a man to perform his duties as enjoined
in the scriptures? Man's life is short in this age. Further, it is extremely difficult to
perform one's duties in a spirit of detachment, without craving the result. One cannot
work in such a spirit without first having realized God. Attachment to the result somehow
enters the mind, though you may not be aware of it.
"To follow jnanayoga in this age is also very difficult. First, a man's life depends entirely
on food. Second, he has a short span of life. Third, he can by no means get rid of body-
consciousness; and the Knowledge of Brahman is impossible without the destruction of
body-consciousness. The Jnāni says: 'I am Brahman; I am not the body. I am beyond
hunger and thirst, disease and grief, birth and death, pleasure and pain.' How can you
be a Jnāni if you are conscious of disease, grief, pain, pleasure, and the like? A thorn
enters your flesh, blood flow from the wound, and you suffer very badly from the pain;
but nevertheless, if you are a Jnāni you must be able to say: 'Why, there is no thorn in
my flesh at all. Nothing is the matter with me'
"Therefore bhaktiyoga is prescribed for this age. By following this path one comes to God
more easily than by following the others. One can undoubtedly, reach God by following
the paths of jnāna and karma, but they are very difficult paths.
God fulfils all desires of His devotees
"Bhaktiyoga is the religion for this age. But that does not mean that the lover of God will
reach one goal and the philosopher and worker another. It means that if a person seeks
505the Knowledge of Brahman he can attain It by following the path of bhakti, too. God,
who loves His devotee, can give him the Knowledge of Brahman if He so desires.
"But the bhakta wants to realize the Personal God endowed with form and talk to Him.
He seldom seeks the Knowledge of Brahman. But God, who does everything at His
pleasure, can make His devotee the heir to His infinite glories if it pleases Him. He gives
His devotee both the Love of God and the Knowledge of Brahman. If one is able
somehow to reach Calcutta, one can see the Maidan and the museum and other places
too. The thing is how to reach Calcutta.
"By realizing the Divine Mother of the Universe, you will get Knowledge as well as
Devotion. You will get both. In bhava samādhi you will see the form of God, and in
nirvikalpa samādhi you will realize Brahman, the Absolute Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. In
nirvikalpa samādhi ego, name, and form do not exist.
Devotee's prayer to God
"A lover of God prays to the Divine Mother: 'O Mother, I am very much afraid of selfish
actions. Such actions have desires behind them, and if I perform them I shall have to
reap their fruit. But it is very difficult to work in a detached spirit. I shall certainly forget
Thee, O Mother, if I involve myself in selfish actions. Therefore I have no use for them.
May my actions, O Divine Mother, be fewer every day till I attain Thee. May I perform,
without attachment to the results, only what action is absolutely necessary for me. May I
have great love for Thee as I go on with my few duties. May I not entangle myself in
new work so long as I do not realize Thee. But I shall perform it if I receive Thy
command. Otherwise not.' "
About pilgrimage
PUNDIT: "How far did you go in visiting the sacred places?"
MASTER: "Oh, I visited a few places. (With a smile) But Hazra went farther and also
climbed higher. He visited Hrishikesh, but I didn't go so far or so high.
"You must pave noticed kites and vultures soaring very high in the sky; but their eyes
are always fixed on the charnel-pits. Do you know the meaning of 'charnel-pits'? It is
'woman and gold'.
"What is the use of making pilgrimages if you can attain love of God remaining where
you are? I have been to Benares and noticed the same trees there as here. The same
green tamarind-leaves!
"Pilgrimage becomes futile if it does not enable you to attain love of God. Love of God is
the one essential and necessary thing. Do you know the meaning of 'kites and vultures'?
There are many people who talk big and who say that they have performed most of the
duties enjoined in the scriptures. But with all that their minds are engrossed in
worldliness and deeply preoccupied with money, riches, name, fame, creature comforts,
and such things."
506PUNDIT: "It is true, sir. Going on a pilgrimage is like seeking diamonds and gems, while
discarding the precious stone that is worn by Narayana Himself on His breast."
MASTER: "I want you to remember this. You may impart thousands of instructions to
people, but they will not bear fruit except in proper time. On going to bed, a child said to
his mother, 'Mother, please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' The mother said:
'Don't worry about it, my child. That call will wake you up itself.' (All laugh.) One feels
yearning for God at the proper time.
Three kinds of teachers
"There are three classes of physicians. The physicians of one class feel the patient's
pulse and go away, merely prescribing medicine. As they leave the room they simply ask
the patient to take the medicine. They are the poorest class of physicians. Likewise,
there are teachers who only give instruction, but do not stop to see whether their
teachings have produced a good or bad effect. They do not think at all about the disciple.
"There are physicians of another class, who prescribe medicine and ask the patient to
take it. If the patient is unwilling to follow their directions, they reason with him. They
are the mediocre physicians. Likewise, there are mediocre teachers. They give
instruction to the student and, further, try to persuade him in various ways to follow the
instruction.
"Lastly, there are the physicians of the highest class. If the patient does
not respond to their gentle persuasion, they even exert force upon him. If necessary,
they press their knees on the patient's chest and force the medicine down his throat.
Likewise, there are teachers of the highest class, who even exert force to direct the mind
of the pupil toward God."
PUNDIT: Sir, if there are such superior teachers as you have described, then why should
you say that one does not get the Knowledge of God until the right time comes?"
MASTER: "You are right. But what will the physician do if the medicine runs out of the
patient's mouth and doesn't reach his stomach? In such a case even the best physician
can't do anything.
"The teacher should judge the fitness of the student before giving him instruction. But
you don't discriminate in your instruction. When a young man comes to me for
instruction, first of all I ask him about his relatives at home. Suppose he has lost his
father; suppose his father has left some debts for him. How can such a person direct his
mind to God? Are you listening to me?"
PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. I am paying attention to every word."
MASTER: "One day some Sikh soldiers came to the temple garden at Dakshineswar. I
met them in front of the Kāli temple. One of them referred to God as very
compassionate. 'Indeed!' I said. 'Is that true? But how do you know?' He answered,
507'Because, sir, God gives us food and takes every care of us.' I said: 'Why should that
surprise you? God is the Father of us all. Who will look after the child if the father
doesn't? Do you mean to say that the people of the neighbouring village should look
after the child?"
NARENDRA: "Then shouldn't we call God kind?"
MASTER: "Have I forbidden you to? What I mean is that God is our very own. He is not a
stranger to us."
PUNDIT: "Priceless words!"
MASTER (to Narendra): "I listened to your singing, but I didn't enjoy it. So I left the
room. Your mind is now set on seeking a job, and therefore your song sounded dull."
Narendra flushed. He felt ashamed of himself and remained silent.
The Master asked for a drink of water. A glass of water had been placed near him, but he
could not take it. He asked for some fresh water. Later it was found that a man of
immoral character had touched the first glass.
PUNDIT (to Hazra): "You live in his company day and night. You must be very happy."
MASTER (with a smile): "This is indeed a great occasion for me. Today I have seen the
crescent moon of the second day of the bright fortnight. (All laugh.) Do you know why I
referred to the moon of the second day? Sita once said to Ravana, 'You are the full moon
and Rāma is the crescent moon of the second day of the bright fortnight.' Ravana did not
understand the meaning of these words. He thought Sita was flattering him and became
exceedingly happy. But Sita meant that Ravana had reached the fullest limit of his power
and prosperity, and that thenceforth he would wane like the full moon. Rāma, on the
other hand, was like the moon of the second day. He would wax day by day."
The Master was about to take his leave. The pundit and his friends bowed low before
him.
It was not yet dusk, and Sri Ramakrishna returned to Ishan's house with the devotees.
The Master took his seat in the drawing-room with Ishan and his sons, a pundit, and a
few devotees.
MASTER (smiling to Ishan): "I said to Pundit Shashadhar: 'You have hardly set your foot
on the tree, and yet you aspire to lay hold of a big bunch of fruit. First of all practise
some spiritual discipline. Then you may teach others.' "
ISHAN: "Every preacher thinks that he enlightens others. The glowworm also may think
that it illumines the world. Imagining this to be the glow–worm's feeling, someone said
to it: 'O glow–worm, how can you bring light to the world? You only reveal the intensity
of the darkness.' "
508MASTER (with a smile): "But Shashadhar is not just a scholar. He also has a little
discrimination and dispassion."
A pundit who was present said to Sri Ramakrishna, "You are indeed a great soul."
MASTER: "You may say that about sages like Nārada, Prahlada, or Sukadeva. I am like
your son.
"Of course, in one sense your words are true. It is said that in one respect the devotee
of God is greater than God Himself, because he carries God in his heart. (All rejoice.) It
is said in the Vaishnava books: 'A devotee regards himself as a higher, and God as a
lower, being.' Yaśoda, the mother of Krishna, was about to fetter Krishna, who was God
Incarnate, with chains. She believed that no one but herself could take care of Krishna.
"Sometimes God acts as the magnet and the devotee as the needle. God attracts the
devotee to Himself. Again, sometimes the devotee acts as the magnet and God as the
needle. Such is the attraction of the devotee that God comes to him, unable to resist his
love."
The Master was about to leave for Dakshineswar. Ishan and the other devotees stood
around him while he gave Ishan various words of advice.
Advice to householders
MASTER: "A devotee who can call on God while living a householder's life is a hero
indeed. God thinks: 'He who has renounced the world for My sake will surely pray to Me.
He must serve Me. Is there anything very remarkable about it? People will cry shame on
him if he fails to do so. But he is blessed indeed who prays to Me in the midst of his
worldly duties. He is trying to find Me, overcoming a great obstacle-pushing away, as it
were, a huge block of stone weighing a ton. Such a man is a real hero.' "
PUNDIT: "You are right, sir. The scripture says the same thing. There is in the
Mahabharata the story of the 'pious hunter' and the 'chaste woman'. Once a hermit was
disturbed in his meditation by a crow. When he cast an angry glance at the bird, it was
reduced to ashes. The hermit said to himself: 'I have destroyed the crow by a mere
glance. I must have made great progress in spiritual life.' One day he went to a woman's
house to beg his food. She was devoted to her husband and served him day and night;
she provided him with water to wash his feet and even dried them with her hair. When
the hermit knocked at her door for alms, she was serving her husband and could not
open the door at once. The hermit, in a fit of anger, began to curse her. The chaste
woman answered from the inner apartments: 'I am not your crow. Wait a few minutes,
sir. After finishing my service to my husband I shall give you my attention.' The hermit
was very much surprised to find that this simple woman was aware of his having burnt
the crow to ashes. He wanted her to give him spiritual instruction. At her bidding he
went to the 'pious hunter' at Benares. This hunter sold meat, but he also served his
parents day and night as embodiments of God. The hermit said to himself in utter
amazement: 'Why, he is a butcher and a worldly man! How can he give me the
509Knowledge of Brahman?' But the hunter was a knower of Brahman and had acquired
divine knowledge through the performance of his worldly duties. The hermit was
illumined by the instruction of the 'pious hunter'."
The Master was about to take his leave. He was standing at the door of the next house,
where Ishan's father-in-law lived. Ishan and the other devotees stood by the Master.
They were waiting to bid him good-bye. Sri Ramakrishna said to Ishan: "Live in the
world like an ant. The world contains a mixture of truth and untruth, sugar and sand. Be
an ant and take the sugar.
"Again, the world is a mixture of milk and water, the bliss of God-Consciousness and the
pleasure of sense-enjoyment. Be a swan and drink the milk, leaving the water aside.
"Live in the world like a waterfowl. The water clings to the bird, but the bird shakes it
off. Live in the world like a mudfish. The fish lives in the mud, but its skin is always
bright and shiny.
"The world is indeed a mixture of truth and make-believe. Discard the make-believe and
take the truth."
Sri Ramakrishna got into the carriage and left for Dakshineswar.

510Chapter 25
ADVICE TO PUNDIT SHASHADHAR
Monday, June 30, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA was in his room, sitting on a mat spread on the floor. Pundit
Shashadhar and a few devotees were with him on the mat, and the rest sat on the bare
floor. Surendra, Baburam, M., Harish, Lātu, Hazra, and others were present. It was
about four o'clock in the afternoon.
Sri Ramakrishna had met Pundit Shashadhar six days before in Calcutta, and now the
pundit had come to Dakshineswar to visit the Master. Bhudar Chattopadhyaya and his
elder brother, the pundit's hosts, were with him.
Nature of Brahman
The pundit was a follower of the path of jnāna. The Master was explaining this path to
him. He said: "Nityā and Lila are the two aspects of one and the same Reality. He who is
the Indivisible Satchidananda has assumed different forms for the sake of His Lila." As
he described the nature of the Ultimate Reality the Master every now and then became
unconscious in samādhi. While he talked he was intoxicated with spiritual fervour. He
said to the pundit: "My dear sir, Brahman is immutalble and immovable, like Mount
Sumeru. But He who is 'immovable' can also 'move'."
Glories of Kāli
The Master was in ecstasy. He began to sing in his melodious voice:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. . . .
He went on:
Is Mother merely a simple woman, born as others are born?
Only by chanting Her holy name
Does Śiva survive the deadly poison.
She it is who creates the worlds, She who preserves and
destroys,
With a mere wink of Her wondrous eyes;
She holds the universe in Her womb.
Seeking a shelter at Her feet, the gods themselves feel safe;
And Mahadeva, God of Gods,
Lies prostrate underneath Her feet.
Again he sang:
Is Mother only Śiva's wife? To Her must needs bow down
The all-destroying King of Death!
511Naked She roams about the world, slaying Her demon foes,
Or stands erect on Śiva's breast.
Her feet upon Her Husband's form! What a strange wife She
makes!
My Mother's play, declares Prasad, shatters all rules and laws:
Strive hard for purity, O mind,
And understand my Mother's ways.
And again:
I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,
As I repeat my Mother Kāli's name;
It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk! . . .
And again:
Can everyone have the vision of Syama? Is Kāli's treasure for
everyone?
Oh, what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true!
Even with all His penances, rarely does Śiva Himself behold
The mind-bewitching sight of Mother Syama's crimson feet.
To him who meditates on Her the riches of heaven are poor
indeed;
If Syama casts Her glance on him, he swims in Eternal Bliss.
The prince of yogis, the king of the gods, meditate on Her feet
in vain
Yet worthless kamalakanta yearns for the Mother's blessed feet!
The Master's ecstatic mood gradually relaxed. He stopped singing and sat in silence.
After a while he got up and sat on the small couch.
Pundit Shashadhar was charmed with his singing. Very humbly he said to Sri
Ramakrishna, "Are you going to sing anymore?"
A little later the Master sang again:
High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring
like a kite,
When came a blast of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly
toward the earth. . . .
Then he sang:
Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood;
From One who knows it well, I have learnt the secret of bhava.
A man has come to me from a country where there is no night,
And now I cannot distinguish day from night any longer;
Rituals and devotions have all grown profitless for me.
My sleep is broken; how can I slumber any more?
For now I am wide awake in the sleeplessness of yoga.
O Divine Mother, made one with Thee in yoga-sleep at last,
My slumber I have lulled asleep for evermore.
512I bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation;
Knowing the secret that Kāli is one with the highest Brahman,
I have discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin.
Sri Ramakrishna continued:
I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother;
Am I afraid of Death any more?
Unto the tuft of hair on my head.
Is tied the almighty mantra, Mother Kāli's name.
My body I have sold in the market-place of the world
And with it have bought Sri Durga's name.
As Sri Ramakrishna sang the line, "And with it have bought Sri Durga's name", the tears
flowed from Pundit Shashadhar's eyes. The Master went on with the song:
Deep within my heart I have planted the name of Kāli,
The Wish-fulfilling Tree of heaven;
When Yama, King of Death, appears,
To him I shall open my heart and show it growing there.
I have cast out from me my six unflagging foes;4
Ready am I to sail life's sea,
Crying, "To Durga, victory!"
Again he sang:
Dwell, O mind, within yourself;
Enter no other's home.
If you but seek there, you will find
All you are searching for. . . .
And again:
Though I am never loath to grant salvation,
I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.
Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;
He is adored by men;
He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .
Mere study of scriptures is futile
The pundit had studied the Vedas and the other scriptures. He loved to discuss
philosophy. The Master, seated on the couch, cast his benign look on the pundit and
gave him counsel through parables.
MASTER (to the pundit): "There are many scriptures like the Vedas. But one cannot
realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline. 'God cannot be found in the six
systems, the Vedas, or the Tantra.'
"But one should learn the contents of the scriptures and then act according to their
injunctions. A man lost a letter. He couldn't remember where he had left it. He began to
513search for it with a lamp. After two or three people had searched, the letter was at last
found. The message in the letter was: 'Please send us five seers of sandesh and a piece
of wearing-cloth.' The man read it and then threw the letter away. There was no further
need of it; now all he had to do was to buy the five seers of sandesh and the piece of
cloth.
Reading, hearing, and seeing
"Better than reading is hearing, and better than hearing is seeing. One understands the
scriptures better by hearing them from the lips of the guru or of a holy man. Then one
doesn't have to think about their non-essential part.
Hanuman said: 'Brother, I don't know much about the phase of the moon or the position
of the stars. I just contemplate Rāma.'
"But seeing is far better than hearing. Then all doubts disappear. It is true that many
things are recorded in the scriptures; but all these are useless without the direct
realization of God, without devotion to His Lotus Feet, without purity of heart. The
almanac forecasts the rainfall of the year. But not a drop of water will you get by
squeezing the almanac. No, not even one drop.
"How long should one reason about the texts of the scriptures? So long as one does not
have direct realization of God. How long does the bee buzz about? As long as it is not
sitting on a flower. No sooner does it light on a flower and begin to sip honey than it
keeps quiet.
"But you must remember another thing. One may talk even after the realization of God.
But then one talks only of God and of Divine Bliss. It is like a drunkard's crying, 'Victory
to the Divine Mother!' He can hardly say anything else on account of his drunkenness.
You can notice, too, that a bee makes an indistinct humming sound after having sipped
the honey from a flower.
The nature of jnanis and vijnanis
"The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not this'.
Reasoning in this way, he at last comes to a state of Bliss, and that is Brahman. What is
the nature of a Jnāni? He behaves according to scriptural injunctions.
"Once I was taken to Chanak and saw some sādhus there. Several of them were sewing.
(All laugh.) At the sight of us they threw aside their sewing. They sat straight, crossing
their legs, and conversed with us. (All laugh.)
"But jnanis will not talk about spiritual things without being asked. They will inquire, at
first, about such things as your health and your family.
"But the nature of the vijnāni is different. He is unconcerned about anything. Perhaps he
carries his wearing-cloth loose under his arm, like a child; or perhaps the cloth has
dropped from his body altogether.
514"The man who knows that God exists is called a Jnāni. A Jnāni is like one who knows
beyond a doubt that a log of wood contains fire. But a vijnāni is he who lights the log,
cooks over the fire, and is nourished by the food. The eight fetters have fallen from the
vijnāni. He may keep merely the appearance of lust, anger, and the rest."
PUNDIT: "The knots of his heart are cut asunder; all his doubts are destroyed."
MASTER: "Yes. Once a ship sailed into the ocean. Suddenly its iron joints, nails, and
screws fell out. The ship was passing a magnetic hill, and so all its iron was loosened.
"I used to go to Krishnakishore's house. Once, when I was there, he said to me, 'Why do
you chew betel-leaf?' I said: 'It is my sweet pleasure. I shall chew betel-leaf, look at my
face in the mirror, and dance naked among a thousand girls.' Krishnakishore's wife
scolded him and said: 'What have you said to Ramakrishna? You don't know how to talk
to people.'
"In this state, passions like lust and anger are burnt up, though nothing happens to the
physical body. It looks just like any other body; but the inside is all hollow and pure."
A DEVOTEE: "Does the body remain even after the realization of God?"
MASTER: "The body survives with some so that they may work out their prarabdha
karma or work for the welfare of others. By bathing in the Ganges a man gets rid of his
sin and attains liberation. But if he happens to be blind, he doesn't get rid of his
blindness. Of course, he escapes future births, which would otherwise be necessary for
reaping the results of his past sinful karma. His present body remains alive as long as its
momentum7 is not exhausted; but future births are no longer possible. The wheel moves
as long as the impulse that has set it in motion lasts. Then it comes to a stop. In the
case of such a person, passions like lust and anger are burnt up. Only the body remains
alive to perform a few actions."
PUNDIT: "That is called samskara."
The nature of jnanis and vijnanis
MASTER: "The vijnāni always sees God. That is why he is so indifferent about the world.
He sees God even with his eyes open. Sometimes he comes down to the Lila from the
Nitya, and sometimes he goes up to the Nitya from the Lila."
PUNDIT: "I don't understand that."
MASTER: "The Jnāni reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', and at
last reaches the Eternal and Indivisible Satchidananda. He reasons in this manner:
'Brahman is not the living beings; It is neither the universe nor the twenty-four cosmic
principles.' As a result of such reasoning he attains the Absolute. Then he realizes that it
is the Absolute that has become all this-the universe, its living beings, and the twenty-
four cosmic principles.
515"Milk sets into curd, and the curd is churned into butter. After extracting the butter one
realizes that butter is not essentially different from buttermilk and buttermilk not
essentially different from butter. The bark of a tree goes with the pith and the pith goes
with the bark."
PUNDIT (smiling, to Bhudar): "Did you understand that? It is very difficult."
All-embracing realization of the vijnāni
MASTER: "If there is butter, there must be buttermilk also. If you think of butter, you
must also think of buttermilk along with it; for there cannot be any butter without
buttermilk. Just so, if you accept the Nitya, you must also accept the Lila. It is the
process of negation and affirmation. You realize the Nitya by negating the Lila. Then you
affirm the Lila, seeing in it the manifestation of the Nitya. One attains this state after
realizing Reality in both aspects: Personal and Impersonal. The Personal is the
embodiment of Chit, Consciousness; and the Impersonal is the Indivisible
Satchidananda.
"Brahman alone has become everything. Therefore to be vijnāni this world is a 'mansion
of myrth'. But to the Jnāni it is a 'framework of illusion'. Ramprasad described the world
as a 'framework of illusion'. Another man said to him by way of retort:
This very world is a mansion of myrth;
Here I can eat, here drink and make merry.
O physician, you are a fool!
You see only the surface of things.
Janaka's might was unsurpassed;
What did he lack of the world or the Spirit?
Holding to one as well as the other,
He drank his milk from a brimming cup!
"The vijnāni enjoys the bliss of God in a richer way. Some have heard of milk, some
have seen it, and some have drunk it. The vijnāni has drunk milk, enjoyed it, and been
nourished by it."
The Master remained silent a few moments and then asked Pundit Shashadhar to have a
smoke. The Pundit went to the south east verandah to smoke. Soon he came back to the
room and sat on the floor with the devotees. Seated on the small couch, the Master
continued the conversation.
MASTER (to the Pundit): "Let me tell you something. There are three kinds of Ānanda,
joy: the joy of worldly enjoyment, the joy of worship, and the Joy of Brahman. The joy
of worldly enjoyment is the joy of 'woman and gold', which people always enjoy. The joy
of worship one enjoys while chanting the name and glories of God. And the Joy of
Brahman is the joy of God-vision. After experiencing the joy of God-vision the rishis of
olden times went beyond all rules and conventions.
516Three states of God-Consciousness
"Chaitanyadeva used to experience three spiritual states: the inmost, the semi-
conscious, and the conscious. In the inmost state he would see God and go into
samādhi. He would be in the state of jada samādhi. In the semi-conscious state he
would be partially conscious of the outer world. In the conscious state he could sing the
name and glories of God."
HAZRA (to the Pundit): "So your doubts are now solved."
Samādhi described
MASTER (to the Pundit): "What is samādhi? It is the complete merging of the mind in
God-Consciousness. The Jnāni experiences jada samādhi, in which no trace of 'I' is left.
The samādhi attained through the path of bhakti is called 'chetana samādhi'. In this
samādhi there remains the conciousness of 'I' ― the 'I' of the servant-and-Master
relationship, of the lover-and-Beloved relationship, of the enjoyer-and-Food relationship.
God is the Master; the devotee is the servant. God is the beloved; the devotee is the
lover. God is the Food, and the devotee is the enjoyer. 'I don't want to be sugar. I want
to eat it.' "
PUNDIT: "What will happen if God dissolves all of the 'I', if He changes the enjoyer
himself into sugar?"
MASTER (smiling): "Come, come! Tell me what is in your mind. But don't the scriptures
mention Nārada, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda, and Sanatkumara?"
PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. They do."
MASTER: "Though they were jnanis, yet they kept the 'I' of the bhakta. Haven't you read
the Bhagavata?"
PUNDIT: "I have read only part of it, not the whole."
MASTER: "Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to the words of His
devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you desire from Him."
PUNDIT: "I haven't thought deeply about these things before. But now I understand."
MASTER: "God keeps a little of 'I' in His devotee even after giving him the Knowledge of
Brahman. That 'I' is the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnāni'. Through that 'I' the
devotee enjoys the infinite play of God.
"The pestle was almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left. That fell into the
underbrush and brought about the destruction of the lunar race, the race of the Yadus.
The vijnāni retains the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnāni', in order to taste the Bliss of
God and teach people.
517"The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do you know their
attitude? It was this: 'Let me somehow get my own salvation; who cares for others?' A
hollow piece of drift-wood somehow manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on
it. But Nārada and sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to
the other shore but can carry many animals and other creatures as well. A steamship
itself crosses the ocean and also carries people across.
The vijnāni is fearless and joyous
"Teachers like Nārada belong to the class of the vijnāni. They were much more
courageous than the other rishis. They are like an expert satrancha-player. You must
have noticed how he shouts, as he throws the dice: 'What do I want? Six? No, five! Here
is five!' And every time he throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a
clever player! And while playing he even twirls his moustaches.
"A mere Jnāni trembles with fear. He is like an amateur satrancha-player. He is anxious
to move his pieces somehow to the safety zone, where they won't be overtaken by his
opponent. But a vijnāni isn't afraid of anything. He has realized both aspects of God:
Personal and Impersonal. He has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God.
"It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through contemplation. And it
is also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the Relative, without dissolving it in the
Absolute.
"A mere Jnāni is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: 'It is not this, not
this. The world is like a dream.' But I have 'raised both my hands'. Therefore I accept
everything.
Parable of the weaver woman
"Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The weaver, who had
been spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very happy to see her friend and said to
her: 'Friend, I can't tell you how happy I am to see you. Let me get you some
refreshments.' She left the room. The woman looked at the threads of different colours
and was tempted. She hid a bundle of thread under one arm. The weaver returned
presently with the refreshments and began to feed her guest with great enthusiasm. But,
looking at the thread, she realized that her friend had taken a bundle. Hitting upon a
plan to get it back, she said: 'Friend, it is so long since I have seen you. This is a day of
great joy for me. I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.' The friend said,
'Sister, I am feeling very happy too.' So the two friends began to dance together. When
the weaver saw that her friend danced without raising her hands, she said: 'Friend, let
us dance with both hands raised. This is a day of great joy.' But the guest pressed one
arm to her side and danced raising only the other. The weaver said: 'How is this, friend?
Why should you dance with only one hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands.
Look at me. See how I dance with both hands raised.' But the guest still pressed one
arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and said with a smile, 'This is all
I know of dancing.' "
518The Master continued: "I don't press my arm to my side. Both my hands are free. I am
not afraid of anything. I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the
Relative.
The two kinds of ego
"I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realize God without renouncing the
ego. He said, 'Sir, in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together.'
Thereupon I said to him: 'I am asking you to give up the "unripe ego", the "wicked ego".
But there is no harm in the "ripe ego", the "child ego", the "servant ego", the "ego of
Knowledge".'
"The worldly man's ego, the 'ignorant ego', the 'unripe ego', is like a thick stick. It
divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda. But the 'servant ego', the
'child ego', the 'ego of Knowledge', is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there
is only one expanse of water. The dividing line makes it appear that the water has two
parts, but one clearly sees that in reality there is only one expanse of water.
"Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach people. God keeps in
many people the 'ego of a Jnāni' or the 'ego of a bhakta' even after they have attained
Brahmajnana. Hanuman, after realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal
aspect, cherished toward God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rāma: 'O
Rāma, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I
think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And sometimes, Rāma, when I
contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are I.'
"Yaśoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha.
Radha saw Yaśoda's suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Śakti, which was
her real nature. She said to Yaśoda: 'Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I
am ChitŚakti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me: Yaśoda said: 'I don't want
Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this: that I may see the form of Gopala in my
meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna's devotees; that I may
always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God's name and glories.'
"Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them
to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they
all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six
celestial splendours. But they did not like it. They said to Krishna: 'We want to see
Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don't want anything else.'
"Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to
the gopis. He said to them: 'I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you
see only one form of Mine?' The gopis cried in chorus: 'O Krishna, do You want to go
away from us? Is that why You are instructing us in Brahmajnana?'
"Do you know the attitude of the gopis? It is this: 'We are Radha's and Radha is ours.' "
A DEVOTEE: "Does this 'I' of the devotee never disappear altogether?"
519MASTER: "Yes, it disappears at times. Then one attains the Knowledge of Brahman and
goes into samādhi. I too lose it, but not for all the time. In the musical scale there are
seven notes: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni. But one cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a
long time. One must bring it down again to the lower notes. I pray to the Divine Mother,
'Mother, do not give me Brahmajnana.' Formerly believers in God with form used to visit
me a great deal. Then the modern Brahmajnanis began to arrive. During that period I
used to remain unconscious in samādhi most of the time. Whenever I regained
consciousness, I would say to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, please don't give me
Brahmajnana.'"
God listens to our prayer
PUNDIT: "Does God listen to our prayers?"
MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. You will certainly get whatever
you ask of Him. But you must pray standing near the Kalpataru. Only then will your
prayer be fulfilled. But you must remember another thing. God knows our inner feeling.
A man gets the fulfillment of the desire he cherishes while practising sadhana. As one
thinks, so one receives. A magician was showing his tricks before a king. Now and then
he exclaimed: 'Come confusion! Come delusion! O King, give me money! Give me
clothes!' Suddenly his tongue turned upward and clove to the roof of his mouth. He
experienced kumbhaka. He could utter neither word nor sound, and became motionless.
People thought he was dead. They built a vault of bricks and buried him there in that
posture. After a thousand years someone dug into the vault. Inside it people found a
man seated in samādhi. They took him for a holy man and worshipped him. When they
shook him his tongue was loosened and regained its normal position. The magician
became conscious of the outer world and cried, as he had a thousand years before:
'Come confusion! Come delusion! O King, give me money! Give me clothes!'
"I used to weep, praying to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, destroy with Thy thunderbolt
my inclination to reason.' "
PUNDIT: "Then you too had an inclination to reason?"
MASTER :"Yes, once."
PUNDIT: "Then please assure us that we shall get rid of that inclination too. How did you
get rid of yours?"
MASTER: "Oh, somehow or other."
Sri Ramakrishna was silent awhile. Then he went on with his conversation.
MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru. One should pray standing near It. Then one will get
whatever one desires.
"How many things God has created! Infinite is His universe. But what need have I to
know about His infinite splendours? If I must know these, let me first realize Him. Then
520God Himself will tell me all about them. What need have I to know how many houses
and how many government securities Jadu Mallick possesses? All that I need is somehow
to converse with Jadu Mallick. I may succeed in seeing him by jumping over a ditch or
through a petition or after being pushed about by his gate-keeper. Once I get a chance
to talk to him, then he himself will tell me all about his possessions if I ask him. If one
becomes acquainted with the master, then one is respected by his officers too. (All
laugh.)
"There are some who do not care to know the splendours of God. What do I care about
knowing how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One bottle is enough for me.
Why should I desire the knowledge of God's splendours? I am intoxicated with the little
wine I have swallowed.
"Both bhaktiyoga and jnanayoga are paths by which you can realize God. Whatever path
you may follow, you will certainly realize Him. The path of bhakti is an easy one. The
path of knowledge and discrimination is very difficult. Why should one reason so much to
know which path is the best? I talked about this with Vijay for many days. Once I told
him about a man who used to pray, 'O God, reveal to me who and what You are.'
"The path of knowledge and discrimination is difficult indeed. Parvati, the Divine Mother,
revealed Her various forms to Her father and said, 'Father, if you want Brahmajnana,
then live in the company of holy men.'
"Brahman cannot be described in words. It is said in the Rāma Gitā that Brahman has
only been indirectly hinted at by the scriptures. When one speaks about the 'cowherd
village on the Ganges', one indirectly states that the village is situated on the bank of
the Ganges.
"Why shouldn't a man be able to realize the formless Brahman? But it is extremely
difficult. He cannot if he has even the slightest trace of worldliness. He can be directly
aware of Brahman in his inmost consciousness only when he renounces all sense-
objects―form, taste, smell, touch, and sound and only when his mind completely stops
functioning. And then too, he knows only this much of Brahman―that It exists."
Quoting from an Upanishad, the pundit said, "It is to be experienced only as Existence."
MASTER: "In order to realize God a devotee should make use of a particular attitude-the
attitude of a 'hero' or a friend or a handmaid or a child."
MANI MALLICK: "Only then can one feel attached to God."
MASTER: "For many days I cherished the feeling that I was a companion of the Divine
Mother. I used to say: 'I am the handmaid of Brahmamayi, the Blissful Mother. O
companions of the Divine Mother, make me the Mother's handmaid! I shall go about
proudly, saying, "I am Brahmamayi's handmaid!"
521Different classes of perfect souls
"Some souls realize God without practising any spiritual discipline. They are called
nityasiddha, eternally perfect. Those who have realized God through austerity, japa, and
the like, are called sadhanasiddha, perfect through spiritual discipline. Again, there are
those called kripasiddha, perfect through divine grace. These last may be compared to a
room kept dark a thousand years, which becomes light the moment a lamp is brought in.
"There is also a class of devotees, the hathatsiddha, that is to say, those who have
suddenly attained God-vision. Their case is like that of a poor boy who has suddenly
found favour with a rich man. The rich man marries his daughter to the boy and along
with her gives him land, house, carriage, servants, and so forth.
"There is still another class of devotees, the svapnasiddha, who have had the vision of
God in a dream."
SURENDRA (smiling): "Let us go to sleep then. We shall wake and find ourselves babus,
aristocrats."
MASTER (tenderly): "You are already a babu. When the letter 'a' is joined to the letter
'ka', 'ka' becomes 'kaa'. It is futile to add another 'a'. If you add it, you will still have the
same 'kaa'. (All laugh.)
Description of the nitya-siddha
"The nityasiddha is in a class apart. He is like arani wood. A little rubbing produces fire.
You can get fire from it even without rubbing. The nityasiddha realizes God by practising
slight spiritual discipline and sometimes without practising any at all. But he does
practise spiritual discipline after realizing God. He is like the gourd or pumpkin vine―first
fruit, then flower."
The pundit smiled at this illustration.
MASTER: "There is the instance of Prahlada. He was a nityasiddha. While writing the
letter 'ka' he shed a stream of tears."
The Master was pleased with the pundit's humility. He praised him to the devotees.
MASTER: "He has such a nice nature. You find no difficulty in driving a nail into a mud
wall. But its point breaks if you try to drive it against a stone; and still it will not pierce
it. There are people whose spiritual consciousness is not at all awakened even though
they hear about God a thousand times. They are like a crocodile, on whose hide you
cannot make any impression with a sword "
PUNDIT: "But one can hurt a crocodile by throwing a spear into its belly." (All laugh.)
MASTER (smiling): "What good is there in reading a whole lot of scriptures? What good
is there in the study of philosophy? What is the use of talking big? In order to learn
522archery one should first aim at a banana tree, then at a reed, then at a wick, and last at
a flying bird. At the beginning one should concentrate on God with form.
"Then there are devotees who are beyond the three gunas. They are eternally devoted to
God, like Nārada. These devotees behold Krishna as Chinmaya, all Spirit, His Abode as
Chinmaya, His devotee as Chinmaya. To them God is eternal, His Abode is eternal, His
devotee is eternal.
"Those who reason and speculate following the process of 'Neti, neti' do not accept the
Incarnation of God. Hazra says well that Divine Incarnation is only for the bhakta, and
not for the Jnāni, because the Jnāni is quite contented with his ideal, 'I am He'."
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees remained silent awhile. The pundit resumed the
conversation.
PUNDIT: "Sir, how does one get rid of callousness? Laughter makes me think of muscles
and nerves. Grief makes me think of the nervous system."
MASTER (smiling): "That is why Narayan Shastri used to say, The harmful effect of the
study of the scriptures is that it encourages reasoning and arguing.'"
PUNDIT: "Is there no way for us then?"
MASTER: "Yes, there is the path of discrimination. In a song occurs the line: 'Ask her son
Discrimination about the Truth.'
"The way lies through discrimination, renunciation, and passionate yearning for God.
Unless a man practises discrimination, he cannot utter the right words. One time, after
expounding religion at great length, Pundit Samadhyayi said, 'God is dry.' He reminded
me of the man who once said, 'My uncle's cow-shed is full of horses.' Now, does anyone
keep horses in a cowshed? (With a smile) You have become like a chānābarā fried in
butter. Now it will be good for you and for others as well, if you are soaked in syrup a
few days. Just a few days."
PUNDIT (smiling): "The sweetmeat is over-fried. It has become charred."
MASTER (with a laugh): "No! No! It is brown as a cockroach. Just the right colour."
HAZRA: "The sweetmeat is well cooked. It has become spongy. Now it will soak up the
syrup nicely."
MASTER: "You see, there is no need to read too much of the scriptures. If you read too
much you will be inclined to reason and argue. Nangta used to teach me thus: What you
get by repeating the word 'Gitā' tell times is the essence of the book. In other words, if
you repeat 'Gitā' ten times it is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.
523"Yes, the way to realize God is through discrimination, renunciation, and yearning for
Him. What kind of yearning? One should yearn for God as the cow, with yearning heart,
runs after its calf."
PUNDIT: "The same thing is said in the Vedas: 'O God, we call on Thee as the cow lows
for the calf.'"
MASTER: "Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce everything through
discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able to see God. That yearning brings
about God-intoxication, whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of
devotion. The sage Durvasa was mad with the Knowledge of God.
"There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a householder and that of
an all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder's knowledge is like the light of a lamp,
which illumines only the inside of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such
knowledge, except his own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the all-
renouncing monk is like the light of the sun. Through that light he can see both, inside
and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva's knowledge had the brilliance of the sun-the sun
of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing light of the moon of Devotion. He was
endowed with both-the Knowledge of Brahman and ecstatic love of God.
(To the pundit) "One can attain spiritual consciousness through both affirmation and
negation. There is the positive path of love and devotion, and there is the negative path
of knowledge and discrimination. You are preaching the path of knowledge. But that
creates a very difficult situation: there the guru and the disciple do not see each other.
Sukadeva went to Janaka for instruction about the Knowledge of Brahman. Janaka said
to him: 'You must pay me the guru's fee beforehand. When you attain the knowledge of
Brahman you won't pay me the fee, because the knower of Brahman sees no difference
between the guru and the disciple.'
Different stages of divine love
"Both negation and affirmation are ways to realize one and the same goal. Infinite are
the opinions and infinite are the ways. But you must remember one thing. The injunction
is that the path of devotion described by Nārada is best suited to the Kaliyuga. According
to this path, first comes bhakti; then bhava, when bhakti is mature. Higher than bhava
are mahabhava and prema. An ordinary mortal does not attain mahabhava and prema.
He who has achieved these has realized the goal, that is to say, has attained God."
PUNDIT: "In expounding religion one has to use a great many words."
MASTER: "While preaching, eliminate the 'head and tail', that is to say, emphasize only
the essentials."
The pundit and Mani Mallick became engaged in conversation. Mani was a member of the
Brahmo Samaj. The pundit argued vehemently about the good and bad sides of the
Samaj. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the small couch and looked on, smiling. Presently
he remarked: "This is the tamasic aspect of sattva, the attitude of a hero. This is
524necessary. One should not hold one's tongue at the sight of injustice and untruth.
Suppose a bad woman wants to drag you from the path of righteousness. You must then
assume the heroic attitude and say: 'What? You witch! You dare injure my spiritual life? I
shall cut your body in two right now.' "
With a smile Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Mani Mallick has been following the
tenets of the Brahmo Samaj a long time. You can't convert him to your views. Is it an
easy thing to destroy old tendencies? Once there lived a very pious Hindu who always
worshipped the Divine Mother and chanted Her name. When the Mussalmans conquered
the country, they forced him embrace Islam. They said to him: 'You are now a
Mussalman. Say "Allah". From now on you must repeat only the name of Allah.' With
great difficulty he repeated the word 'Allah', but every now and then blurted out
'Jagadamba'. At that the Mussalmans were about to beat him. Thereupon he said to
them: 'I beseech you! Please do not kill me. I have been trying my utmost to repeat the
name of Allah, but our Jagadamba has filled me up to the throat. She pushes out your
Allah.' (All laugh.)
Different paths to suit different tastes
(To the pundit) "Please don't say anything to Mani Mallick. You must know that there are
different tastes. There are also different powers of digestion. God has made different
religions and creeds to suit different aspirants. By no means all are fit for the Knowledge
of Brahman. Therefore the worship of God with form has been provided.
"The mother brings home a fish for her children. She curries part of the fish, part she
fries, and with another part she makes pilau. By no means all can digest the pilau. So
she makes fish soup for those who have weak stomachs. Further, some want pickled or
fried fish. There are different temperaments. There are differences in the capacity to
comprehend."
All sat in silence. Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit, "Go and visit the temples and take
a stroll in the garden." It was about half past five in the afternoon. The pundit left the
room with his friends and several of the devotees.
After a while the Master went with M. toward the bathing-ghat on the Ganges. He said to
M., "Baburam now says, 'What shall I gain by study?' "On the bank of the river he met
the pundit and said to him, "Aren't you going to the Kāli temple?" The pundit said: "Yes,
sir. Let us go together." With a smiling face Sri Ramakrishna proceeded to the temple
through the courtyard. He said to the pundit, "Listen to a song."
He sang:
Is Kāli, my Mother, really black?
The Naked One, of blackest hue,
Lights the Lotus of the Heart. . . .
As he was going through the courtyard, he quoted to the pundit from a song:
525Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart,
Behold the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment.
They came to the temple. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother, touching the
ground with his forehead.
Red hibiscus flowers and vilwa-leaves adorned the Mother's feet. Her three eyes radiated
love for Her devotees. Two of Her hands were raised as if to give them boons and
reassurance; the other two hands held symbols of death. She was clothed in a sari of
Benares silk and was decked with ornaments.
Image of Kāli
Referring to the image, one of the party remarked, "I heard it was made by the sculptor
Nabin." The Master answered: "Yes, I know. But to me She is the Embodiment of Spirit."
As Sri Ramakrishna was coming back to his room with the devotees, he said to
Baburam, "Come with us." M. also joined them.
It was dusk. The Master was sitting on the semicircular porch west of his room. Baburam
and M. sat near him. He was in a mood of partial ecstasy.
Rākhāl was not then living with Sri Ramakrishna, and therefore the Master was having
difficulties about his personal service. Several devotees lived with him, but he could not
bear the touch of everyone during his spiritual moods. He hinted to Baburam: "Do stay
with me. It will be very nice. In this mood I cannot allow others to touch me."
The pundit entered the Master's room after visiting the temples. The Master said to him
from the porch, "Take some refreshments." The pundit said that he had not yet
performed his evening devotions. At once Sri Ramakrishna stood up and sang in an
exalted mood:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or
Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli's name upon my
lips?
What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any
more,
If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours? . . .
Intoxicated With ecstatic love, the Master said: "How long should one perform
devotions? So long as one's mind does not merge in God while repeating Om."
PUNDIT: "Then let me eat the refreshments. I shall perform the devotions later on."
MASTER: "No, I don't want to obstruct the current of your life. It is not good to renounce
anything before the proper time arrives. When the fruit ripens, the flower drops off of
526itself. One shouldn't forcibly tear off the green branch of a coconut tree. That injures the
tree."
Surendra was about to leave. He invited his friends into his carriage. The Master, still in
an ecstatic mood, said, "Don't take more people than your horse can draw." Suredra
took leave of Sri Ramakrishna. The pundit left the room to perform his worship. M. and
Baburam saluted the Master. They were about to leave for Calcutta. Sri Ramakrishna
was still in an ecstatic mood.
MASTER (to M.): "I cannot utter a word now. Stay a few minutes."
M. again took his seat and waited for the Master's command. Sri Ramakrishna motioned
to Baburam to take a seat and asked him to fan him a little. M. also took part in
rendering this personal service to the Master.
MASTER (to M., tenderly): "Why don't you come here so frequently now?"
M: "Not for any special reason. I have been rather busy at home."
MASTER: "Yesterday I came to know Baburam's inner nature. That is why I have been
trying so hard to persuade him to live with me. The mother bird hatches the egg in
proper time. Boys like Baburam are pure in heart. They have not yet fallen into the
clutches of 'woman and gold'. Isn't that so?"
M: "It is true, sir. They are still stainless."
MASTER: "They are like a new pot. Milk kept in it will not turn sour."
M: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "I need Baburam here. I pass through certain spiritual states when I need
someone like him. He says he must not, all at once, live with me permanently, for it will
create difficulties. His relatives will make trouble. I am asking him to come here
Saturdays and Sundays."
Master's advice to householders
The pundit entered the room with his friends. He had finished his devotions and was
ready to eat the refreshments. One of his companions asked the Master: "Shall we
succeed in spiritual life? Please tell us what our way is."
MASTER: "You all have the yearning for liberation. If an aspirant has yearning, that is
enough for him to realize God. Don't eat any food of the sraaddha ceremony. Live in the
world like an unchaste woman. She performs her household duties with great attention,
but her mind dwells day and night on her paramour. Perform your duties in the world but
keep your mind always fixed on God.
The pundit finished eating his refreshments.
527MASTER (to the pundit): "You have read the Gitā, no doubt. It says that there is a
special power of God in the man who is honoured and respected by all."
The pundit quoted the verse from the Gitā.
MASTER: "You surely possess divine power."
PUNDIT: "Shall I labour with perseverance to finish the task that I have accepted?"
Sri Ramakrishna forced himself, as it were, to say, "Yes." He soon changed the
conversation.
MASTER: "One cannot but admit the manifestation of power. Vidyasagar once asked me,
'Has God given more power to some than to others?' I said to him: 'Certainly. Otherwise,
how can one man kill a hundred? If there is no special manifestation of power, then why
is Queen Victoria so much honoured and respected? Don't you admit it?' He agreed with
me."
The pundit and his friends saluted the Master and were about to take their leave. Sri
Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Come again. One hemp-smoker rejoices in the
company of another hemp-smoker. They even embrace each other. But they hide at the
sight of people not of their own kind. A cow licks the body of her calf; but she threatens
a strange cow with her horns." (All laugh.)
The pundit left the room. With a smile the Master said: "He has become 'diluted' even in
one day. Did you notice how modest he was? And he accepted everything I said."
Moonlight flooded the semicircular porch. Sri Ramakrishna was still seated there. M. was
about to leave.
MASTER (tenderly): "Must you go now?"
M.: "Yes, sir. Let me say good-bye."
MASTER: "I have been thinking of visiting the houses of the devotees. I want to visit
yours also. What do you say?"
M.: "That will be very fine."
Thursday, July 3, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in Balarām Bose's house in Calcutta. It was the day of the
"Return Car Festival". The Lord of the Universe was worshipped in Balarām's house as
Jagannath. There was a small car in the house for use during the Car Festival.
Balarām's father
Balarām's father was a pious Vaishnava who devoted most of his time to prayer and
meditation in his garden house at Vrindāvan. He also studied devotional books and
528enjoyed the company of devotees. Balarām had brought his father to Calcutta to meet
the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy mood. Seated near him were Ram, Balarām,
Balarām's father, M., Manomohan, and several young devotees. He was conversing with
them.
Dogmatism in religion
MASTER (to Balarām's father and the others): "The Bhaktamala is one of the Vaishnava
books. It is a fine book. It describes the lives of the various Vaishnava devotees. But it is
one-sided. At one place the author found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati,
the Divine Mother, to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline.
"Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to invite
Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great courtesy. He fed his
guest from silver plates. Then do you know what happened? Vaishnav said in front of
Mathur, 'You will achieve nothing whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna
as your Ideal.' Mathur was a follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine
Mother. At once his face became crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan.
"I understand that the Bhagavata also contains some statements like that. I hear that it
is said there that trying to cross the ocean of the world without accepting Krishna as the
Ideal Deity is like trying to cross a great sea by holding the tail of a dog. Each sect
magnifies its own view.
"The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas say that Krishna alone is
the Helmsman to take one across the ocean of the world. The Saktas retort: 'Oh, yes!
We agree to that. Our Divine Mother is the Empress of the Universe. Why should She
bother about a ferry-boat? Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the
purpose.' (All laugh.)
"Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers in the villages
near Kamarpukur. Many of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: 'Which
Vishnu does he worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn't touch him!' Or: 'Which Śiva are
you talking about? We accept the Atmaramasiva.' Or again, 'Please explain to us which
Hari you worship'. They spin their yarn and indulge in talk like that.
"Rati's mother, Rani Katyayani's favourite confidante, is a follower of Vaishnavcharan.
She is a bigoted Vaishnava. She used to visit me very frequently, and none could outdo
her in devotion. One day she noticed me eating the prasad from the Kāli temple. Since
then I haven't seen even her shadow.
Master's harmony of religions
"He is indeed a real man who has harmonized everything. Most people are one-sided.
But I find that all opinions point to the One. All views-the Sakta, the Vaishnava, the
Vedānta-have that One for their centre. He who is formless is, again, endowed with
529form. It is He who appears in different forms: The attributeless Brahman is my Father.
God with attributes is my Mother. Whom shall I blame? Whom shall I praise? The two
pans of the scales are equally heavy.'
"He who is described in the Vedas is also described in the Tantras and the Puranas. All of
them speak about the one Satchidananda. The Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of
the one Reality. It is described in the Vedas as 'Om Satchidananda Brahman', in the
Tantras as 'Om Satchidananda Śiva', the ever-pure Śiva, and in the Puranas as 'Om
Satchidananda Krishna'. All the scriptures, the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras,
speak only of one Satchidananda. It is stated in the Vaishnava scripture that it is Krishna
Himself who has become Kāli."
Sri Ramakrishna went to the porch for a few minutes and then returned. As he was
going out, Vishvamvhar's daughter, six or seven years old, saluted him. On returning to
the room, the Master began talking to the little girl and her companions, who were of the
same age.
THE CHILD (to the Master): "I saluted you and you didn't even notice it."
MASTER (smiling): "Did you? I really didn't notice."
CHILD: "Then wait. I want to salute you again-the other foot too."
Sri Ramakrishna laughed and sat down. He returned the salute and bowed to the child,
touching the ground with his forehead. He asked her to sing. The child said, "I swear I
don't sing." When the Master pressed her again, she said, "Should you press me when I
said 'I swear'?" The Master was very happy with the children and sang light and frivolous
songs to entertain them. He sang:
Come, let me braid your hair,
Lest your husband should scold you
When he beholds you!
The children and the devotees laughed.
Childlike nature of a Paramahamsa
MASTER (to the devotees): "The paramahamsa is like a five-year-old child. He sees
everything filled with Consciousness. At one time I was staying at Kamarpukur when
Shivaram was four or five years old. One day he was trying to catch grasshoppers near
the pond. The leaves were moving. To stop their rustling he said to the leaves: 'Hush!
Hush! I want to catch a grasshopper.' Another day it was stormy. It rained hard.
Shivaram was with me inside the house. There were flashes of lightning. He wanted to
open the door and go out. I scolded him and stopped him, but still he peeped out now
and then. When he saw the lightning he exclaimed, 'There, uncle! They are striking
matches again!'
530"The paramahamsa is like a child. He cannot distinguish between a stranger and a
relative. He isn't particular about worldly relationships. One day Shivaram said to me,
'Uncle, are you my father's brother or his brother-in-law?'
"The paramahamsa is like a child. He doesn't keep any track of his whereabouts. He sees
everything as Brahman. He is indifferent to his own movements. Shivaram went to
Hriday's house to see the Durga Puja. He slipped out of the house and wandered away. A
passer-by saw the child, who was then only four years old, and asked, 'Where do you
come from?' He couldn't say much. He only said the word 'hut'. He was speaking of the
big hut in which the image of the Divine Mother was being worshipped. The stranger
asked him further, 'Whom are you living with?' He only said the word 'brother'.
Other traits of a Paramahamsa
"Sometimes the paramahamsa behaves like a madman. When I experienced that divine
madness I used to worship my own sexual organ as the Śiva-phallus. But I can't do that
now. A few days after the dedication of the temple at Dakshineswar, a madman came
there who was really a sage endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman. He had a bamboo
twig in one hand and a potted mango-plant in the other, and was wearing torn shoes. He
didn't follow any social conventions. After bathing in the Ganges he didn't perform any
religious rites. He ate something that he carried in a corner of his wearing-cloth. Then he
entered the Kāli temple and chanted hymns to the Deity. The temple trembled. Haladhāri
was then in the shrine. The madman wasn't allowed to eat at the guest-house, but he
paid no attention to this slight. He searched for food in the rubbish heap where the dogs
were eating crumbs from the discarded leaf-plates. Now and then he pushed the dogs
aside to get his crumbs. The dogs didn't mind either. Haladhāri followed him and asked:
'Who are you? Are you a purnajnani?' The madman whispered, 'Sh! Yes, I am a
purnajnani.' My heart began to palpitate as Haladhāri told me about it. I clung to Hriday.
I said to the Divine Mother, 'Mother, shall I too have to pass through such a state?' We
all went to see the man. He spoke words of great wisdom to us but behaved like a
madman before others. Haladhāri followed him a great way when he left the garden.
After passing the gate he said to Haladhāri: 'What else shall I say to you? When you no
longer make any distinction between the water of this pool and the water of the Ganges,
then you will know that you have Perfect Knowledge.' Saying this he walked rapidly
away."
Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with M. Other devotees, too, were present.
MASTER (to M.): "How do you feel about Shashadhar?"
M: "He is very nice."
MASTER: "He is very intelligent, isn't he?"
M: "Yes, sir. He is very erudite."
MASTER: "According to the Gitā there is a power of God in one who is respected and
honoured by many. But Shashadhar has still a few things to do.
531What will he accomplish with mere scholarship? He needs to practise some austerity. It
is necessary to practise some spiritual discipline.
"Gauri Pundit practised austerity. When he chanted a hymn to the Divine Mother, the
other pundits would seem no more than earthworms.
"Narayan Shastri was not merely a scholar, either. He practised sadhana as well. He
studied for twenty-five years without a break. Nyaya alone, he studied for seven years.
Still he would go into ecstasy while repeating the name of Śiva. The King of Jaipur
wanted to make him his court pundit, but Narayan refused. He used to spend much time
here. He had a great desire to go to the Vasishtha Āśrama to practise tapasya. He often
spoke to me about it, but I forbade him to go there. At that he said: 'Who knows when I
shall die? When shall I practise sadhana? Any day I may crack.' After much insistence on
his part I let him go. Some say that he is dead, that he died while practising austerity.
Others say that he is still alive and that they saw him off on a railway train.
Master and Keshab
"Before meeting Keshab, I asked Narayan Shastri to visit him and tell me what he
thought of him. Narayan reported that Keshab was an adept in japa. He knew astrology
and remarked that Keshab had been born under a good star. Then I went to visit Keshab
in the garden house at Belgharia. Hriday was with me. The moment I saw Keshab, I
said: 'Of all the people I see here, he alone has dropped his tail. He can now live on land
as well as in water, like a frog.'
"Keshab sent three members of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden at
Dakshineswar to test me. Prasanna was one of them. They were commissioned to watch
me day and night, and to report to Keshab. They were in my room and intended to
spend the night there. They constantly uttered the word 'Dayamaya' and said to me:
'Follow Keshab Babu. That will do you good.' I said, 'I believe in God with form.' Still
they went on with their exclamations of 'Dayamaya!' Then a strange mood came over
me. I said to them, 'Get out of here!' I didn't allow them to spend the night in my room.
So they slept on the verandah. Captain also spent the night in the temple garden the
first time he visited me.
"Michael visited the temple garden when Narayan Shastri was living with me. Dwarika
Babu, Mathur's eldest son, brought him here. The owners of the temple garden were
about to get into a lawsuit with the English proprietors of the neighbouring powder
magazine; so they wanted Michael's advice. I met him in the big room next to the
manager's office. Narayan Shastri was with me. I asked Narayan to talk to him. Michael
couldn't talk very well in Sanskrit. He made mistakes. Then they talked in the popular
dialect. Narayan Shastri asked him his reason for giving up the Hindu religion. Pointing
to his stomach, Michael said, 'It was for this.' Narayan said, 'What shall I say to a man
who gives up his religion for his belly's sake?' Thereupon Michael asked me to say
something. I said: 'I don't know why, but I don't feel like saying anything. Someone
seems to be pressing my tongue.' "
532MANOMOHAN: "Mr. Choudhury will not come. He said: 'That fellow Shashadhar from
Faridpur will be there. I shall not go.' "
Mr. Choudhury had obtained his Master's degree from Calcutta University. He drew a
salary of three or four hundred rupees. After the death of his first wife he had felt
intense dispassion for the world, but after some time he had married again. He
frequently visited the Master at the temple garden.
MASTER: "How mean of him! He is vain of his scholarship. Besides, he has married a
second time. He looks on the world as a mere mud-puddle.
(To the devotees) "This attachment to 'woman and gold' makes a man small-minded.
When I first saw Haramohan he had many good traits. I longed to see him. He was then
seventeen or eighteen years old. I used to send for him every now and then, but he
wouldn't come. He is now living away from the family with his wife. He had been living
with his uncle before. That was very good. He had no worldly troubles. Now he has a
separate home and does the marketing for his wife daily. The other day he came to
Dakshineswar. I said to him: 'Go away. Leave this place. I don't even feel like touching
you.' "
Sri Ramakrishna went to the inner apartments to see the Deity. He offered some flowers.
The ladies of Balarām's family were pleased to see him.
The Master came back to the drawing-room and said: "The worldly minded practise
devotions, japa, and austerity only by fits and starts. But those who know nothing else
but God repeat His name with every breath. Some always repeat mentally, 'Om Rāma'.
Even the followers of the path of knowledge repeat, 'Soham', 'I am He'. There are others
whose tongues are always moving, repeating the name of God. One should remember
and think of God constantly."
Pundit Shashadhar entered the room with one or two friends and saluted the Master.
MASTER (smiling): "We are like the bridesmaids waiting near the bed for the arrival of
the groom."
The pundit laughed. The room was filled with devotees, among them Dr.Pratap and
Balarām's father. The Master continued his talk.
MASTER (to Shashadhar): "The first sign of knowledge is a peaceful nature, and the
second is absence of egotism. You have both. There are other indications of a Jnāni. He
shows intense dispassion in the presence of a sādhu, is a lion when at work, for instance,
when he lectures, and is full of wit before his wife. (All laugh.)
"But the nature of the vijnāni is quite different, as was the case with Chaitanyadeva. He
acts like a child or a madman or an inert thing or a ghoul. While in the mood of a child,
he sometimes shows childlike guilelessness, sometimes the frivolity of adolescence, and
sometimes, while instructing others, the strength of a young man."
533Three kinds of bhakti
PUNDIT: "By what kind of bhakti does one realize God?"
MASTER: "Three kinds of bhakti are found, according to the nature of the man: sattvic
bhakti, rajasic bhakti, and tamasic bhakti.
"Sattvic bhakti is known to God alone. It makes no outward display. A man with such
devotion loves privacy. Perhaps he meditates inside the mosquito net, where nobody
sees him. When this kind of devotion is awakened, one hasn't long to wait for the vision
of God. The appearance of the dawn in the east shows that the sun will rise before long.
"A man with rajasic bhakti feels like making a display of his devotion before others. He
worships the Deity with 'sixteen ingredients', enters the temple wearing a silk cloth, and
puts around his neck a string of rudrāksha beads interspersed here and there with beads
of gold and ruby.
"A man with tamasic bhakti shows the courage and boisterousness of a highway robber.
A highway robber goes on his expedition openly, shouting, 'Kill! Plunder!' He isn't afraid
even of eight police inspectors. The devotee with tamasic bhakti also shouts like a
madman:'Hara! Hara! Vyom! Vyom! Victory to Kāli!' He has great strength of mind and
burning faith.
"A Sakta has such faith. He says: 'What? I have uttered once the name of Kāli and of
Durga! I have uttered once the name of Rāma! Can there be any sin in me?'
"The Vaishnavas have a very humble and lowly attitude. (Looking at Balarām's father)
They tell their rosary and whine and whimper: 'O Krishna, be gracious to us! We are
wretched! We are sinners!'
Faith in God's name
"A man should have such fiery faith as to be able to say, 'I have uttered the name of
God; how can I be a sinner?' Imagine a man repeating the name of Hari day and night
and at the same time saying that he is a sinner!"
So saying, Sri Ramakrishna became overwhelmed with divine ecstasy and sang:
If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name,
How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,
Withhold from me deliverance,
Wretched though I may be?
I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,
Or slain a woman or a cow,
Or even caused a brahmin's death;
But, though it all be true,
Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;
For through the power of Thy sweet name
534My wretched soul may still aspire
Even to Brahmanhood.
He sang again:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!
Drunk with a draught of celestial wine, She reels, and yet She
does not fall.
Erect She stands on Śiva's bosom, and the earth trembles under
Her tread;
She and Her Lord are mad with frenzy, casting aside all fear
and shame!
Pundit Shashadhar was weeping. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, sang:
O tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga!
Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress?
Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world;
From Thee have the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Śiva sprung.
The ten Embodiments of Divine Śakti art Thou,
And Thou the ten Avatars: this time, save me Thou must!
The moving and the unmoving, the gross and the subtle, art
Thou;
Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution.
Thou art the Primal Root of this manifold universe;
The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou;
Thou art the Śakti of all, and Thou Thine own Śakti, too.
As the Master listened to the last few lines, he went into an ecstatic mood. The Master
himself sang:
O Mother, for Yaśoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called
Thee her precious "Blue Jewel";
Where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, O terrible Syama?
Dance that way once for me, O Mother! Throw down Thy
sword and take the flute;
Cast off Thy garland of heads, and wear Thy wild-flower
garland.
If without Śiva Thou canst not dance, then let Balarama be Thy
Śiva.
Dance, O Syama, as Thou didst dance when Thou wert
Krishna!
Mother, play on Thy flute again, once so full of delight for the
gopis;
Play again on Thy magic flute, which called the cattle in from
the pasture,
Stopping the Jamuna's murmuring flow and turning it
535backward.
Hot in the sky the sun would burn, when Yaśoda, restless for
her Krishna,
Fondly would call: "Here, my Gopala! Cream and butter-eat
them, my Darling!"
And she would comb His long black hair and carefully braid
it.
Bending Thy supple body, Mother, both at the neck, the waist,
and the knee,
Thou didst dance with Thy friend Sridāmā, while Thy two
anklets played the music:
Ta-thaia! Ta-thaia! Ta-ta! Thaia-thaia!
Hearing their captivating sound, the gopis would rush there.
Again Pundit Shashadhar shed tears of love.
Sri Ramakrishna came down to consciousness of the world. Pointing to Shashadhar, he
said to M., "Why don't you prod him?" He wanted M. or some other devotee to ask
Shashadhar a question.
RAMDAYAL (to Shashadhar): "The scriptures speak of Brahman's form as a projection of
mind. Who is it that projects?"
SHASHADHAR: "It is Brahman Itself that does so. It is no projection of a man's mind."
PRATAP: "Why does Brahman project the form?"
MASTER: "You ask why? Brahman doesn't act in consultation with others. It is Brahman's
pleasure. Brahman is self-willed. Why should we try to know the reason for Brahman's
acting this way or that? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Eat the
mangoes. What is the good of calculating how many trees there are in the orchard, how
many thousands of branches, and how many millions of leaves? One cannot realize Truth
by futile arguments and reasoning."
PRATAP: "Shouldn't we reason any more then?"
MASTER: "I am asking you not to indulge in futile reasoning. But reason, by all means,
about the Real and the unreal, about what is permanent and what is transitory. You
must reason when you are overcome by lust, anger, or grief."
SHASHADHAR: "That is different. It is called reasoning based on discrimination."
MASTER: "Yes, discrimination between the Real and the unreal."
All sat in silence. Again the Master spoke, addressing the pundit.
MASTER: "Formerly many great men used to come here."
536SHASHADHAR: "You mean rich people?"
MASTER: "No. Great scholars."
In the mean time the small car of Jagannath had been brought to the verandah. Inside
the car were the images of Krishna, Balarama, and Subhadra. They were adorned with
flowers, garlands, jewelry, and yellow apparel. Balarām was a sattvic worshipper: there
was no outward grandeur in his worship. Outsiders did not even know of this Car Festival
at his house. The Master and the devotees went to the verandah. Sri Ramakrishna pulled
the car by the rope. Then he began to sing:
See how all Nadia is shaking
Under the waves of Gaurānga's love. . . .
He sang again:
Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting
Hari's name,
The brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari's
love. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. The musician and his party joined the Master
in the music and dancing. Soon the whole verandah was filled with people. The ladies
witnessed this scene of joy from an adjoining room. It appeared as if Chaitanya himself
were dancing with his devotees, intoxicated with divine love.
It was not yet dusk. Sri Ramakrishna returned to the drawing-room with the devotees.
MASTER (to Shashadhar): "This is called bhajanananda, the bliss of devotees in the
worship of God. Worldly people keep themselves engrossed in the joy of sensuous
objects, of 'woman and gold'. Through worship devotees receive the grace of God, and
then His vision. Then they enjoy Brahmananda, the Bliss of Brahman."
Shashadhar and the devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.
SHASHADHAR (humbly): "Sir, please tell us what kind of yearning gives one this blissful
state of mind."
MASTER: "One feels restless for God when one's soul longs for His vision. The guru said
to the disciple: 'Come with me. I shall show you what kind of longing will enable you to
see God.' Saying this, he took the disciple to a pond and pressed his head under the
water. After a few moments he released the disciple and asked, 'How did you feel?' The
disciple answered: 'Oh, I felt as if I were dying! I was longing for a breath of air.' "
SHASHADHAR: "Yes! Yes! That's it. I understand it now."
MASTER: "To love God is the essence of the whole thing. Bhakti alone is the essence.
Nārada said to Rāma, 'May I always have pure love for Your Lotus Feet; and may I not
537be deluded by Your world-bewitching māyā!' Rāma said to him, 'Ask for some other
boon.' 'No,' said Nārada, 'I don't want anything else. May I have love for Your Lotus
Feet. This is my only prayer.' "
Pundit Shashadhar was ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked a devotee to bring a
carriage for the pundit.
SHASHADHAR: "Don't trouble yourself. I shall walk."
MASTER (smiling): "Oh, how can that be? 'You are beyond the reach of even Brahma's
meditation.' "
SHASHADHAR: "There is no particular need of my going just now. The only thing is that
I shall have to perform my sandhya."
MASTER: "The Divine Mother has taken away my sandhya and other devotions. The
purpose of the sandhya is to purify body and mind. I am no longer in that state."
The Master sang the following lines of a song:
When will you learn to lie, O mind, in the abode of Blessedness,
With Cleanliness and Defilement on either side of you?
Only when you have found the way
To keep these wives contentedly under a single roof,
Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama.
Pundit Shashadhar saluted the Master and went away.
RAM: "I visited Shashadhar yesterday. You asked me to."
MASTER: "Did I? I don't remember. But it is nice that you went."
RAM: "The editor of a newspaper was abusing you."
MASTER: "Suppose he was. What does it matter?"
RAM: "Please listen. Then I began to talk to the editor about you. He wanted to hear
more and wouldn't let me go."
It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna began to chant the names of the Divine Mother, Krishna,
Rāma, and Hari. The devotees sat in silence. The Master chanted the names in such
sweet tones that the hearts of the devotees were deeply touched. That day Balarām's
house was like Navadvip when Chaitanya lived there. On the verandah it was like
Navadvip, and in the parlour it was like Vrindāvan.
538That same night Sri Ramakrishna was to go to Dakshineswar. Balarām took him into the
inner apartments and served him with refreshments. The ladies of the family saluted the
Master.
The devotees were singing kirtan in the drawing-room, awaiting the Master's coming.
Presently Sri Ramakrishna came and joined the singers.
The kirtan went on:
Behold, my Gora is dancing! With the devotees
He dances in Srivas's courtyard, singing the kirtan.
Gora says to all, "Repeat the name of Hari!"
He looks at Gadadhar, and from his red eyes
Are flowing tears of love over his golden body.
The Master improvised the lines:
Gora is dancing in the kirtan:
There he dances, Sachi's darling!
There he dances, my Gaurānga!
There he dances, my soul's beloved!
--------------------
539Chapter 26
FESTIVAL AT ADHAR'S HOUSE
Sunday, August 3, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room in the temple garden at Dakshineswar after
his midday meal. A party of Bauls from Shibpur, several devotees from Bhawanipur,
Balarām, and M. were in the room. Rākhāl, Lātu, and Harish were then living with the
Master. They too were present.
The Master began the conversation by addressing the Baul musicians from Shibpur.
Yoga and the six centres
MASTER: "Yoga is not possible if the mind dwells on 'woman and gold'. The mind of a
worldly man generally moves among the three lower centres: those at the navel, at the
sexual organ, and at the organ of evacuation. After great effort and spiritual practice
the Kundalini is awakened. According to the yogis there are three nerves in the spinal
column: Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna. Along the Sushumna are six lotuses, or centres,
the lowest being known as the Muladhara. Then come successively Svadhisthana,
Manipura, Anāhata, Visuddha, and Ājnā. These are the six centres. The Kundalini, when
awakened, passes through the lower centres and comes to the Anāhata, which is at the
heart. It stays there. At that time the mind of the aspirant is withdrawn from the three
lower centres. He feels the awakening of Divine Consciousness and sees Light. In mute
wonder he sees that radiance and cries out: 'What is this? What is this?'
"After passing through the six centres, the Kundalini reaches the thousand petalled lotus
known as the Sahasrara, and the aspirant goes into samādhi.
"According to the Vedas these centres are called 'bhumi', 'planes'. There are seven such
planes. The centre at the heart corresponds to the fourth plane of the Vedas. According
to the Tantra there is in this centre a lotus called Anāhata, with twelve petals.
"The centre known as Visuddha is the fifth plane. This centre is at the throat and has a
lotus with sixteen petals. When the Kundalini reaches this plane, the devotee longs to
talk and hear only about God. Conversation on worldly subjects, on 'woman and gold',
causes him great pain. He leaves a place where people talk of these matters.
"Then comes the sixth plane, corresponding to the centre known as Ājnā. This centre is
located between the eyebrows and it has a lotus with two petals. When the Kundalini
reaches it, the aspirant sees the form of God. But still there remains a slight barrier
between the devotee and God. It is like a light inside a lantern. You may think you
have touched the light, but in reality you cannot because of the barrier of glass.
"And last of all is the seventh plane, which, according to Tantra, is the centre of the
thousand-petalled lotus. When the Kundalini arrives there, the aspirant goes into
540samādhi. In that lotus dwells Satchidananda Shiva, the Absolute. There Kundalini, the
awakened Power, unites with Shiva. This is known as the union of Shiva and Śakti.
The state of samādhi
"When the Kundalini rises to the Sahasrara and the mind goes into samādhi, the aspirant
loses all consciousness of the outer world. He can no longer retain his physical body. If
milk is poured into his mouth, it runs out again. In that state the life-breath lingers for
twenty-one days and then passes out. Entering the 'black waters' of the ocean, the ship
never comes back. But the Isvarakotis, such as the Incarnations of God, can come down
from this state of samādhi. They can descend from this exalted state because they like
to live in the company of devotees and enjoy the love of God. God retains in them the
'ego of Knowledge' or the 'ego of Devotion' so that they may teach men. Their minds
move between the sixth and the seventh planes. They run a boat-race back and forth,
as it were, between these two planes.
Keeping individuality after samādhi
"After attaining samādhi some souls of their own accord keep the 'ego of Knowledge'.
But that ego does not create any attachment. It is like a line drawn on the water.
"Hanuman kept the 'servant ego' after realizing God in both His Personal and His
Impersonal aspects. He thought of himself as the servant of God. The great sages,
such as Nārada, Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumāra, after attaining the
Knowledge of Brahman, kept the 'servant ego' and the 'ego of Devotion'. They are like
big steamships, which not only cross the ocean themselves but carry many passengers
to the other shore.
Two classes of Paramahamsas
"There are two classes of paramahamsas, one affirming the formless Reality and the
other affirming God with form. Trailanga Swami believed in the formless Reality.
Paramahamsas like him care for their own good alone; they feel satisfied if they
themselves attain the goal.
Paramahamsas as teachers of men
"But those paramahamsas who believe in God with form keep the love of God even after
attaining the Knowledge of Brahman, so that they may teach spiritual truth to others.
They are like a pitcher brimful of water. Part of the water may be poured into another
pitcher. These perfected souls describe to others the various spiritual disciplines by
which they have realized God. They do this only to teach others and to help them in
spiritual life. With great effort men dig a well for drinking water, using spades and
baskets for the purpose. After the digging is over, some throw the spades and other
implements into the well, not needing them any more. But some put them away near
the well, so that others may use them.
"Some eat mangoes secretly and remove all trace of them by wiping their mouths with a
towel. But some share the fruit with others. There are sages who, even after attaining
541Knowledge, work to help others and also to enjoy the Bliss of God in the company of
devotees. 'I want to eat sugar. I don't want to be sugar.'
"The Gopis of Vrindāvan, too, attained the Knowledge of Brahman; but they were not
seeking It. They wanted to enjoy God, looking on themselves as His mother, His friend,
His handmaid, or His lover."
The Bauls from Shibpur began to sing to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument. A
line in the first song was:
We are sinners: redeem us, O merciful Lord!
MASTER (to the devotees): "It is the attitude of a beginner to worship God out of fear.
Please sing about God-realization-songs expressing divine joy.
(To Rākhāl ) "How well they sang that song the other day at Nabin Niyogi's house: 'Be
drunk, O mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss'! While singing religious songs
one should not constantly refer to one's worries. One should rather feel joyous and
ecstatic as one chants God's name.
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, won't you sing?"
MASTER: "What shall I sing? Well, I may sing when the spirit moves me."
Master sings of divine joy
After a few minutes the Master began to sing. His eyes were turned upward.
He sang:
Behold the waves of Gora's ecstatic love;
Under them all the universe lies submerged!
And in his love I, too, long to be drowned.
O friend, Gaurānga's love has swallowed me;
Who else feels for our misery like Gaurānga,
Dragging us from the mire of worldliness?
He sang again:
Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty;
If you descend to the uttermost depths,
There you will find the gem of Love. . . .
Then he sang about the Divine Mother:
Can everyone have the vision of Syama?
Is Kāli's treasure for everyone?
Oh, what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true! . . .
He continued:
542The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet. . . .
And again:
O Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made!
What pranks Thou playest with this toy
Three and a half cubits high! . . .
As Sri Ramakrishna sang the last song he went into samādhi. The devotees sat
speechless, gazing at his radiant figure. After some time he regained partial
consciousness of the world and began to talk to the Divine Mother.
The Master said, "Mother, please come down from up there." Did he feel his mind still
lingering in the seventh plane of consciousness, the thousand petalled lotus of the
Sahasrara? "Please do come down", he said. "Don't torment me that way. Be still,
Mother, and sit down.
"O Mother, everybody's future is determined by the tendencies of his previous births.
What shall I say to these people? Nothing can be achieved without discrimination and
renunciation."
Renunciation, true and false
Sri Ramakrishna had now regained full consciousness of the world, and he continued:
"There are many kinds of renunciation. One of them may be called 'Markata Vairāgya',
'Monkey Renunciation'. It is a false renunciation stimulated by the afflictions of the
world. That renunciation doesn't last long. Then there is real renunciation. A man with
everything in the world, lacking nothing, feels all to be unreal.
"It is not possible to acquire renunciation all at once. The time factor must be taken into
account. But it is also true that a man should hear about it. When the right time comes,
he will say to himself, 'Oh yes, I heard about this.'
"You must also remember another thing. By constantly hearing about renunciation one's
desire for worldly objects gradually wears away. One should take rice-water in small
doses to get rid of the intoxication of liquor. Then one gradually becomes normal.
"An aspirant entitled to the Knowledge of God is very rare. It is said in the Gitā that one
in thousands desires to know God, and again, that among thousands who have such a
desire, only one is able to know Him."
A devotee quoted the text from the Gitā.
MASTER: "As your attachment to the world diminishes, your spiritual knowledge will
increase. Attachment to the world means attachment to 'woman and gold'.
Prema, the rarest love of God
"It is not given to everybody to feel prema, ecstatic love of God. Chaitanya experienced
it. An ordinary man can at the most experience bhava. Only the Isvarakotis, such as
543Divine Incarnations, experience prema. When prema is awakened the devotee not only
feels the world to be unreal, but forgets even the body, which everyone loves so
intensely.
"In a Persian book it is said that inside the skin is the flesh, inside the flesh the bone,
inside the bone the marrow, and so on, but that prema is the innermost of all. One
becomes soft and tender through prema. On account of this prema, Krishna became
tribhanga.
"Prema is the rope by which you can tether God, as it were. Whenever you want to see
Him you have merely to pull the rope. Whenever you call Him, He will appear before
you.
"The mature stage of bhakti is bhava. When one attains it one remains speechless,
thinking of Satchidananda. The feeling of an ordinary man can go only that far. When
bhava ripens it becomes mahabhava. Prema is the last. You know the difference
between a green mango and a ripe one. Unalloyed love of God is the essential thing. All
else is unreal.
"Once Rāma was pleased with the prayer of Nārada and told him to ask for a boon.
Nārada prayed for pure love and said further, 'O Rāma, please grant that I may not be
deluded by Thy world-bewitching māyā.' Rāma said: 'That is all right. But ask for
something else.' Nārada replied: 'I don't want anything else. I pray only for pure love.'
How to attain pure love of God
"How can a devotee attain such love? First, the company of holy men. That awakens
śraddhā, faith in God. Then comes nishtha, single-minded devotion to the Ideal. In that
stage the devotee does not like to hear anything but talk about God. He performs only
those acts that please God. After nishtha comes bhakti, devotion to God; then comes
bhava. Next mahabhava, then prema, and last of all the attainment of God Himself.
Only for Isvarakotis, such as the Incarnations, is it possible to have mahabhava or
prema.
How to attain pure love of God
"The knowledge of a worldly person, the knowledge of a devotee, and the Knowledge of
an Incarnation are by no means of the same degree. The knowledge of a worldly person
is like the light of an oil lamp, which shows only the inside of a room. Through such
knowledge he eats and drinks, attends to household duties, protects his body, brings up
his children, and so on.
"The knowledge of a devotee is like the light of the moon, which illumines objects both
inside and outside a room. But such light does not enable him to see a distant or a very
minute object.
"The Knowledge of an Incarnation of God is like the light of the sun. Through that light
the Incarnation sees everything, inside and outside, big and small.
544"The mind of a worldly person is, no doubt, like muddy water; but it can be made clear
by a purifying agent. Discrimination and renunciation are the purifying agent."
The Master spoke to the devotees from Shibpur.
MASTER: "Have you any questions to ask?"
A DEVOTEE: "We have listened to your words."
The time factor in spiritual progress
MASTER: "Yes, it is good to listen to these things. But nothing will happen except at the
right time. What can quinine do for a fever patient when he runs a high temperature?
Only when his temperature comes down through the use of 'fever mixture' or a
purgative should quinine be prescribed. There are patients who get rid of their fever
even without quinine. A child said to his mother, when he was put to bed, 'Mother,
please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' The mother said: 'My child, I shall not
have to wake you. The urge itself will wake you.'
"Different kinds of people come here. 'Some come by boat with the devotees. But they
do not enjoy spiritual talk. They keep nudging their friends and whispering: 'When shall
we leave here? When are we going?' If the friends show no sign of getting up, they say,
'We would rather wait for you in the boat.'
"Those who have a human body for the first time need the experience of sense
enjoyments. Spiritual consciousness is not awakened unless certain duties have been
performed."
The Master was going to the pine-grove. With a smile he said to M., on the semicircular
porch, "Well, what do you think of my state of mind?"
M. (smiling): "On the surface you are very simple, but inwardly very deep.
extremely difficult to understand you."
It is
MASTER (smiling): "True. It is like the cement floor of a house. People see only the
outer surface and do not know how many materials there are under it."
It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Balarām and several other devotees got into
a country boat to return to Calcutta. It was ebb-tide in the Ganges. A gentle breeze
was blowing from the south, covering the bosom of the sacred river with ripples.
M. looked at the scene a long time. As the boat disappeared in the direction of Calcutta,
he came back to the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was going to the pine-grove. A beautiful, dark rain-cloud was to be
seen in the northwest. The Master asked M.: "Do you think it will rain? Please bring my
umbrella." M. brought the umbrella. Reaching the Panchavati, the Master said to Lātu,
who also accompanied him, "Why do you look so sickly?"
545LĀTU: "I can hardly eat anything."
MASTER: "Is that the only reason? It is also a bad time of the year. Are you meditating
too much? (To M.) I have a request to make of you. Please tell Baburam to stay with
me a day or two during Rākhāl 's absence. Otherwise I shall feel very unhappy."
M: "Yes, sir. I shall tell him."
Sri Ramakrishna asked M. whether he thought that Baburam was guileless.
Presently the Master left them, going in the direction of the pine-trees. After a few
minutes M. and Lātu, standing in the Panchavati, saw the Master coming back toward
them. Behind him the sky was black with the rain-cloud. Its reflection in the Ganges
made the water darker. The disciples felt that the Master was God Incarnate, a Divine
Child five years old, radiant with the smile of innocence and purity. Around him were
the sacred trees of the Panchavati under which he had practised spiritual discipline and
had beheld visions of God. At his feet flowed the sacred river Ganges, the destroyer of
man's sins. The presence of this God-man charged the trees, shrubs, flowers, plants,
and temples with spiritual fervour and divine joy.
Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room and sat on the small couch. He began to praise a
medicine that a certain brahmachari had prepared for him. Referring to this man, Hazra
said: "He is now entangled in many worldly anxieties. What a shame! Look at Nabai
Chaitanya of Konnagar. Though a householder, he has put on a red cloth."
MASTER: "What shall I say? I clearly see that it is God Himself who has assumed all
these human forms. Therefore I cannot take anybody to task."
HAZRA: "Narendra is again involved in a lawsuit."
MASTER: "He doesn't believe in Śakti, the Divine Mother. If one assumes a human
body, one must recognize Her."
HAZRA: "Narendra says: 'If I believed in Śakti, all would follow me. Therefore I cannot.'"
MASTER: "But it is not good for him to go to the extreme of denying the Divine Mother.
He is now under Śakti's jurisdiction. Even a judge, while giving evidence in a case,
comes down and stands in the witness-box.
(To M.) "Have you seen Narendra lately?"
M: "Not during the last few days."
MASTER: "See him and bring him here in a carriage.
(To Hazra) "Well, what is his relation to this [meaning himself]?"
546HAZRA: "He expects help from you."
MASTER: "And what about Bhavanath? Would he come here so frequently if he didn't
have good tendencies? What about Harish and Lātu? They always meditate. Why is
that?"
HAZRA: "That's right. Why should they devote all their time to meditation? It is quite a
different thing for them to stay here to attend to your personal needs."
MASTER: "Possibly you are right. Perhaps others may take their place now."
Hazra left the room, leaving the Master alone with M.
MASTER: "Does what I say in the state of ecstasy attract people?"
M: "Oh, yes. Very much."
MASTER: "What do people think of me? Do they think anything in particular about me
when they see me in that condition?"
M: "We feel in you a wonderful synthesis of knowledge, love, and renunciation, and on
the surface a natural spontaneity. Many divine experiences have passed, like huge
steamboats, through the deep of your inner consciousness; still you maintain outwardly
this utter simplicity. Many cannot understand it, but a few are attracted by this state
alone."
MASTER: "There is a sect of Vaishriavas known as the Ghoshpara, who describe God as
the 'Sahaja', the 'Simple One'. They say further that a man cannot recognize this
'Simple One' unless he too is simple. (To M.) Have I any ego?"
M: "Yes, sir. A little. You have kept it to preserve your body, and to enjoy divine love in
the company of the devotees and impart spiritual knowledge to them. Further, you have
kept this trace of ego by praying to the Divine Mother for it."
MASTER: "No. I have not kept it. It is God Himself who has left it in me. Can you tell
me how I appear in the state of samādhi?"
M: "As you said a little while ago, you see the form of God when your mind rises to the
'sixth plane'. When you speak after that, your mind comes down to the 'fifth plane'."
MASTER: "It is God who does all these things. I do not know anything."
M: "That is why you attract people so much. Sir, I have a question to ask. There are
two opinions in the scriptures. According to one, Purana, Krishna is Chidatma, the
Absolute, and Radha is ChitŚakti, Its Divine Power; but according to another, Krishna
Himself is Kāli; the Primordial Energy."
547MASTER: "This second view is held in the Devi Purana. According to it, Kāli Herself has
become Krishna; But what difference does it make? God is infinite, and infinite are the
ways to reach Him."
M. remained speechless with wonder for a few moments and then said: "Oh, now I
understand. As you say, the important thing is to climb to the roof. Our goal will be
achieved if we can accomplish it by following any of the means-a rope or a pole."
MASTER: "It is through the grace of God that you have understood that. Without His
grace doubt is never cleared up.
Master teaches M
"The important thing is somehow to cultivate devotion to God and love for Him. What is
the use of knowing many things? It is enough to cultivate love of God by following any of
the paths. When you have this love, you are sure to attain God. Afterwards, if it is
necessary, God will explain everything to you and tell you about the other paths as well.
It is enough for you to develop love of God. You have no need of many opinions and
discussions. You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Enjoy them to your heart's
content. You don't need to count the branches and leaves on the trees. It is wise to
follow the attitude of Hanuman: 'I do not know the day of the week, the phase of the
moon, or the position of the stars; I only contemplate Rāma.' "
M: "I now desire that my activities may be much reduced and that I may devote myself
greatly to God."
MASTER: "Ah! Certainly your desire will be fulfilled. But a Jnāni can live unattached in
the world."
M: "True, sir. But one needs special power to lead an unattached life."
MASTER: "That is also true. But perhaps you wanted the worldly life. Krishna had been
enshrined in Radha's heart; but Radha wanted to sport with Him in human form. Hence
all the episodes of Vrindāvan. Now you should pray to God that your worldly duties may
be reduced. And you will achieve the goal if you renounce mentally."
M: "But mental renunciation is prescribed for those who cannot give up the world
outwardly. For superior devotees total renunciation is enjoined-both outer and inner."
Sri Ramakrishna was silent a few minutes and then resumed the conversation.
MASTER: "How did you like what I said about renunciation a little while ago?"
M: "Very much, sir."
MASTER: "Tell me, what is the meaning of renunciation?"
548M: "Renunciation does not mean simply dispassion for the world. It means dispassion
for the world and also longing for God."
MASTER: "You are right. You no doubt need money for your worldly life; but don't worry
too much about it. The wise course is to accept what comes of its own accord. Don't
take too much trouble to save money. Those who surrender their hearts and souls to
God, those who are devoted to Him and have taken refuge in Him, do not worry much
about money. As they earn, so they spend. The money comes in one way and goes out
the other. This is what the Gitā describes as 'accepting what comes of its own accord'."
The Master referred to Haripada and said, "He came here the other day."
M: "He knows how to sing the stories of the Purana. He sings melodiously about the life
of Prahlada and the nativity of Sri Krishna."
MASTER: "Is that so? That day I looked into his eyes. They had an inward look. I asked
him whether he meditated a great deal, but he sat with his eyes cast down and didn't
answer. Then I said to him, 'Look here, don't strain yourself too much.' "
It was now dusk. Sri Ramakrishna, as was usual with him during this part of the day,
chanted the names of God and turned his mind to contemplation. Soon the moon rose
in the sky. The temples, courtyards, and trees were bathed in its silvery light, and
millions of broken moons played on the rippling surface of the Ganges. Rākhāl and M.
were with the Master in his room.
MASTER (to M.): "Baburam says, 'Oh, the worldly life! God forbid!' "
M: "His opinion is based on mere hearsay. What does he know of the world? He is a
mere child."
MASTER: "Yes, that is true. Have you noticed Niranjan? He is utterly artless."
M: "Yes, sir. His very appearance attracts people. How expressive his eyes are!"
MASTER: "Not only his eyes, but his entire person. His relatives proposed that he
marry. At this he said, 'Why are you going to drown me?' (With a smile) Tell me this.
People say that a man finds great pleasure in the company of his wife after the hard
work of the day."
M: "That is no doubt true of those who think that way. (To Rākhāl, with a smile) We are
now being examined. This is a leading question."
Both Rākhāl and M. were married.
MASTER (with a smile): "A mother says, 'I shall heave a sigh of relief if I can procure a
"shade-tree" for my son. He will rest in its shade when scorched by the heat of the
world.' "
549M: "True, sir. But there are parents and parents. A father who is spiritually illumined
doesn't give his children in marriage. If he does, his is a fine spirituality!"
Adhar Sen arrived from Calcutta and saluted the Master. After a few minutes, he went
to the temple of Kāli, where M. followed him.
A little later M. was sitting at the Bathing-Ghat on the Ganges. The flood tide had just
set in. As he listened to the waters lapping against the bank, many pictures of Sri
Ramakrishna's divine life flitted before his mind: the Master's deep samādhi, his constant
ecstasy, his joy in the love of God, his untiring discourse on spiritual life, his genuine
love for the devotees, and, above all, his childlike simplicity. Who was this man? Was it
God who had embodied Himself on earth for the sake of His devotees?
Adhar and M. returned to the Master's room. Adhar had been to Chittagong, in East
Bengal, on official duty. He was telling the Master about his visit to the Chandranath
Hills and Sitakunda, sacred places of Chittagong.
ADHAR: "Near Sitakunda I visited a well where I saw fire in the water. It is always
burning on the water with leaping tongues."
MASTER: "How is that possible?"
ADHAR: "The water contains phosphorus."
Presently Ram Chatterji entered the room. The Master said some kind words about him
to Adhar.
MASTER: "Ram's presence in the temple garden has relieved us of many anxieties. He
searches out Harish, Lātu, and the others at meal-time. Very often they are absorbed in
meditation in some corner of the temple garden. It is Ram who sees that they eat at the
proper time."

Master at Adhar's house
About three o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was seated in Adhar's parlour on
the second floor. Narendra, the Mukherji brothers, Bhavanath, M., Hazra, and other
devotees were with the Master.
Arrangements were being made for Narendra to sing: While he was tuning the Tānpura,
one of the strings snapped, and the Master exclaimed, "Oh! What have you done?"
Narendra then tuned the drums. The Master said to him, "You are beating that drum,
and I feel as if someone were slapping my cheek."
Referring to the Kirtan, Narendra said: 'There is not much rhythm in the Kirtan. That's
why it is so popular and people love it so much."
MASTER: "How silly! People like it because it is so tender and full of pathos."
550Narendra's music
Narendra sang:
Sweet is Thy name, a Refuge of the humble!
It falls like sweetest nectar on our ears
And comforts us, Beloved of our souls! . . .
He sang again:
O Lord, must all my days pass by so utterly in vain?
Down the path of hope I gaze with longing, day and night.
Thou art the Lord of all the worlds, and I but a beggar here;
How can I ask of Thee to come and dwell within my heart?
My poor heart's humble cottage door is standing open wide;
Be gracious, Lord, and enter there but once, and quench its
thirst!
MASTER (to Hazra, smiling): "That was the first song he sang for me."
Narendra sang one or two more songs. Then Vaishnavcharan sang, describing the grief
of the gopis at the sight of Krishna as king of Mathura:
O Hari, how shall we know You now?
In Mathura's royal splendour You have forgotten us. . . .
MASTER: "Won't you sing that one- 'O Vina, sing Lord Hari's name?"
Vaishnavcharan sang:
O Vina, sing Lord Hari's name!
Without the blessing of His feet
You cannot know the final Truth.
The name of Hari slays all grief:
Sing Hari's name! Sing Krishna's name!
If only Hari shows His grace,
Then I shall never be distressed.
O Vina, sing His name but once;
No earthly gem is half so rare.
Govinda says: In vain my days
Have passed. No longer may I float
Here in life's trackless ocean waste!
While listening to the song, the Master became abstracted. Saying "Ah me! Ah me!" he
went into samādhi. The devotees were sitting around him, their eyes riveted on him.
The room was filled with people.
Master in ecstasy
The musician sang again. As he improvised new lines describing ecstatic love of God,
the Master stood up and danced. He himself improvised lines and sang them with
outstretched arms. Soon he went into samādhi and sat down, with his head resting on
the bolster in front of him. The musician was also carried away with emotion and sang
551new songs. Sri Ramakrishna again stood up and began to dance. The devotees could
not control themselves. They too danced with the Master. While dancing, Sri
Ramakrishna every now and then went into deep samādhi. When he was in the deepest
samādhi he could not utter a word and his whole body remained transfixed. The
devotees danced encircling him. After a while, regaining partial consciousness, he
danced with the strength of a lion, intoxicated with ecstatic love. But even then he could
not utter a word. Finally, regaining more of the consciousness of the world, he sang
again, improvising the lines. An intense spiritual atmosphere was created in Adhar's
parlour. At the sound of the loud music a large crowd had gathered in the street.
Sri Ramakrishna danced a long time in the company of the devotees. When he resumed
his seat, still tinged with the lingering glow of divine fervour, he asked Narendra to sing
"O Mother, make me mad with Thy love".
Narendra sang:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .
MASTER: "And that one― 'Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness'."
Narendra sang:
Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness waves of ecstatic love
arise:
Rapture divine! Play of God's Bliss!
Oh, how enthralling! . . .
MASTER: "And that one too― 'In Wisdom's firmament'. Perhaps it is too long. Do you
think so? All right, sing it slowly."
Narendra sang:
In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full,
And Love's flood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.
O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . .
MASTER: "And won't you sing that one― The Wine of Heavenly Bliss' ?"
Narendra sang:
Be drunk, O mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss!
Roll on the ground and weep, chanting Hari's sweet name!
Fill the arching heavens with your deep lion roar,
Singing Hari's sweet name! With both your arms upraised,
Dance in the name of Hari and give His name to all.
Swim by day and by night in the b1iss of Hari's love;
Slay desire with His name, and blessed be your life!
552The Master improvised, "Be drunk with prema and weep, chanting Hari's sweet name." And,
"Be mad with divine fervour and weep, chanting His name."
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees rested awhile. Narendra said to the Master in a low
voice, "Will you kindly sing that one?"
MASTER: "My voice has become a little hoarse."
After a few minutes he asked Narendra, "Which one?"
NARENDRA: "Gaur, whose beauty delights the world."
Sri Ramakrishna sang, describing the beauty of Sri Chaitanya:
Who has brought Gaur to Nadia
Gaur, whose beauty delights the world?
His face, covered with ringlets of hair,
Shines like lightning against a dark cloud. . . .
Again he sang, this time about the grief of a Gopi at her separation from Sri Krishna:
I have not found my Krishna, O friend! How cheerless my home
without Him!
Ah, if Krishna could only be the hair upon my head,
Carefully I should braid it then, and deck it with bakul-flowers;
Carefully I should fashion the braids out of my Krishna-hair.
Krishna is black, and black is my hair; black would be one with
black.
Ah, if Krishna could only be the ring I wear in my nose,
Always from my nose He would hang, and my two lips could
touch Him.
But it can never be, alas! Why should I idly dream?
Why should Krishna care at all to be the ring in my nose?
Ah, if Krishna could only be the bracelets on my arms,
Always He would cling to my wrists, and proudly I should walk,
Shaking my bracelets to make them sound, shaking my arms to
show them;
Down the king's highway I should walk, wearing my Krishna
bracelets.
The music was over. The Master began to talk with the devotees.
MASTER (smiling): "Hazra danced."
NARENDRA: "Yes, a little."
MASTER: "A little?"
553NARENDRA: "Yes. His belly danced too." (All laugh.)
Pundit Shashadhar's host had been thinking of inviting the Master for dinner.
MASTER: "I have heard that his host is not an honest man. He is immoral."
NARENDRA: "That is why you didn't drink the water he touched. It happened the first
day you met Shashadhar at his house. How did you come to know he was immoral?"
MASTER (smiling): "Hazra knows of another instance. It happened at Sihore in Hriday's
house."
HAZRA: "The man was a Vaishnava. He came with me to see you [meaning Sri
Ramakrishna]. As soon as he sat in front of you, you turned your back on him."
MASTER: "We learnt later that he led an immoral life. (To Narendra) You used to say, at
first, that these were all hallucinations."
NARENDRA: "How was I to know? Now I see that you are always right."
Adhar had prepared a feast for the Master and the devotees, and now he invited them to
the meal. The Master said to the Mukherji brothers: "What? Won't you eat?" They said
humbly, "Please excuse us."
MASTER: "But why? You are doing everything else. Why this hesitation only about
eating the meal?"
Adhar was a low-caste Hindu. Therefore some of the Master's brahmin devotees
hesitated to eat at his house. They came to their senses at last when they saw Sri
Ramakrishna himself eating.
It was about nine o'clock. The Master was resting in the drawing-room with the
devotees. He would soon leave for Dakshineswar.
The Mukherji brothers had arranged with a singer of Kirtan to entertain the Master the
following day. Ram was taking singing lessons from this musician. Sri Ramakrishna
asked Narendra to come to Dakshineswar to hear the Kirtan.
MASTER (to Narendra): "Come tomorrow, won't you?"
NARENDRA: "I shall try, sir."
MASTER: "You can bathe there and also take your meal. (Pointing to M.) He may dine
there too. (To M.) Are you quite well now? I hope you are not on a diet."
M: "No, sir. I shall come."
554Nityagopal was living at Vrindāvan. Chunilal had returned from Vrindāvan only a few
days before, and the Master inquired about Nityagopal.
As Sri Ramakrishna was about to leave, M. saluted him, touching the Master's feet with
his forehead. The Master said to him tenderly: "Then I shall see you tomorrow.
Narendra! Bhavanath! Please come tomorrow." Then with several devotees he set out for
Dakshineswar.
The other devotees returned home in the moonlit night, cherishing in their hearts the
Master's ecstatic music and dancing.
--------------------
555Chapter 27
AT DAKSHINESWAR
Sunday, September 7, 1884
IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar.
He had not yet taken his midday meal.
Arrangements had been made with the musician Shyamdas to entertain the Master and
the devotees with his kirtan. Baburam, M., Manomohan, Bhavanath, Kishori, Chunilal,
Haripada, the Mukherji brothers, Ram, Surendra, Tārak, Niranjan, and others arrived at
the temple garden. Lātu, Harish, and Hazra were staying with the Master.
When M. saluted Sri Ramakrishna, the Master asked: "Where is Narendra? Isn't he
coming?" M. told him that Narendra could not come.
A brahmin devotee was reading to the Master from a book of devotional songs by
Ramprasad. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to continue. The brahmin read a song, the first
line of which was: "O Mother, put on Thy clothes."
MASTER: "Stop, please! These ideas are outlandish and bizarre. Read something that will
awaken bhakti."
The brahmin read:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. . . .
MASTER (to M.): "I got a pain because I lay too long on one side while in samādhi
yesterday at Adhar's house; so now I'll take Baburam with me when I visit the houses of
the devotees. He is a sympathetic soul"
With these words the Master sang:
How shall I open my heart,O friend?
It is forbidden me to speak.
I am about to die, for lack of a kindred soul
To understand my misery.
Simply by looking in his eyes,
I find the beloved of my heart;
But rare is such a soul, who swims in ecstatic bliss
On the high tide of heavenly love.
MASTER: "The Bauls sing songs like that. They also sing another kind of song:
556Stay your steps, O wandering monk!
Stand there with begging-bowl in hand,
And let me behold your radiant face.
Signs of a perfect soul
"According to the Śakti cult the siddha is called a koul, and according to the Vedānta, a
paramahamsa. The Bauls call him a sai. They say, 'No one is greater than a sai.' The sai
is a man of supreme perfection. He doesn't see any differentiation in the world. He wears
a necklace, one half made of cow bones and the other of the sacred tulsi-plant. He calls
the Ultimate Truth 'Ālekh', the 'Incomprehensible One'. The Vedas call It 'Brahman'.
About the jivas the Bauls say, 'They come from Ālekh and they go unto Ālekh.'
That is to say, the individual soul has come from the Unmanifest and goes back to the
Unmanifest. The Bauls will ask you, 'Do you know about the wind?' The 'wind' means the
great currrent that one feels in the subtle nerves, Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, when the
Kundalini is awakened. They will ask you further, 'In which station are you dwelling?'
According to them there are six 'stations', corresponding to the six psychic centres of
Yoga. If they say that a man dwells in the 'fifth station', it means that his mind has
climbed to the fifth centre, known as the Viśuddha chakra. (To M.) At that time he sees
the Formless."
Saying this the Master sang:
Within the petals of this flower there lies concealed a subtle
space,
Transcending which, one sees at length the universe in Space
dissolve.
Description of the Bauls
"Once a Baul came here. I asked him, 'Have you finished the task of "refining the
syrup"? Have you taken the pot off the stove?' The more you boil the juice of sugar-
cane, the more it is refined. In the first stage of boiling it is simply the juice of the
sugar-cane. Next it is molasses, then sugar, then sugar candy, and so on. As it goes on
boiling, the substances you get are more and more refined.
"When does a man take the pot off the stove? That is, when does a man come to the
end of his sadhana? He comes to the end when he has acquired complete mastery over
his sense-organs. His sense-organs become loosened and powerless, as the leech is
loosened from the body when you put lime on its mouth. In that state a man may live
with a woman, but he does not feel any lust for her.
"Many of the Bauls follow a 'dirty' method of spiritual discipline. It is like entering a
house through the back door by which the scavengers come.
"One day I was taking my meal when a Bāul devotee arrived. He asked me, 'Are you
yourself eating, or are you feeding someone else?' The meaning of his words was that
557the siddha sees God dwelling within a man. The siddhas among the Bauls will not talk to
persons of another sect; they call them 'strangers'.
"The Bauls designate the state of perfection as the 'sahaja', the 'natural' state. There are
two signs of this state. First, a perfect man will not 'smell of Krishna'. Second, he is like
the bee that lights on the lotus but does not sip the honey. The first means, that he
keeps all his spiritual feelings within himself. He doesn't show outwardly any sign of
spirituality. He doesn't even utter the name of Hari. The second means that he is not
attached to woman. He has completely mastered his senses.
"The Bauls do not like the worship of an image. They want a living man. That is why one
of their sects is called the Kartabhaja. They worship the karta, that is to say, the guru,
as God.
Different paths leading to God
"You see how many opinions there are about God. Each opinion is a path. There are
innumerable opinions and innumerable paths leading to God."
BHAVANATH: "Then what should we do?"
Devotion to one's own path and respect for others'
MASTER: "You must stick to one path with all your strength. A man can reach the roof of
a house by stone stairs or a ladder or a rope-ladder or a rope or even by a bamboo pole.
But he cannot reach the roof if he sets foot now on one and now on another. He should
firmly follow one path. Likewise, in order to realize God a man must follow one path with
all his strength.
"But you must regard other views as so many paths leading to God. You should not feel
that your path is the only right path and that other paths are wrong. You mustn't bear
malice toward others.
"Well, to what path do I belong? Keshab Sen used to say to me: 'You belong to our path.
You are gradually accepting the ideal of the formless God.' Shashadhar says that I
belong to his path. Vijay, too, says that I belong to his―Vijay's― path."
The tides in the Ganges
Sri Ramakrishna walked toward the Panchavati with M. and a few other devotees. It was
midday and time for the flood-tide in the Ganges.
They waited in the Panchavati to see the bore of the tide.
MASTER (to the devotees): "The ebb-tide and flood-tide are indeed amazing. But notice
one thing. Near the sea you see ebb-tide and flood-tide in a river, but far away from the
sea the river flows in one direction only. What does this mean? Try to apply its
significance to your spiritual life. Those who live very near God feel within them the
558currents of bhakti, bhava, and the like. In the case of a few―the Isvarakotis, for
instance―one sees even mahabhava and prema.
(To M.) "What is the explanation of the ebb-tide and flood-tide?"
M: "According to Western astronomy, they are due to the attraction of the sun and the
moon."
In order to explain it, M. drew figures on the earth and began to show the Master the
movement of the earth, the sun, and the moon.
The Master looked at the figures for a minute and said: "Stop, please! It gives me a
headache."
Presently the tide came up the Ganges. They heard the sound of the rushing water. The
tide struck the bank of the river and flowed toward the north. Sri Ramakrishna looked at
it intently and exclaimed like a child: "Look at that boat! I wonder what is going to
happen to it."
The Master and M. sat down for a while in the Panchavati, Sri Ramakrishna placing his
umbrella on the cement platform. The conversation turned to Narayan. The boy was a
student. Sri Ramakrishna looked upon him as Narayana, God Himself, and was very fond
of him.
MASTER: "Have you noticed Naran's nature? He can mix with all, old and young. One
cannot do this without a special power.
Besides, all love him. Is he really artless?"
M: "I think so."
MASTER: "I understand that he goes to your place. Is that so?"
M: "Yes, sir. He has visited me once or twice."
MASTER: "Will you give him a rupee? Or shall I ask Kāli about it?"
M: "Very well, sir. I shall give him the money."
MASTER: "That's fine. It is good to help those who yearn for God. Thus one makes good
use of one's money. What will you gain by spending everything on your family?"
Kishori had several children. His salary was too small to support his family. Sri
Ramakrishna said to M.: "Naran said he would get a job for Kishori. Please remind him of
it."
559The Master walked away in the direction of the pine-grove. Returning to the Panchavati,
he said to M.: "Please ask someone to spread a mat outside my room. I shall lie down a
few minutes. I am coming presently."
When the Master returned to his room, he could not find his umbrella and exclaimed:
"You have all forgotten the umbrella! The busybody doesn't see a thing even when it is
very near him. A man went to a friend's house to light the charcoal for his smoke,
though all the time he had a lighted lantern in his hand. Another man looked everywhere
for his towel. Finally he discovered that it had been on his shoulder all the time."
It was about one o'clock in the afternoon. The Master ate the prasad from the Kāli
temple. Then he wanted to rest awhile, but the devotees were still sitting in his room.
They were asked to go out, and then the Master lay down. He said to Baburam, "Come
here; sit near me." Baburam answered, "I am preparing betel-leaf." The Master said,"Put
your betel-leaf aside"
The devotees sat under the bakul-tree in the Panchavati. Tārak, who had just returned
from Vrindāvan, told them stories of his visit.
A little later Sri Ramakrishna was seated again on his couch, the devotees sitting on the
floor. Shyamdas was singing with his party.
He sang of the gopis' grief at their separation from Sri Krishna:
Dry as a desert seemed the happy lake to them:
The chatak died of thirst, gazing toward the clouds.
The Master became somewhat abstracted, but the musician could not create a spiritual
atmosphere. Sri Ramakrishna asked Nabai of Konnagar to sing a kirtan. Nabai was
Manomohan's uncle. He lived on the bank of the Ganges, devoting his time to prayer and
meditation, and was a frequent visitor of Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar.
Master in ecstasy
Nabai began the kirtan in a loud voice. The Master left the couch and began to dance.
Immediately Nabai and other devotees began to dance around him. The atmosphere
became intense with spiritual fervour.
After the kirtan, Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat. With great feeling he began to sing
of the Divine Mother, his eyes turned upward:
O Mother, ever blissful as Thou art,
Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss!
My mind knows nothing but Thy Lotus Feet.
The King of Death scowls at me terribly;
Tell me, Mother, what shall I say to him? . . .
He sang again:
560As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;
And faith is the root of all. . . .
He continued:
This world, O Mother, is Thy madhouse!
What can I say of all Thy virtues?
Setting aside Thine elephant, Thou roamest about on foot;
Putting off Thy gems and pearls, O Self-willed Mother,
Thou dost adorn Thy comely neck with a garland of human
heads.
Now Thou must rescue Ramprasad out of the forest of this
world.
Again he sang:
Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or
Prabhas,
So long as I can breathe my last with Kāli's name upon my
lips? . ..
And again:
Dwell, O mind, within yourself; Enter no other's home.
If you but seek there, you will find All you are searching for. . .
.
And then:
The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet. . . .
And then:
Cherish my precious Mother Syama
Tenderly within, O mind;
May you and I alone behold Her,
Letting no one else intrude. . . .
As the Master sang this last song he stood up. He was almost intoxicated with divine
love. Again and again he said to the devotees,
" Cherish my precious Mother Syama tenderly within."
Then he danced and sang:
Is Kāli, my Mother, really black?
The Naked One, of blackest hue,
Lights the Lotus of the Heart. . . .
The Master reeled as he sang. Niranjan came forward to hold him. The Master said to
him softly, "Don't touch me, you rascal!"
Seeing the Master dance, the devotees stood up. He caught hold of M.'s hand and said:
"Don't be foolish! Dance!"
561Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat, still charged with divine ecstasy. Coming down a little
to the normal state, he said: "Om! Om! Om!
Om! Om! Om Kāli!" Again he said, "Let me have a smoke." Many of the devotees stood
around. Mahimacharan was fanning him. The Master asked him to sit down and recite
from the scriptures. Mahimacharan recited from the Mahanirvana Tantra:
Om; I bow to Thee, the Everlasting Cause of the world;
I bow to Thee, Pure Consciousness, the Soul that sustains the whole universe.
I bow to Thee, who art One without duality, who dost bestow liberation;
I bow to Thee, Brahman, the all-pervading Attributeless Reality.
Thou alone art the Refuge, the only Object of adoration;
Thou art the only Cause of the universe, the Soul of everything that is;
Thou alone art the world's Creator, Thou its Preserver and Destroyer;
Thou art the immutable Supreme Lord, the Absolute; Thou art unchanging Consciousness.
Dread of the dreadful! Terror of the terrible!
Refuge of all beings! Purity of purifiers!
Thou alone dost rule over those in the high places,
Supreme over the supreme, the Protector of protectors.
Almighty Lord, who art made manifest as the Form of all, yet art Thyself unmanifest and
indestructible;
Thou who art imperceptible to the senses, yet art the very Truth;
Incomprehensible, imperishable, all-pervading, hidden, and without form;
O Lord! O Light of the Universe! Protect us from harm.
On that One alone we meditate; that One is the sole object of our worship;
To That alone, the non-dual Witness of the Universe, we bow.
In that One who alone exists and who is our sole eternal Support, we seek, refuge,
The self-dependent Lord, the Vessel of Safety in the ocean of existence.
Sri Ramakrishna listened to the hymn with folded hands. After it was sung he saluted
Brahman; the devotees did likewise.
Adhar arrived from Calcutta and bowed down before the Master.
MASTER (to M.): "We have had such joy today! How much joy Hari's name creates! Is it
not so?"
M: "Yes, sir."
Mahimacharan was a student of philosophy. That day he too had chanted the name of
Hari and danced during the kirtan. This made the Master very happy.
It was about dusk. Many of the devotees took their leave. A lamp was lighted in Sri
Ramakrishna's room and incense was burnt.
After some time the moon came out, flooding the sky with its light.
562Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his couch. He was in a spiritual mood, absorbed in
contemplation of the Divine Mother. Now and then he chanted Her hallowed name. Adhar
was sitting on the floor. M. and Niranjan, too, were there. Sri Ramakrishna began to talk
to Adhar.
MASTER: "What! You have come just now! We have had so much kirtan and dancing.
Shyamdas began the kirtan. He is Ram's music teacher. But I didn't enjoy his singing
very much; I didn't feel like dancing. Later I heard about his character. I was told that
he had as many mistresses as there are hairs on a man's head.
"Didn't you get the job?"
Adhar held the post of deputy magistrate, a government post that carried with it great
prestige. He earned three hundred rupees a month. He had applied for the office of vice-
chairman of the Calcutta Municipality. The salary attached to this office was one
thousand rupees. In order to secure it, Adhar had interviewed many influential people in
Calcutta.
MASTER (to M. and Niranjan): "Hazra said to me, 'Please pray to the Divine Mother for
Adhar, that he may secure the job.' Adhar made the same request to me. I said to the
Mother: 'O Mother, Adhar has been visiting You. May he get the job if it pleases You.' But
at the same time I said to Her: 'How small-minded he is! He is praying to You for things
like that and not for Knowledge and Devotion.'
(To Adhar) "Why did you dance attendance on all those small-minded people? You have
seen so much; you have heard so much!
After reading the entire Ramayana, to ask whose wife Sita is!' "
ADHAR: "A man cannot but do these things if he wants to lead a householder's life. You
haven't forbidden us to, have you?"
Advice to Adhar about renunciation
MASTER: "Nivritti alone is good, and not pravritti. Once, when I was in a God-intoxicated
state, I was asked to go to the manager of the Kāli temple to sign the receipt for my
salary. They all do it here. But I said to the manager: 'I cannot do that. I am not asking
for any salary. You may give it to someone else if you want.' I am the servant of God
alone. Whom else shall I serve? Mallick noticed the late hours of my meals and arranged
for a cook. He gave me one rupee for a month's expenses. That embarrassed me. I had
to run to him whenever he sent for me. It would have been quite a different thing if I
had gone to him of my own accord.
"In leading the worldly life one has to humour mean-minded people and do many such
things. After the attainment of my exalted state, I noticed how things were around me
and said to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother! Please change the direction of my mind right
now, so that I may not have to flatter rich people.'
563(To Adhar) "Be satisfied with the job you have. People hanker after a post paying fifty or
a hundred rupees, and you are earning three hundred rupees! You are a deputy
magistrate. I saw a deputy magistrate at Kamarpukur. His name was Ishwar Ghosha! He
had a turban on his head. Men's very bones trembled before him. I remember having
seen him during my boyhood. Is a deputy magistrate a person to be trifled with?
"Serve him whom you are already serving. The mind becomes soiled by serving but one
master. And to serve five masters!
"Once a woman became attached to a Mussalman and invited him to her room. But he
was a righteous person; he said to her that he wanted to use the toilet and must go
home to get his water-jar for water. The woman offered him her own, but he said: 'No,
that will not do. I shall use the jar to which I have already exposed myself. I cannot
expose myself before a new one.' With these words he went away. That brought the
woman to her senses. She understood that a new water-jar, in her case, signified a
paramour."
Narendra was in straitened circumstances on account of his father's unexpected death.
He had been seeking a job to maintain his mother, brothers, and sisters. He had served
a few days as headmaster of the Vidyasagar School at Bowbazar.
ADHAR: "May I ask if Narendra would accept a job?"
MASTER: "Yes, he would. He has his mother, brothers, and sisters to support."
ADHAR: "Well, Narendra can support his family with fifty or with a hundred rupees. Will
he try for a hundred?"
MASTER: "Worldly people think highly of their wealth. They feel that there is nothing like
it. Sambhu said, 'It is my desire to leave all my property at the Lotus Feet of God.' But
does God care for money? He wants from His devotees knowledge, devotion,
discrimination, and renunciation.
"After the theft of the jewelry from the temple of Radhakanta, Mathur Babu said: 'O God,
You could not protect Your own jewelry! What a shame!' Once he wanted to give me an
estate and consulted Hriday about it. I overheard the whole thing from the Kāli temple
and said to him: 'Please don't harbour any such thought. It will injure me greatly.' "
ADHAR: "I can tell you truthfully, sir, that not more than six or seven persons like you
have been born since the creation of the world."
MASTER: "How so? There certainly are people who have given up everything for God. As
soon as a man gives up his wealth, people come to know about him. But it is also true
that there are others unknown to people. Are there not such holy men in upper India?"
ADHAR: "I know of at least one such person in Calcutta. He is Devendranath Tagore."
564MASTER: "What did you say? Who has enjoyed the world as much as he? Once I visited
him at his house with Mathur Babu. I saw that he had many young children. The family
physician was there writing out prescriptions.
If, after having eight children, a man doesn't think of God, then who will? If, after,
enjoying so much wealth, Devendranath hadn't thought of God, then people would have
cried shame upon him."
NIRANJAN: "But he paid off all his father's debts."
MASTER: "Keep quiet! Don't torment me any more. Do you call anyone a man who
doesn't payoff his father's debts if he is able to?
But I admit that Devendranath is infinitely greater than other worldly men, who are sunk
in their worldliness. They can learn much from him.
Signs of a real devotee
There is an ocean of difference between a real all-renouncing devotee of God and a
householder devotee. A real sannyāsi, a real devotee who has renounced the world, is
like a bee. The bee will not light on anything but a flower. It will not drink anything but
honey.
But a devotee leading the worldly life is like a fly. The fly sits on a festering sore as well
as on a sweetmeat. One moment he enjoys a spiritual mood, and the next moment he is
beside himself with the pleasure of 'woman and gold'.
"A devotee who has really and truly renounced all for God is like the chatak bird. It will
drink only the rain-water that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It will rather
die of thirst than touch any other water, though all around there may lie seven oceans
and rivers full to the brim with water. An all-renouncing devotee will not touch 'woman
and gold'. He will not keep 'woman and gold' near him lest he should feel attached."
ADHAR: "But Chaitanya, too, enjoyed the world."
MASTER (amazed): "What? What did he enjoy in the world?"
ADHAR: "Scholarship! Honour!"
MASTER: "It was honour in the sight of others, but nothing to him. Whether you―a
deputy magistrate―or this youngster Niranjan honours me, it is all the same to me. And
I tell you this truthfully: the idea of controlling a wealthy man never enters my mind.
Surendra once said, rather condescendingly, that Rākhāl's father could sue me for letting
Rākhāl stay with me. When I heard this from Manomohan, I said: 'Who is this Surendra?
How does he dare make a remark like that? He keeps a carpet and pillow here and gives
me some money. Is that his excuse for daring to make such an impudent remark?' "
ADHAR: "I understand that he gives ten rupees a month. Isn't that so?"
565MASTER: "That covers two months expenses. The devotees stay here and he gives the
money for their service. It is he who earns the merit. What is that to me? Is it for my
personal gain that I love Narendra, Rākhāl, and the others?"
M: "Your love for them is like a mother's for her children."
Master's genuine love for his disciples
MASTER: "But even behind the mother's love lies her hope that the children will support
her later on. But I love these youngsters because I see in them Narayana Himself. These
are not mere words.
God takes charge of His devotees
(To Adhar) "Listen. There is no scarcity of moths when the lamp is lighted. When God is
realized, He Himself provides everything for His devotees. He sees that they do not lack
anything. When God is enshrined in the heart, many people come forward to offer their
services.
"Once a young sannyasi went to a householder to beg his food. He had lived as a monk
from his very birth; he knew nothing of worldly matters. A young daughter of the
householder came out to give him alms; He turned to her mother and said, 'Mother, has
this girl abscesses on her chest?' The mother said: 'No, my child. God has given her
breasts to nurse her child when she becomes a mother.' Thereupon the sannyasi said:
'Then why should I worry about myself? Why should I beg my food? He who has created
me will certainly feed me.'
"Listen. If a woman renounces everything for her paramour, she can say to him, if need
be, 'You wretch! I shall sit on your chest and devour you.'
"Nangta told me of a certain king who gave a feast to the sādhus, using plates and
tumblers of gold. I noticed in the monasteries at Benares with what great respect the
abbots were treated. Many wealthy up-country people stood before them with folded
hands, ready to obey their commands. But a true sādhu, a man who has really
renounced everything, seeks neither a gold plate nor honour.
God sees that he lacks nothing. God gives the devotee everything that is needed for
realizing Him.
(To Adhar) "You are an executive officer. What shall I say to you? Do whatever you think
best. I am an illiterate person."
ADHAR (smiling, to the devotees): "Now he is examining me."
MASTER (smiling) : "Dispassion alone is good. Don't you see, I didn't sign the receipt for
my salary? God alone is real and all else is illusory."
Hazra entered the room and sat with the devotees on the floor. Hazra repeated now and
then, "Soham! Soham!" "I am He! I am He!"
566To Lātu and other devotees he often said: "What does one gain by worshipping God with
offerings? That is merely giving Him things that are His already." He had said this once
to Narendra.
The Master spoke to him.
MASTER: "I explained to Lātu who the object of the devotee's worship is."
HAZRA: "The devotee really prays to his own Self."
MASTER: "What you say is a very lofty thought. The aim of spiritual discipline, of
chanting God's name and glories, is to realize just that. A man attains everything when
he discovers his true Self in himself. The object of sādhanā is to realize that. That also is
the purpose of assuming a human body. One needs the clay mould as long as the gold
image has not been cast; but when the image is made, the mould is thrown away. The
body may be given up after the realization of God.
"God is not only inside us; He is both inside and outside. The Divine Mother showed me
in the Kāli temple that everything is Chinmaya, the Embodiment of Spirit; that it is She
who has become all this―the image, myself, the utensils of worship, the door-sill, the
marble floor. Everything is indeed Chinmaya.
"The aim of prayer, of spiritual discipline, of chanting the name and glories of God, is to
realize just that. For that alone a devotee loves God. These youngsters are on a lower
level; they haven't yet reached a high spiritual state. They are following the path of
bhakti. Please don't tell them such things as 'I am He'."
Like the mother bird brooding over her chicks, Sri Ramakrishna was alert to protect his
devotees.
Adhar and Niranjan went out on the porch to take refreshments. Presently they returned
to the room.
ADHAR (smiling): "We talked about so many things. (Pointing to M.) But he didn't utter a
word."
MASTER: "In Keshab's organization there was a young man with four university degrees.
He laughed when he saw people arguing with me. He said: 'To argue with him! How
silly!' I saw him again, later on, at one of Keshab's meetings. But then he did not have
the same bright complexion."
Sri Ramakrishna sat on the floor for his supper. It was a light meal of a little farina
pudding and one or two luchis that had been offered in the Kāli temple. M. and Lātu
were in the room. The devotees had brought various sweets for the Master. He touched
a sandesh and asked Lātu, "Who is the rascal that brought this?" He took it out of the
cup and left it on the ground. He said to Lātu and M.: "I know all about him. He is
immoral"
567LĀTU: "Shall I give you this sweet?"
MASTER: "Kishori brought it."
LĀTU: "Will it suit you?"
MASTER (smiling): "Yes."
M. had received an English education. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "It is not possible for
me to eat things offered by anyone and everyone. Do you believe this?"
M: "Gradually I shall have to believe all these things."
MASTER: "Yes, that is so."
After finishing the meal Sri Ramakrishna washed his mouth. He said to M., "Then will you
give the rupee to Naran?" "Yes," said M., "certainly I will."
The moon rose in the clear autumn sky and was reflected in the river. It was ebb-tide in
the Ganges and the river flowed south toward the sea.
Sunday, September 14, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Narendra, Bhavanath, the Mukherji
brothers, and other devotees. Rākhāl was staying with Balarām at Vrindāvan and was
laid up with an attack of fever. Narendra was preparing himself for his coming law
examination.
About eleven o'clock Jnan Babu arrived. He was a government official and had received
four university degrees.
MASTER (at the sight of Jnan Babu): "Well! Well! This sudden awakening of
'knowledge'!"
JNAN (smiling): "You must admit, sir, that one sees the awakening of knowledge as a
result of very good fortune."
MASTER (smiling): "You are Jnan. Then why should you have ajnan, ignorance? Oh, I
understand. Where there is knowledge there is also ignorance. The sage Vasishtha was
endowed with great knowledge and still he wept at the death of his sons. Therefore I ask
you to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance. The thorn of ignorance has pierced the
sole of a man's foot. He needs the thorn of knowledge to take it out. Afterwards he
throws away both thorns. The Jnāni says, 'This world is a "framework of illusion".' But he
who is beyond both knowledge and ignorance describes it as a 'mansion of mirth'. He
sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe, all living beings, and the
twenty-four cosmic principles.
568Living in the world after realization of God
"A man can live in the world after attaining God. Then he can lead the life of
detachment. In the country I have seen the women of the carpenter families making
flattened rice with a husking-machine. With one hand one of them turns the paddy in the
hole and with the other she holds a nursing child. At the same time she talks with the
buyer. She says to him: 'You owe me two ānnās . Pay it before you go.' But seventy-five
per cent of the woman's mind is on her hand lest it should be crushed by the pestle of
the husking machine.
"A man should do his worldly duties with only twenty-five percent of his mind, devoting
the rest to God."
Referring to Pundit Shashadhar, the Master said to the devotees, "I found him
monotonous―engaged in the dry discussion of philosophy.
"He alone who, after reaching the Nitya, the Absolute, can dwell in the Lila, the Relative,
and again climb from the Lila to the Nitya, has ripe knowledge and devotion. Sages like
Nārada cherished love of God after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman. This is called
vijnāna.
"Mere dry knowledge is like an ordinary rocket: it bursts into a few sparks and then dies
out. But the Knowledge of sages like Nārada and Sukadeva is like a good rocket: for a
while it showers balls of different colours, and then it stops; again it throws out new
balls, and again it stops; and thus it goes on. Those sages had prema for God. Prema is
the rope by which one can reach Satchidananda."
The Master finished his midday meal and rested a few minutes. Bhavanath, M., the
Mukherji brothers, Hazra, and several other devotees sat down under the bakul-tree and
began to converse. The Master stopped there awhile on his way to the pine-grove.
HAZRA (to the younger Gopal): "Please prepare a smoke for him [meaning the Master]."
MASTER (smiling): "Why don't you admit that you want it?" (All laugh.)
MUKHERJI (to Hazra): "You must have learnt much wisdom from him [meaning the
Master]."
MASTER (smiling): "No, he has been wise like this from his boyhood." (All laugh.)
Presently Sri Ramakrishna returned from the pine-grove. The devotees noticed that he
was in an ecstatic mood and was reeling like a drunkard. After reaching his room he
regained the normal state.
Many devotees gathered in the room. Among them was a new-comer, a sadhaka from
Konnagar, who looked over fifty years of age and seemed to have great vanity of
scholarship.
569The Master stood in the middle of the room and suddenly said to M., "He came
here―Naran."
Narendra was engaged in a discussion with Hazra and a few others on the verandah.
They could be heard from the room.
MASTER (referring to Narendra): "The chatterbox! But he is now much worried about his
family."
M.: "Yes, sir, it is true."
MASTER: "Once he said that he would look upon adversity as his good fortune. Isn't that
so?"
M: "He has great strength of mind."
A DEVOTEE: "Does he lack strength in anything?"
Pointing to the sadhaka from Konnagar, a devotee said to the Master: "Sir, he has come
to visit you. He has some questions to ask."
The sadhaka was seated erect, his chin up.
SADHAKA: "Sir, what is the way?"
MASTER: "Faith in the guru's words. One attains God by following the guru's instructions
step by step. It is like reaching an object by following the trail of a thread."
SADHAKA: "Is it possible to see God?"
MASTER: "He is unknowable by the mind engrossed in worldliness. One cannot attain
God if one has even a trace of attachment to 'woman and gold'. But He is knowable by
the pure mind and the pure intelligence―the mind and intelligence that have not the
slightest trace of attachment. Pure Mind, Pure Intelligence, Pure Ātman are one and the
same thing."
SADHAKA: "But the scriptures say, 'From Him words and mind return baffled.' He is
unknowable by mind and words."
MASTER: "Oh, stop! One cannot understand the meaning of the scriptures without
practising spiritual discipline. What will you gain by merely uttering the word 'siddhi'?
The pundits glibly quote the scriptures; but what will that accomplish? A man does not
become intoxicated even by rubbing siddhi on his body; he must swallow it. What is the
use of merely repeating, 'There is butter in the milk'?
Turn the milk into curd and churn it. Only then will you get butter."
570SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. But you too are quoting the scriptures."
MASTER: "What will one gain by merely quoting or hearing the scriptures? One must
assimilate them. The almanac makes a forecast of the rainfall for the year, but you won't
get a drop by squeezing its pages."
SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. Have you done it yourself?"
MASTER: "You don't have to bother about what I have or haven't done. Besides, it is
very difficult to explain these things to others.
Suppose someone asks you, 'What does ghee taste like?' Your answer will be, 'Ghee
tastes like ghee.'
"To understand these things one needs to live with holy men, just as to understand the
pulse of bile, of phlegm, and so on, one needs to live with a physician."
SADHAKA: "There are some people who are irritated by others' company."
MASTER: "That happens only after the attainment of Knowledge, after the realization of
God. Shouldn't a beginner live in the company of holy men?"
The sadhaka sat in silence a few moments. Then he said with some irritation: "Please tell
me whether you have realized God either directly or intuitively. You may answer me if
you are able, or you may keep silent if you wish." The Master said with a smile: "What
shall I say? One can only give a hint."
SADHAKA: "Then tell us that much."
Narendra was going to sing. He said, "No one has brought a pakhoaj."
THE YOUNGER GOPAL: "Mahimacharan has one."
MASTER (interrupting): "No, we don't want anything of his here."
A devotee from Konnagar sang a song. Every now and then Sri Ramakrishna glanced at
the sadhaka. The singer and Narendra became engaged in a furious discussion about
musical technique. The sadhaka said to the singer, "What is the use of such
discussions?" Referring to another man who had joined in the discussion, Sri
Ramakrishna said to the sadhaka, "Why didn't you scold him, too?" It could be seen that
the sadhaka was not on friendly terms with his companions from Konnagar.
Narendra sang:
O Lord, must all my days pass by so utterly in vain?
Down the path of hope I gaze with longing, day and night. . . .
571The sadhaka closed his eyes in meditation as he listened to the song. It was four o'clock
in the afternoon. The rays of the setting sun fell on his body. Sri Ramakrishna quickly
opened an umbrella and placed it near the door so that the sun might not disturb the
sadhaka.
Narendra sang again:
How shall I call on Thee, O Lord, with such a stained and
worldly mind?
Can a straw remain unharmed, cast in a pit of Raming coals?
Thou, all goodness, art the fire, and I, all sin, am but a straw:
How shall I ever worship Thee?
The glory of Thy name, they say, redeems those even past
redeeming;
Yet, when I chant Thy sacred name, alas! my poor heart quakes
with fright.
I spend my life a slave to sin; how can I find a refuge, then,
O Lord, within Thy holy way?
In Thine abounding kindliness, rescue Thou this sinful wretch;
Drag me off by the hair of my head and give me shelter at Thy
feet.
Again he sang:
Sweet is Thy name, O Refuge of the humble!
It falls like sweetest nectar on our ears
And comforts us, Beloved of our souls!
The priceless treasure of Thy name alone
Is the abode of Immortality,
And he who chants Thy name becomes immortal.
Falling upon our ears, Thy holy name
Instantly slays the anguish of our hearts,
Thou Soul of our souls, and fills our hearts with bliss!
As Narendra sang the line, "And he who chants Thy name becomes immortal", the
Master went into samādhi. At first his fingers, especially the thumbs, began to tremble.
The devotees from Kannagar had never seen the Master in samādhi. Seeing him silent,
they were about to leave the room. Bhavanath said to them: "Why are you going away?
This is his samādhi." The devotees resumed their places.
Narendra sang:
I have laboured day and night
To make Thy seat within my heart;
Wilt Thou not be kind to me,
O Lord of the World, and enter there?
Sri Ramakrishna, still in the ecstatic mood, came dawn from his couch to the floor and
sat by Narendra. The beloved disciple sang again:
572In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full,
And Love's flood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.
O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . .
As Narendra sang the last line, Sri Ramakrishna stood up, still absorbed in samādhi.
Futility of mere study of scriptures
After a long time the Master regained partial consciousness of the world and sat down on
the mat. Narendra finished his singing, and the Tānpura was put back in its place. The
Master was still in a spiritual mood and said: "Mother, tell me what this is. They want
someone to extract the butter for them and hold it to their mouths. They won't throw the
spiced bait into the lake. They won't even hold the fishing-rod. Someone must catch the
fish and put it into their hands! How troublesome! Mother, I won't listen to any more
argument.
The rogues force it on me. What a bother! I shall shake it off. God is beyond the Vedas
and their injunctions. Can one realize Him by studying the scriptures, the Vedas, and the
Vedānta? (To Narendra) Do you understand this? The Vedas give only a hint"
Narendra wanted the Tānpura again. The Master said, "I want to sing." He was still in an
ecstatic mood and sang:
Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart,
That even with Thee for Mother, and though I am wide awake,
There should be robbery in my house. . .
The Master said, "Mother, why do You make me argue?" He sang again:
Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood;
From One who knows it well, I have learnt the secret of
bhava…
The Master said, "I am quite conscious." But he was still groggy with divine fervour. He
sang once more:
I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,
As I repeat my Mother Kāli's name;
It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk!...
Futility of reasoning
Sri Ramakrishna had said, "Mother, I won't listen to any more argument."
Narendra sang:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .
573Sri Ramakrishna said with a smile: "O Mother, make me mad! God cannot be realized
through knowledge and reasoning, through the arguments in the scriptures." He had
been pleased with the singing of the musician from Konnagar and said to him humbly:
"Please sing about the Divine Mother. Please - one song."
MUSICIAN: "You must excuse me, sir."
MASTER (bowing with folded hands): "No, sir. I can enforce this demand."
Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna sang a few lines from a kirtan, assuming the attitude of a
gopi:
Radha has every right to say it;
She has kept awake for Krishna.
She has stayed awake all night,
And she has every right to be piqued.
Then he said to the musician: "My dear sir, you are a child of the Divine Mother. She
dwells in all beings. Therefore I have every right to enforce my demand. A farmer said to
his guru, 'I shall get my mantra from you by beating you, if I have to.' "
MUSICIAN (smiling): "By a shoe-beating?"
MASTER (smiling): "No! I won't go that far."
Again in an abstracted mood Sri Ramakrishna said: "The beginner, the struggling, the
perfect, and the supremely perfect. Which are you―perfect or supremely perfect? Come
along! Sing for us."
The musician complied. He sang just a melody.
MASTER: "My dear sir, that too makes me happy."
The musician then sang a song. When the music was over, the devotees from Konnagar
saluted the Master and took their leave.
The sadhaka bowed before him with folded hands and said, "Holy man, let me say good-
bye."
Sri Ramakrishna, still in an ecstatic mood, was talking to the Divine Mother.
MASTER: "Mother, is it You or I? Do I do anything? No. no! It is You.
Was it You who heard the arguments all this time, or was it I? No, not I. It was You.".
Sri Ramakrishna became conscious of the outer world and began to converse with
Narendra, Bhavanath, and the other devotees.
574They were talking about the sadhaka.
BHAVANATH (smiling): "What kind of man is he?"
MASTER: "He is a tamasic devotee."
BHAVANATH: "He can certainly recite Sanskrit verses."
MASTER: "Once I said to a man about a sādhu: 'He is a rajasic sādhu. Why should one
give him food and other presents?' At this another sādhu taught me a lesson by saying
to me: 'Don't say that. There are three classes of holy men: sattvic, rajasic, and
tamasic.' Since that day I have respected holy men of all classes."
NARENDRA (smiling): "What? Is it like the 'elephant God'? All, indeed, are God."
MASTER (smiling): "It is God Himself who sports in the world as both vidyā and avidyā.
Therefore I salute both. It is written in the Chandi: 'The Divine Mother is the good
fortune of the blessed and the ill fortune of the unlucky.' (To Bhavanath) Is that
mentioned in the Vishnu Purana?"
BHAVANATH (smiling): "I don't know, sir. The devotees from Konnagar did not
understand your samādhi and were about to leave the room."
MASTER: "Who was it that asked them to remain?"
BHAVANATH (smiling): "It was I."
MASTER: "My child, you are equally good in bringing people here and in driving them
away."
The conversation turned to the argument that Narendra had had with the musician from
Konnagar.
MUKHERJI: "Narendra didn't spare him."
MASTER: "That's right. One needs such grit. This is called the influence of tamas on
sattva. Must a man listen to everything another man says? Should one say to a
prostitute, 'All right, you may do whatever you like'? Must one listen to her? At one time
Radha was piqued. A friend said, 'Her ego has been roused.' Brinde, another friend, said:
'Whose is this' ego? Her ego belongs to Krishna alone. She is proud in the pride of
Krishna.' "
Glory of God's name
The conversation turned to the glory of God's name.
BHAVANATH: "I feel such relief while chanting the name of Hari."
575MASTER: "He who relieves us of sin is Hari. He relieves us of our three afflictions in the
world. Chaitanya preached the glory of Hari's name; so it must be good. You see, he was
such a great scholar, and an Incarnation too. Since he preached that name, it must be
good. (Smiling) Once some peasants were invited to a feast. They were asked if they
would eat a preparation of hog plum. They answered: 'You may give it to us if the
gentlemen have eaten it. If they enjoyed it, then it must be good.' (All laugh.)
(To the Mukherji brothers) "I should like to visit Shivanath; I won't have to hire a
carriage if you take me in yours."
MUKHERJI: "All right, sir, we shall set a day."
MASTER (to the devotees): "Do you think the Brahmos will like me? They criticize those
who believe in God with form."
Mahendra Mukherji wanted to go on a pilgrimage. He told Sri Ramakrishna so.
MASTER (smiling): "How is that? Do you want to go when the sprout of divine love has
hardly corne up? First comes the sprout, then the tree, then the fruit. We are so happy
to have you here to talk to."
MAHENDRA: "I feel like visiting the holy places a little. I shall return soon."
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna left his room. The devotees
were walking in the garden. Many of them were about to leave.
The Master was conversing with Hazra on the north verandah. They were talking of
Narendra's frequent visits to Annada, the eldest son of the Guhas.
HAZRA: "I hear that Annada is now practising austerity. He lives on very little food and
eats rice once every four days."
MASTER: "Is that so? 'Who knows? One may realize God even by means of a religious
garb.'"
HAZRA: "Narendra sang the Āgamani ."
MASTER (eagerly): "How did he sing it?"
Kishori stood close by. The Master said to him, "Are you well?"
A little later the Master was standing on the west porch. Since it was autumn, he had put
on a flannel shirt dyed with ochre. He asked Narendra, "Is it true that you sang the
Āgamani ?"
Accompanied by Narendra and M., Sri Ramakrishna walked to the embankment of the
Ganges.
576Narendra sang the Āgamani :
Tell me, my Uma, how have you fared, alone in the Stranger's
house?
People speak so much ill of us! Alas, I die of shame!
My Son-in-law smears His body with ashes from the funeral
pyre
And roams about in great delight;
You too, along with Him, cover with ash your golden skin.
He begs the food that He eats! How can I bear it, being your
mother?
This time, when He returns to claim you, I shall say to Him,
"My daughter Umā is not at home."
Sri Ramakrishna stood listening to the song and went into samādhi. The sun was still
above the horizon as the Master stood on the embankment in the ecstatic mood. On one
side of him was the Ganges, flowing north with the flood-tide. Behind him was the flower
garden. To his right one could see the nahabat and the Panchavati. Narendra stood by
his side and sang. Gradually the darkness of evening fell upon the earth.
After Narendra and several other devotees had saluted the Master and left for Calcutta,
Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room. He was absorbed in meditation on the Divine
Mother and was chanting Her holy name.
Master at Jadu's garden
Jadu Mallick had arrived at his garden house next to the Kāli temple. He sent for the
Master. Adhar, too, had arrived from Calcutta, and he saluted Sri Ramakrishna. The
Master asked Lātu to light the lantern and accompany him to Jadu's garden.
MASTER (to M.): "Why didn't you bring Naran with you?"
M: "Shall I come with you?"
MASTER: "Do you want to come? Adhar and the others are here. All right, you may
come. Will the Mukherjis also come with us? (To the Mukherjis) Come along. Then we
can leave Jadu-Mallick quickly."
The Master went to Jadu's drawing-room. It was a well furnished room, with everything
spick and span. The lamps were lighted. Jadu was sitting with his friends and was
playing with the children. Servants were in attendance. Smiling, Jadu welcomed Sri
Ramakrishna, but he did not get up. He treated the Master as a friend of long
acquaintance.
Jadu was a devotee of Gaurānga. He had just seen a performance of Gaurānga's life at
the Star Theatre and told the Master about it. The Master listened to his account joyfully
and played with the children. M. and the Mukherji brothers sat near him. In the course of
the conversation Sri Ramakrishna told Jadu that Adhar had not been able to secure the
577post of vice-chairman of the Calcutta Municipality. Jadu said that Adhar was still young
and could try for it again. At his request the Master sang a few songs about Gaurānga.
After the music was over, the Mukherjis were about to take their leave. The Master, too,
was ready to go, but he was in an ecstatic mood. On coming to the porch he went into
samādhi. The gate-keeper of the garden house was a pious man. Now and then he
invited the Master to his house and fed him. Sri Ramakrishna stood there in samādhi and
the gate-keeper fanned him with a large fan. Ratan, the manager of the garden house,
saluted the Master, and Sri Ramakrishna, returning to the consciousness of the relative
world, greeted the manager and the gate-keeper, saying, "Narayana". Then,
accompanied by the devotees, he went back to the temple- garden through the main
gate.
MASTER (to the Mukherjis, pointing to M.): "Please visit him often."
MUKHERJI (smiling): "Yes, henceforth he will be our teacher."
MASTER: "It is the nature of the hemp-smoker to make merry in the company of another
hemp-smoker. He will not talk even to an amir, but he will embrace a wretched hemp-
smoker if he happens to meet one." (All laugh.)
It was about nine o'clock. The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master and went away.
Adhar and M. sat on the floor in the Master's room while he talked to Adhar about Rākhāl
.
His worry over Rākhāl 's illness
Rākhāl was staying in Vrindāvan with Balarām. The Master had learnt from a letter
about Rākhāl 's illness. He was so worried about him that two or three days earlier he
had wept before Hazra like a child. Adhar had sent a registered letter to Rākhāl but had
received no reply.
MASTER (to Adhar): "Naran has received a letter from Vrindāvan. Why haven't you
received a reply to yours?"
ADHAR: "I haven't yet heard from Vrindāvan."
MASTER: "M. has also received a letter from Vrindāvan."
They began to talk of Sri Ramakrishna's seeing a play, at the Star Theatre, about the life
of Cauranga.
MASTER (smiling): "Jadu told me that one could see the play very well from a one-rupee
seat. Very cheap! Once we were talking about going to Panihati. Jadu wanted me to go
in a country boat with a whole crowd of passengers. (All laugh.)
"Formerly he liked to hear a little about God. But I don't see Jadu much nowadays. He is
always surrounded by flatterers. They have spoiled him. He is a man of a very
578calculating nature. I would no sooner set foot in his house than he would ask me,. 'How
much is the carriage hire?' I would say: 'You don't have to bother about it. You may give
two and a half rupees.' That would keep him quiet." (All laugh.)
It was late. Adhar was about to depart. The Master asked M. to bring Naran with him.

579Chapter 28
AT THE STAR THEATRE
Friday, September 19, 1884
IT WAS MAHALAYA, a sacred day of the Hindus, and the day of the new moon. At two
o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Mahendra Mukherji,
Priya Mukherji, M., Baburam, Harish, Kishori, and Lātu. Some were sitting on the floor,
some standing, and others moving about. Hazra was sitting on the porch. Rākhāl was
still at Vrindāvan with Balarām.
Master praises Captain's devotion
MASTER (to the devotees): "I was at Captain's house in Calcutta. It was very late when I
returned. What a sweet nature Captain has! What devotion! He performs the Ārati
before the image. First he waves a lamp with three lights, then a lamp with one light,
and last of all he waves burning camphor. When performing the worship he does not
speak. Once he motioned to me to take my seat. During the worship his eyes become
swollen from spiritual emotion. They look as if they have been stung by wasps. He
cannot sing, but he chants hymns beautifully. In his mother's presence he sits on a lower
level; she sits on a high stool.
"His father was a havildar in the English army. He would hold a gun with one hand and
with the other worship Śiva. His servant made a clay image of Śiva for him. He wouldn't
even touch water before performing the worship. He earned six thousand rupees a
year.
"Captain sends his mother to Benares now and then. Twelve or thirteen servants attend
her there; it is very expensive. Captain knows the Vedānta, the Gitā, and the Bhagavata
by heart. He says that the educated gentlemen of Calcutta follow the ways of the
mlechchhas.
"In his earlier years he practised hathayoga. That is why he strokes my head gently
when I am in samādhi. His wife worships the Deity in another form-that of Gopala. This
time I didn't find her so miserly. She too knows the Gitā and other scriptures. What
devotion they have!
"They cooked a goat curry. Captain said they could eat it for fifteen days, but she said,
'No, no! Only seven days.' But I liked the taste of it. They serve a very small quantity of
each dish, but nowadays they give me good portions since I eat more than they do. After
the meal either Captain or his wife fans me.
"They are very pious souls and show great respect to holy men. The people of upper
India are greatly devoted to sādhus. The sons and nephews of the Jung Bahadur of
Nepal once visited the temple garden; before me they showed great respect and
humility. Once a young girl of Nepal came to see me with Captain. She was a great
580devotee, and unmarried; she knew the whole of the Gitagovinda by heart. Dwarika Babu
and the others wanted to hear her music. When she sang the Gitagovinda, Dwarika Babu
was profoundly moved and wiped the tears from his eyes with his handkerchief. She was
asked why she was not married. She said: 'I am the handmaid of God. Whom else shall I
serve?' Her people respect her as a goddess, as the scriptures enjoin.
(To Mahendra Mukherji and the others) "I shall feel very happy to know that you are
being benefited by your visits here. (To M.) Why do people come here? I don't know
much of reading and writing."
M.: "God's power is in you. That is why there is such power of attraction. It is the Divine
Spirit that attracts."
MASTER: "Yes, this is the attraction of Yogamaya, the Divine Śakti. She casts the spell.
God performs all His lila through the help of Yogamaya.
Nature of gopis' love for Krishna
"The love of the gopis was like the attachment of a woman to her paramour. They were
intoxicated with ecstatic love for Sri Krishna. A woman cherishing illicit love is not very
keen about her own husband. If she is told that her husband has come, she will say:
'What if he has? There is food in the kitchen. He can help himself.' But if she is told of
the arrival of a stranger-jovial, handsome, and witty-she will run to see him and peep at
him from behind a screen.
"You may raise an objection and say: 'We have not seen God. How can we feel attracted
to Him as the gopis felt attracted to Krishna?' But it is possible. 'I do not know Him. I
have only heard His name, and that has fixed my mind upon Him.' "
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the significance of Sri Krishna's stealing the gopis' clothes?"
MASTER: "There are eight fetters that bind a person to the world. The gopis were free
from all but one: shame. Therefore Krishna freed them from that one, too, by taking
away their clothes. On attaining God one gets rid of all fetters. (To Mahendra Mukherji
and the others) By no means all people feel attracted to God. There are special souls
who feel so. To love God one must be born with good tendencies. Otherwise, why should
you alone of all the people of Baghbazar come here? You can't expect anything good in a
dunghill. The touch of the Malaya breeze turns all trees into sandal-wood, no doubt. But
there are a few exceptions-the banyan, the cotton-tree, and the Aśwattha, for example.
(To the Mukherji brothers) "You are well off. If a man slips from the path of yoga, then
he is reborn in a prosperous family and starts again his spiritual practice for the
realization of God."
Unfulfilled desires make one deviate from yoga
MAHENDRA: "Why does one slip from the path of yoga?"
581MASTER: "While thinking of God the aspirant may feel a craving for material enjoyment.
It is this craving that makes him slip from the path. In his next life he will be born with
the spiritual tendencies that he failed to translate into action in his present life."
MAHENDRA: "Then what is the way?"
MASTER: "No salvation is possible for a man as long as he has desire, as long as he
hankers for worldly things. Therefore fulfil all your desires regarding food, clothes, and
sex. (Smiling) What do you say about the last one? Legitimate or illegitimate? (M. and
Mahendra laugh.)
"It is not good to cherish desires and hankerings. For that reason I used to fulfil
whatever desires came to my mind. Once I saw some coloured sweetmeats at
Burrabazar and wanted to eat them. They brought me the sweets and I ate a great
many. The result was that I fell ill.
"In my boyhood days, while bathing in the Ganges, I saw a boy with a gold ornament
around his waist. During my state of divine intoxication I felt a desire to have a similar
ornament myself. I was given one, but I couldn't keep it on very long. When I put it on,
I felt within my body the painful uprush of a current of air. It was because I had touched
gold to my skin. I wore the ornament a few moments and then had to put it aside.
Otherwise I should have had to tear it off.
"I once felt a desire to eat the famous sweetmeats of different cities. (All laugh.) I had a
desire to hear Sambhu's musical recital of the Chandi. After fulfilling that desire I wanted
to hear the same thing by Rajnarayan. That desire also was satisfied.
"At that time many holy men used to visit the temple garden. A desire arose in my mind
that there should be a separate store-room to supply them with their provisions. Mathur
Babu arranged for one. The sādhus were given food-stuffs, fuel, and the like from that
store-room.
"Once the idea came to me to put on a very expensive robe embroidered with gold and
to smoke a silver hubble-bubble. Mathur Babu sent me the new robe and the hubble-
bubble. I put on the robe. I also smoked the hubble-bubble in various fashions.
Sometimes I smoked it reclining this way, and sometimes that way, sometimes with
head up, and sometimes with head down. Then I said to myself, 'O mind, this is what
they call smoking a silver hubble-bubble.' Immediately I renounced it. I kept the robe on
my body a few minutes longer and then took it off. I began to trample it underfoot and
spit on it, saying: 'So this is an expensive robe! But it only increases man's rajas.'"
About Rākhāl
Rākhāl had been staying at Vrindāvan with Balarām. At first he had written excited
letters praising the holy place. He had written to M.: "It is the best of all places. Please
come here. The peacocks dance around, and one always hears and sees religious music
and dancing. There is an unending flow of divine bliss." But then Rākhāl had been laid up
582with an attack of fever. Sri Ramakrishna was very much worried about him and vowed to
worship the Divine Mother for his recovery. So he began to talk about Rākhāl.
MASTER: "Rākhāl had his first religious ecstasy while sitting here massaging my feet. A
Bhagavata scholar had been expounding the sacred book in the room. As Rākhāl listened
to his words, he shuddered every now and then. Then he became altogether still.
"His second ecstasy was at Balarām Bose's house. In that state he could not keep
himself sitting upright; he lay flat on the floor. Rākhāl belongs to the realm of the
Personal God. He leaves the place if one talks about the Impersonal.
"I have taken a vow to worship the Divine Mother when he recovers. You see, he has
renounced his home and relatives and completely surrendered himself to me. It was I
who sent him to his wife now and then. He still had a little desire for enjoyment.
(Pointing to M,) "Rākhāl has written him from Vrindāvan that it is a grand place-the
peacocks dance around. Now let the peacock's take care of him. He has really put me in
a fix.
Balarām's devotion
"Rākhāl has been staying with Balarām at Vrindāvan. Ah, what a nice nature Balarām
has! It is only for my sake that he doesn't go to Orissa, where his family owns an estate.
His brother stopped his monthly allowance and wrote to him: 'Come and stay with us
here. Why should you waste so much money in Calcutta?' But he didn't listen. He has
been living in Calcutta because he wants to see me.
What devotion to God! He is busy day and night with his worship. His gardener is always
making garlands of flowers for the Deity, He has decided to spend four months a year at
Vrindāvan to reduce his expenses. He gets a monthly allowance of two hundred rupees.
"Why am I so fond of the youngsters? They are still untouched by 'woman arid gold'. I
find that they belong to the class of the nityasiddhas, the everperfect."
Narendra's first visit
"When Narendra first came here he was dressed in dirty clothes; but his eyes and face
betokened some inner stuff. At that time he did not know many songs. He sang one or
two: 'Let us go back once more, O mind, to our own abode!' and 'O Lord, must all my
days pass by so utterly in vain?'
"Whenever he came here, I would talk only with him, though the room was filled with
people. He would say to me, 'Please talk to them', and then I would talk with the others.
"I became mad for the sight of him and wept for him in Jadu Mallick's garden house: 'I
wept here, too, holding Bholanath's hand.' Bholanath said, 'Sir, you shouldn't behave
that way for a mere kayastha boy.' One day the 'fat brahmin' said to me about
Narendra, with folded hands, 'Sir, he has very little education; why should you be so
restless for him?'
583"Bhavanath and Narendra are a pair. They are like man and woman. So I asked
Bhavanath to rent a house near Narendra's. Both of them belong to the realm of the
formless Reality.
Master warns the devotees about women
"I forbid the youngsters to spend a long time with women or visit them too frequently.
Haripada has fallen into the clutches of a woman of the Ghoshpara sect. She shows
maternal feeling for him; but Haripada is a child and doesn't understand its real
meaning. The women of that sect act that way when they see young boys. I understand
that Haripada lies on her lap and that she feeds him with her own hands. I shall tell him
that this is not good. This very maternal feeling leads to a downfall. The women of that
sect practise spiritual discipline in the company of men; they regard men as Krishna. A
teacher of that sect asks a woman devotee, 'Have you found your Krishna?' and she
says, 'Yes, I have found my Krishna.'
"The other day that woman came here. I watched the way she looked around and I
didn't approve of it. I said to her, 'You may treat Haripada any way you like, but don't
have any wrong feeling for him.'
"The youngsters are now in the stage of sadhana. They are aspirants. For them the only
thing now is renunciation. A sannyasi must not look even at the portrait of a woman. I
say to them: 'Don't sit beside a woman and talk to her, even if she is a devotee. You
may say a word or two to her, standing.' Even a perfect soul must follow this precept for
his own protection and also to set an example to others. When women, come to me, I
too say to them after a few minutes, 'Go and visit the temples.' If they don't get up, I
myself leave the room. Others will learn from my example.
Master's attraction for people
"Can you tell me why all these youngsters, and you people, too, visit me? There must be
something in me; or why should you all feel such a pull, such attraction?
His own reminiscences
"Once I visited Hriday's house at Sihore. From there I was taken to Syambazar. I had a
vision of Cauranga before I entered the village, and I realized that I should meet
Cauranga's devotees there. For seven days and nights I was surrounded by a huge
crowd of people. Such attraction! Nothing but kirtan and dancing day and night. People
stood in rows on the walls and even were in the trees.
"I stayed at Natavar Goswami's house. It was crowded day and night. In the morning I
would run away to the house of a weaver for a little rest. There too I found that people
would gather after a few minutes. They carried drums and cymbals with them, and the
drum constantly played:'Takuti! Takuti!' We would have our meal at three in the
afternoon.
"The rumour spread everywhere that a man had arrived who died seven times and came
back to life again. Hriday would drag me away from the crowd to a paddy-field for fear I
584might have an attack of heat apoplexy. The crowd would follow us there like a line of
ants. Again the cymbals and the never-ending Takuti! Takuti!' of the drums. Hriday
scolded them and said: 'Why do you bother us like this? Have we never heard kirtan?'
"The Vaishnava priests of the village came and almost started a quarrel. They thought I
would take their share of the fees from the devotees. But soon they discovered that I
didn't touch a piece of cloth or even a thread. Someone remarked that I was a
Brahmajnani. So the Vaishnava pundits wanted to test me. One said, 'Why hasn't he
beads, and a mark on his forehead?' Another of them replied, They have dropped from
him, as the dry branch from a coconut tree. It was there that I learnt this illustration of
the dry branch of a coconut tree. The upadhis, limitations, drop when one attains
Knowledge.
"People came thronging from distant villages. They even spent the night there. At
Syambazar I learnt the meaning of divine attraction. When God incarnates Himself on
earth He attracts people through the help of Yogamaya, His Divine Power. People
become spellbound."
It was about three o'clock in the afternoon. The Master had been conversing with the
Mukherji brothers and the other devotees, when Radhika Goswami, a Vaishnava scholar,
arrived and bowed before him. This was his first visit to the Master. Radhika Goswami
took a seat.
MASTER: "Are you a descendant of Advaita?"
GOSWAMI: "Yes, sir."
At this the Master saluted him with folded hands.
MASTER: "You are descended from Advaita Goswami. You must have inherited some of
his traits. A sweet-mango tree produces only sweet mangoes arid not sour ones. Of
course, it happens that some trees produce large mangoes and some small; that
depends on the soil. Isn't that true?"
GOSWAMI (humbly): "Sir, what do I know?"
MASTER: "Whatever you may say, others will not let you off so easily. Brahmans,
however imperfect they-may be, are worshipped by all on account of their having been
born in the lines of great sages. (To M.) Tell us the story of the samkhachila."
M. sat in silence.
MASTER: "If one of your ancestors was a great soul, he will certainly pull you up,
however unworthy you may be. When King Duryodhana and his brothers were taken
captive by the gandharvas, Yudhisthira released them in spite of the fact that King
Duryodhana was his enemy and had banished him to the forest.
585"Besides, one must show respect to the religious garb. Even the mere garb recalls to
mind the real object. Chaitanya once dressed an ass in a religious garb and then
prostrated himself before it.
"Why do people bow before a samkhachila? When Kamsa was about to kill the Divine
Mother, She Hew away taking the form of a samkhachila. So even now people salute the
bird.
"An Englishman arrived at the cantonment of Chanak. The sepoys saluted him. Koar
Singh explained to me: 'India is under the rule of the English. Therefore one should
salute an Englishman.
"The Saktas follow the Tantra, and the Vaishnavas the Purana. There is no harm for the
Vaishnavas in speaking publicly of their spiritual practices. But the Saktas maintain
secrecy about theirs. For this reason it is difficult to understand a Sakta.
(To Goswami) "You are all good people. How much japa you practise! How much you
chant the name of Hari!"
GOSWAMI (humbly): "Oh, no! We do very little. I am a great sinner."
MASTER (smiling): "You have humility. That is good. But there is also another way: 'I
chant the name of Hari. How can I be a sinner?' He who constantly repeats: 'I am a
sinner! I am a wretch!' verily becomes a sinner. What lack of faith! A man chants the
name of God so much, and still he talks of sin!"
Radhika Goswami listened to these words in amazement.
Master's following of different paths
MASTER: "At Vrindāvan I myself put on the garb of the Vaishnavas and wore it for
fifteen days. (To the devotees) I have practised the disciplines of all the paths, each for
a few days. Otherwise I should have found no peace of mind. (Smiling) I have practised
all the disciplines; I accept all paths. I respect the Saktas, the Vaishnavas, and also the
Vedantists. Therefore people of all sects come here. And everyone of them thinks that I
belong to his school. I also respect the modern Brahmajnanis.
"A man had a tub of dye. Such was its wonderful property that people could dye their
clothes any colour they wanted by merely dipping them in it. A clever man said to the
owner of the tub, 'Dye my cloth the colour of your dye-stuff.' (All laugh.)
"Why should I be one-sided? The idea that the people of a particular sect will not come
to me does not frighten me. I don't care a bit whether people come to me or not. The
thought of keeping anyone under my control never crosses my mind. Adhar Sen asked
me to ask the Divine Mother for a big position for him, but he didn't get it. If that makes
him think differently about me, what do I care?
586"Once at Keshab's house I found myself in a new mood. The Brahmos always speak of
the Impersonal; therefore I said to the Divine Mother in an ecstatic mood: 'Mother,
please don't come here. They don't believe in Your forms.'"
Radhika Goswami listened to these words of the Master against sectarianism and
remained silent.
Master's praise of Vijay Goswami
ASTER (smiling): "Vijay is in a wonderful state of mind nowadays. He falls to the ground
while chanting the name of Hari. He devotes himself to kirtan, meditation, and other
spiritual practices till four in the morning. He now puts on an ochre robe and prostrates
himself before the images of God. Once he accompanied me to Gadadhar's schoolhouse.
I pointed out the place where Gadadhar
used to meditate. At once Vijay prostrated himself there. Again he fell prostrate before
the picture of Chaitanyadeva."
GOSWAMI: "What about the image of Radha-Krishna?"
MASTER: "He prostrated himself there too. Vijay also follows all the conventions of
religious life."
GOSWAMI: "He can now be accepted in Vaishnava society."
MASTER: "People's opinions don't count for much with him."
GOSWAMI: "I don't mean that. By accepting him Vaishnava society will honour itself."
MASTER: "He respects me very much. But it is difficult to reach him. One day he is called
to Dāccā, the next day to some other place. He is always busy. His presence has created
great trouble in the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj."
GOSWAMI: "Why so, sir?"
MASTER: The Brahmos tell him: 'You mix with people who worship God with form. You
are an idolater.' Vijay is liberal and straightforward. Unless a man is guileless, he
doesn't receive the grace of God. Sri Ramakrishna talked to the Mukherji brothers.
Mahendra, the elder, had his own business. Priyanath, the younger, had been an
engineer. After making some provision for himself, he had given up his job. Mahendra
was thirty-five or thirty-six years old. The brothers had homes both in the country and in
Calcutta.
MASTER (smiling): "Don't sit idle simply because your spiritual consciousness has been
awakened a little. Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandalwood there are other and
more valuable things-silver-mines, gold-mines, and so on."
Bondage and freedom are of the mind
587PRIYA (smiling): "Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot go forward."
MASTER: "What if the legs are chained? The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of
the mind, and freedom also is of the mind.
"Listen to a story. There were two friends. One went into a house of prostitution and the
other to hear a recital of the Bhagavata. 'What a shame!' thought the first. 'My friend is
hearing spiritual discourse, but just see what I have slipped down to!' The second friend
said to himself: 'Shame on me! My friend is having a good time, but how stupid I am!'
After death the soul of the first was taken to Vaikuntha by the messenger of Vishnu,
while that of the second was taken to the nether world of Yama."
PRIYA: "But the mind is not under my control."
MASTER: "How is that? There is such a thing as abhyiisayoga, yoga through practice.
Keep up the practice and you will find that your mind will follow in whatever direction
you lead it. The mind is like a white cloth just returned from the laundry. It will be red if
you dip it in red dye and blue if you dip it in blue. It will have whatever colour you dip it
in.
(To Goswami) "Have you anything to ask?"
GOSWAMI: "No, sir. I am satisfied that I have seen you and have been I listening to
your words."
MASTER: "Go and visit the temples."
GOSWAMI (very humbly): "Won't you please sing something about Sri Chaitanya?"
The Master complied. He sang:
Why has My body turned so golden?It is not time for this to
be:
Many the ages that must pass, before as Gaurānga I appear! . .
Again:
Gora gazes at Vrindāvan and tears stream from his eyes;
In an exuberance of joy, he laughs and weeps and dances and
sings.
He takes a wood for Vrindāvan, the ocean for the blue
Jamuna;
He rolls on the ground for love of Hari.
After singing, the Master went on with the conversation.
MASTER (to Goswami): "I have sung these songs to suit your Vaishnava temperament.
But I must sing differently when the Saktas or others come.
588"Herepeople of all sects come-Vaishnavas, Saktas, Kartabhajas,Vedantists, and also
members of the modern Brahmo Samaj. Therefore one finds here all ideals and
attitudes. It is by the will of God that different religions and opinions have come into
existence. God gives to different people what they can digest. The mother does not give
fish pilau to all her children. All cannot digest it; so she prepares simple fish soup for
some. Everyone cherishes his own special ideal and follows his own nature.
"They provide various images for the Baroari because people of different sects assemble
at it. You see there images of Radha-Krishna, Śiva-Durga, and Sita-Rāma-different
images in different places. A crowd gathers before each image. The Vaishnavas spend
most of their time before the image of Radha-Krishna, the Saktas before Śiva-Durga,
and the devotees of Rāma before Sita-Rāma.
"But it is quite different with those who are not spiritually minded at all. In the Baroari
one sees another image also-a prostitute beating her paramour with a broomstick. Those
people stand there with gaping mouths and cry to their friends: 'What are you looking at
over there? Come here! Look at this!' " (All laugh.)
Radhika Goswami saluted the Master and took his leave.
It was about five o'clock. The Master was on the semicircular west porch. Baburam, Lātu,
the Mukherji brothers, M., and some other devotees were with him.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Why should I be one-sided? The goswamis belong to
the Vaishnava school and are very bigoted. They think that their opinion alone is right
and all other opinions are wrong. My words have hit him hard. (Smiling) One must strike
the elephant on the head with the goad; that is the elephant's most sensitive spot."
Then Sri Ramakrishna told a few naughty jokes for the young men.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I don't give the youngsters a pure vegetarian diet: now and
then I give them a little water smelling of fish. Otherwise, why should they come?"
The Mukherji brothers left the porch. They went to the garden for a stroll.
MASTER (to M.): "I wonder whether the Mukherjis have taken offence at my jokes?"
M: "Why should they? Captain said that you are like a child. After realizing God a man
becomes childlike."
MASTER: "Yes, and sometimes he behaves like a boy, and sometimes like a young man.
As a boy he is very light-hearted. He may use frivolous language. As a young man he is
like a roaring lion while teaching others. You had better explain my state of mind to the
Mukherjis."
M: "I don't have to do that. Haven't they the sense to see it?"
589Again the Master became light-hearted with the boys. Then he said to one of the
devotees: "Today is the new moon. Go to the Kāli temple in the evening."
It was dusk. They heard the sound of gongs, cymbals, and other instruments used in the
evening service in. the temples. The Master said to Baburam, "Come with me to the Kāli
temple." He and Baburam went toward the temple, accompanied by M. At the sight of
Harish sitting on the porch, the Master said: "What is this? Is he in ecstasy?"
Going through the courtyard, the Master and the devotees stopped a minute in front of
the Radhakanta temple to watch the worship. Then they proceeded to the shrine of Kāli.
With folded hands the Master prayed to the Divine Mother: "O Mother! O Divine Mother!
O Brahmamayi!"
Reaching the raised platform in front of the shrine, he bowed low before the image. The
Ārati was going on. He entered the shrine and fanned the image.
The evening worship was over. The devotees bowed before the Deity. It was the night of
the new moon. The Master was in a spiritual mood. Gradually his mood deepened into
intense ecstasy. He returned to his room, reeling like a drunkard and holding to
Baburam's hand.
Master's prayer to Divine Mother
A lamp was lighted on the west porch. The Master sat there a few minutes, chanting:
"Hari Om! Hari Om! Hari Om!" and other mystic syllables of the Tantra. Presently he
returned to his room and sat on the small couch, facing the east. He was still completely.
absorbed in divine fervour. He said to the Divine Mother: "Mother, that I should first
speak and You then act-oh, that's nonsense! What is the meaning of talk? It is nothing
but a sign. One man says, 'I shall eat.' Again, another says, 'No! I won't hear of it.' Well,
Mother, suppose I had said I would not eat; wouldn't I still feel hungry? Is it ever
possible that You should listen only when one prays aloud and not when one feels an
inner longing? You are what You are. Then why do I speak? Why do I pray? I do as You
make me do. Oh, what confusion! Why do You make me reason?"
As Sri Ramakrishna was thus talking to God, the devotees listened wonder-struck to his
words. The Master's eyes fell upon them.
MASTER (to the devotees): "One must inherit good tendencies to realize God, One must
have done something, some form of tapasya, either in this life or in another.
"When Draupadi's clothes were being taken off, she cried earnestly, praying to God. God
revealed Himself to her and said: 'Try to remember whether you have ever made a gift
of a cloth to anyone. Then your modesty will be preserved.' Draupadi replied: 'Yes, I
remember now. Once a rishi was taking his bath when his loin-cloth was carried away by
the current. I tore off half my cloth and gave it to him.' Thereupon the Lord said, 'Then
you have nothing to fear.' "
M. was sitting on the small foot-rug.
590MASTER (to M.): "You have understood what I said."
M: "Yes, sir. You spoke about inherent tendencies."
MASTER: "Repeat what I said."
M. repeated the story of Draupadi.
Hazra entered the room. He had been living with Sri Ramakrishna in the temple garden
for the past two years and had first met the Master in 1880 at Sihore in the house of
Hriday, the Master's nephew. Hazra's native village was near Sihore, and he owned some
property there. He had a wife and children and also some debts. From youth he had felt
a spirit of renunciation and sought the company of holy men and devotees. The Master
had asked him to live with him at Dakshineswar and looked after his necessities. Hazra's
mind was a jumble of undigested religious moods. He professed the path of knowledge
and disapproved of Sri Ramakrishna's attitude of bhakti and his longing for the young
devotees. Now and then he thought of the Master as a great soul, but again he slighted
him as an ordinary human being. He spent much of his time in telling his beads, and he
criticized Rākhāl and the other young men for their indifference to the practice. He was a
strong advocate of religious conventions and rules of conduct, and made a fad of them.
He was about thirty-eight years old.
As Hazra came in, the Master became a little abstracted and in that mood began to talk.
MASTER (to Hazra): "What you are doing is right in principle, but the application is not
quite correct. Don't find fault with anyone, not even with an insect. As you pray to God
for devotion, so also pray that you may not find fault with anyone."
HAZRA: "Does God listen to our prayer for bhakti?"
MASTER: "Surely. I can assure you of that a hundred times. But the prayer must be
genuine and earnest. Do worldly-minded people weep for God as they do for wife and
children? At Kamarpukur the wife of a certain man fell ill. The man thought she would
not recover; he began to tremble and was about to faint. Who feels that way for God?"
Hazra was about to take the dust of the Master's feet.
MASTER (shrinking): "What is this?"
HAZRA: "Why should I not take the dust of his feet who has so kindly kept me with
him?"
MASTER: "Satisfy God and everyone will be satisfied.'If He is pleased the world is
pleased.' Once the Lord ate a few greens from Draupadi's cooking-pot and said, 'Ah, I
am satisfied.' Immediately the whole world and all its living beings were satisfied; they
felt as if they had eaten their fill. But was the world satisfied or did it feel that way when
the rishis ate their food?
591(To Hazra) "A perfect soul, even after attaining Knowledge, practises devotions or
observes religious ceremonies to set an example to others. I go to the Kāli temple and I
bow before the holy pictures in my room; therefore others do the same. Further, if a
man has become habituated to such ceremonies, he feels restless if he does not observe
them.
"One day I saw a sannyasi under the banyan-tree. He had put the salagram on the same
carpet with his guru's sandals. He was worshipping them. I said to him, 'If you have
attained Knowledge to that extent, then why such formal worship at all?' He replied:
'What difference does it make? Since I do everything else, why not this too? Sometimes
I offer the flowers at the guru's feet and sometimes to God.'
"One cannot renounce work as long as one has a body. As long as there is mud at the
bottom of the lake, bubbles will be produced.
Advice to Hazra - Scriptures and sadhana
(To Hazra) "If there is knowledge of one, there is also knowledge of many. What will you
achieve by mere study of the scriptures? The scriptures contain a mixture of sand and
sugar, as it were. It is extremely difficult to separate the sugar from the sand. Therefore
one should learn the essence of the scriptures from the teacher or from a sādhu.
Afterwards what does one care for books?
(To the devotees) "Gather all the information and then plunge in. Suppose a pot has
dropped in a certain part of a lake. Locate the spot and dive there.
"One should learn the essence of the scriptures from the guru and then practise
sadhana. If one rightly follows spiritual discipline, then one directly sees God. The
discipline is said to be rightly followed only when one plunges in. What will a man gain
by merely reasoning about the words of the scriptures? Ah, the fools! They reason
themselves to death over information about the path. They never take the plunge. What
a pity!
"You may say, even though you dive deep you are still in danger of sharks and
crocodiles, of lust and anger. But dive after rubbing your body with turmeric powder;
then sharks and crocodiles will not come near you. The turmeric is discrimination and
renunciation.
Master's spiritual practice
(To the devotees) "God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths. First
according to the Purana, then according to the Tantra. I also followed the disciplines of
the Vedas. At first I practised sadhana in the Panchavati. I made a grove of tulsi-plants
and used to sit inside it and meditate. Sometimes I cried with a longing Heart, 'Mother!
Mother!' Or I again, 'Rāma! Rāma!'
"While repeating the name of Rāma, I sometimes assumed the attitude of Hanuman and
fixed a tail to the lower end of my backbone. I was in a God-intoxicated state. At that
592time I used to put on a silk robe and worship the Deity. What joy I experienced in that
worship!
"I practised the discipline of the Tantra under the bel-tree. At that time I could see no
distinction between the sacred tulsi and any other plant. In that state I sometimes ate
the leavings from a jackal's meal, food that had been exposed the whole night, part of
which might have been eaten by snakes or other creatures. Yes, I ate that stuff.
"Sometimes I rode on a dog and fed him with luchi, also eating part of the bread myself.
I realized that the whole world was filled with God alone. One cannot have spiritual
realization without destroying ignorance; so I would assume the attitude of a tiger and
devour ignorance.
"While practising the disciplines of the Vedas, I became a sannyasi. I used to lie down in
the chandni and say to Hriday: 'I am a sannyasi. I shall take my meals here.'
"I vowed to the Divine Mother that I would kill myself if I did not see God. I said to Her:
'O Mother, I am a fool. Please teach me what is contained in the Vedas, the Puranas, the
Tantras, and the other scriptures.' The Mother said to me, 'The essence of the Vedānta is
that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory.'The Satchidananda Brahman described
in the Vedas is the Satchidananda Śiva of the Tantra and the Satchidananda Krishna of
the Purana. The essence of the Gitā is what you get by repeating the word ten times. It
is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.
"After the realization of God, how far below lie the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Purana, the
Tantra! (To Hazra) I cannot utter the word 'Om' in samādhi. Why is that? I cannot say
'Om' unless I come down very far from the state of samādhi.
"I had all the experiences that one should have, according to the scriptures, after one's
direct perception of God. I behaved like a child, like a madman, like a ghoul, and like an
inert thing.
"I saw the visions described in the scriptures. Sometimes I saw the universe filled with
sparks of fire. Sometimes I saw all the quarters glittering with light, as if the world were
a lake of mercury. Sometimes I saw the world as if made of liquid silver. Sometimes,
again, I saw all the quarters illumined as if with the light of Raman candles. So you see
my experiences tally with those described in the scriptures.
"It was revealed to me further that God Himself has become the universe and all its
living beings and the twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like the process of evolution and
involution.
"Oh, what a state God kept me in at that time! One experience would hardly be over
before another overcame me. It was like the movement of the husking-machine: no
sooner is one end down than the other goes up.
593"I would see God in meditation, in the state of samādhi, and I would see the same God
when my mind came back to the outer world. When looking at this side of the mirror I
would see Him alone, and when looking on the reverse side I saw the same God."
The devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.
(To the Mukherji brothers) "Captain is now really in the state of the sadhaka. That the
mere possession of wealth should create, attachment is by no means true. Sambhu
Mallick used to say to Hriday, 'Hridu, I have packed my things and am ready for the
journey.' I said to him: 'God forbid! Why do you say such ominous words?' 'No', replied
Sambhu. 'Please bless me that I may cast aside all these possessions and go to God.'
"God's devotees have nothing to fear. They are His own He always stands by them. Once
Duryodhana and his brothers were imprisoned by the gandharvas. It was Yudhisthira
who freed them. Yudhisthira said, 'If our relatives are placed in such a plight, then it is
our disgrace.' "
It was about nine o'clock in the evening. The Mukherji brothers were ready to return to
Calcutta. The Master left his seat and began to pace the room and the porch. He could
hear the kirtan sung in the Vishnu temple. A devotee said that Harish and Lātu were in
the singing party.
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees went to the Vishnu temple and saluted the Deity. The
brahmins belonging to the staff of the temple garden, and also the priests, the cooks,
and the servants, were singing the kirtan. He stood there a few minutes and encouraged
the singers. On the way back to his room he remarked to the devotees, "You see, some
of them polish the metal utensils and some go to houses of prostitution."
The Master returned to his room and took his seat. Presently the singers came and
bowed low before him. The Master said to them: "One should perspire, dancing and
singing the name of God, as people do earning money. I had thought of joining you in
the dancing; but I found that you did everything very well. You had flavoured the curry
with all the seasoning. What could I add? It will be nice if you sing devotional songs that
way now and then."
The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master. Their carriage was ready near the verandah
north of the room. The Master stood facing the north. On his left was the Ganges; in
front of him were the nahabat, the garden, and the kuthi; and to his right was the road
leading to the gate. The night was dark, and a devotee had brought a lantern to show
the visitors their way. One by one the devotees bowed and took the dust of the Master's
feet. The carriage seemed too heavily loaded for the horses. The Master said, "Aren't
there too many people in the carriage?"
Sri Ramakrishna remained standing. As the carriage rolled away, the devotees looked
back at the Master's face beaming with compassion and love.
594Sunday, September 21, 1884
A large number of devotees were in Sri Ramakrishna's room, among them Ram,
Mahendra Mukherji, M., and Chunilal. Chunilal had just returned from Vrindāvan, where
he had gone with Rākhāl and Balarām. The two latter were still there. Nityagopal also
was staying there. The Master began to talk with Chunilal about Vrindāvan.
MASTER: "How is Rākhāl?"
CHUNI: "He is quite well now, sir."
MASTER: "Isn't Nityagopal coming back?"
CHUNI: "He was still there when I left."
MASTER: "Who will bring your family back?"
CHUNI: "Balarām Babu told me he would arrange it with some reliable person. He didn't
mention any name."
Master praises Narayan
Sri Ramakrishna then spoke to Mahendra Mukherji about Narayan, a school-boy sixteen
or seventeen years old, who often visited the Master and was very dear to him.
MASTER: "He is quite guileless, isn't he?"
The very uttering of the word "guileless" filled the Master with great joy.
MAHENDRA: "Yes, sir. Completely guileless."
MASTER: "His mother came here the other day. I was a little frightened to see that she
was a proud woman. That day she found that Captain, you, and many others, too,
visited me. Then she must have realized that she and her son were not the only people
to come here. (All laugh.) There was some sugar candy in the room and she remarked
that it was good. That made her feel there was no scarcity of food here. I happened to
tell Baburam, in front of her, to keep some sweets for himself and Naran. Ganu's mother
said that Naran always bothered his mother for the boat hire to come here. His mother
said to me, 'Please ask Naran to consent to marry.' I replied, 'All that depends on one's
fate.' Why should I interfere? (All laugh.) Naran is indifferent to his studies. His mother
said, 'Please ask him to pay a little more attention.' So I said to Naran, 'Attend to your
studies.' Then his mother said, 'Please tell him seriously.' (All laugh.)
(To Chunilal) "Why doesn't Gopal come here?"
CHUNILAL: "He has been suffering from dysentery."
MASTER: "Is he taking any medicine?"
595Sri Ramakrishna was planning to go to a performance of the Chaitanyalila at the Star
Theatre. Mahendra Mukherji was to take him to Calcutta in his carriage. They were
talking about choosing good seats. Some suggested that one could see the performance
well from the one-rupee gallery. Ram said, "Oh, no! I shall engage a box for him." The
Master laughed. Some of the devotees said that public women took part in the play.
They took the parts of Nimai, Nitai, and others.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I shall look upon them as the Blissful Mother Herself. What
if one of them acts the part of Chaitanya? An imitation custard-apple reminds one of the
real fruit. Once, while going along a road, a devotee of Krishna noticed some babla-
trees. Instantly his mind was thrown into ecstasy. He remembered that the wood of
babla-trees was used for the handles of the spades that the garden of the temple of
Syamasundar was dug with. The trees instantly reminded him of Krishna. I was once
taken to the Maidan in Calcutta to see a balloon go up. There I noticed a young English
boy leaning against a tree, with his body bent in three places. It at once brought before
me the vision of Krishna and I went into samādhi.
"Once Chaitanyadeva was passing through a village. Someone told him that the body of
the drum used in the kirtan was made from the earth of that village, and at once he
went into ecstasy.
"Radha could not control herself at the sight of a cloud or the blue throat of a peacock. It
would at once awaken in her mind the thought of Krishna, and she would go into
ecstasy."
The Master was silent a few moments and then resumed the conversation.
MASTER: "Radha had attained mahabhava. There was no desire behind the ecstatic love
of the gopis. A true lover does not seek anything from God. He prays only for pure love.
He doesn't want any powers or miracles.
Occult powers
"It is very troublesome to possess occult powers. Nangta taught me this by a story. A
man who had acquired occult powers was sitting on the seashore when a storm arose. It
caused him great discomfort; so he said, 'Let the storm stop.' His words could not
remain unfulfilled. At that moment a ship was going full sail before the wind. When the
storm ceased abruptly the ship capsized and sank. The passengers perished and the sin
of causing their death fell to the man. And because of that sin he lost his occult powers
and went to hell.
"Once upon a time a sādhu acquired great occult powers. He was vain about them. But
he was a good man and had some austerities to his credit. One day the Lord, disguised
as a holy man, came to him and said, 'Revered sir, I have heard that you have great
occult powers.' The sādhu received the Lord cordially and offered him a seat. Just then
an elephant passed by. The Lord, in the disguise of the holy man, said to the sādhu,
'Revered sir, can you kill this elephant if you like?' The sādhu said, 'Yes, it is possible.'
596So saying, he took a pinch of dust, muttered some mantras over it, and threw it at the
elephant. The beast struggled awhile in pain and then dropped dead. The Lord said:
'What power you have! You have killed the elephant!' The sādhu laughed. Again the Lord
spoke: 'Now can you revive the elephant?' 'That too is possible', replied the sādhu. He
threw another pinch of charmed dust at the beast. The elephant writhed about a litle and
came back to life. Then the Lord said: 'Wonderful is your power. But may I ask you one
thing? You have killed the elephant and you have revived it. But what has that done for
you? Do you feel uplifted by it? Has it enabled you to realize God?' Saying this the Lord
vanished.
"Subtle are the ways of dharma. One cannot realize God if one has even the least trace
of desire. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fibre
sticking out.
"Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, if you want to realize Me, you will not succeed if you
have even one of the eight occult powers.' This is the truth. Occult power is sure to
beget pride, and pride makes one forget God.
"Once a cross-eyed rich man came here. He said to me: 'You are a paramahamsa. That
is good. You must perform a swastyayana ceremony for me.' What a small-minded
person he was! He called me a paramahamsa and yet wanted me to perform that
ceremony. To secure welfare by means of the swastyayana is to exercise occult power.
"An egotistic person cannot realize God. Do you know what egotism is like? It is like a
high mound, where rain-water cannot collect: the water runs off. Water collects in low
land. There seeds sprout and grow into trees. Then the trees bear fruit.
"Therefore I say to Hazra, 'Never think that you alone have true understanding and that
others are fools.' One must love all. No one is a stranger. It is Hari alone who dwells in
all beings. Nothing exists without Him.
"The Lord said to Prahlada, 'Ask a boon of Me.' 'I have seen You', replied Prahlada. 'That
is enough. I don't need anything else.' But the Lord insisted. Thereupon Prahlada said, 'If
You must give me a boon, let it be that those who have tortured me may not have to
suffer punishment.' The meaning of those words is that it was God who tortured
Prahlada in the form of his persecutors, and, if they suffered punishment, it would really
be God who suffered.
Divine madness
"Radha was mad with prema, ecstatic love of God. But there is also the madness of
bhakti. Hanuman's was such. When he saw Sita entering the fire he was going to kill
Rāma. Then, too, there is the madness of Knowledge. I once saw a Jnāni behaving like a
madman. He came here very soon after the temple garden was dedicated. People said
he belonged to the Brahmo Sabha of Rammohan Roy. He had a torn shoe on one foot, a
stick in one hand, and a potted mango-plant in the other. After a dip in the Ganges he
went to the Kāli temple where Haladhāri was seated. With great fervour he began to
597chant a hymn to the Divine Mother. Then he went up to a dog, held it by the ear, and
ate some of its food. The dog didn't mind. Just at that time I too was about to
experience the state of divine madness. I threw my arm around Hriday's neck and said,
'Oh, Hride! Shall I too fall into that plight?'
Master's God-intoxicated condition
"I became mad. Narayan Shastri came here and saw me roaming about with a bamboo
pole on my shoulder. He said to the people, 'Ah, he is mad!' In that state I could not
observe any caste restrictions. The wife of a low caste man used to send me cooked
greens, and I ate them.
"I touched my head and lips with the leaf-plates from which the beggars ate their food in
the guest-house of the Kāli temple. Thereupon Haladhāri said to me: 'What have you
done? You have taken the food left by beggars. How will you marry off your children?'
These words aroused my anger. Haladhāri was my cousin, older than myself. But could
that restrain me? I said to him: 'You wretch! Isn't it you who take pride in the study of
the Gitā and the Vedānta? Isn't it you who teach people that Brahman alone is real and
the world illusory? And yet you imagine that I shall beget children! May your mouth that
recites from the Gitā be blighted!'
(To M.) "You see, mere study of books avails nothing. One may recite the written part
for the drum glibly from memory, but to play the drum is exceedingly difficult."
The Master continued with the description of his divine madness:
"Once, for a few days, I was out on an excursion with Mathur Babu in his house-boat.
We took the trip for a change of air. During that trip we visited Navadvip. One day I saw
the boatmen cooking their meal and stood and watched them. Mathur said to me, 'What
are you doing there?' I replied with a smile, 'The boatmen are cooking, and their food
looks very good.' Mathur felt that I might ask the boatmen to give me a portion of their
food; so he said: 'Come away! Come away!'
"But I cannot do such a thing now. I am no longer in that mood. Now the food must be
cooked by a brahmin observing ceremonial purity, and be offered to the Deity; then only
can I eat it.
"Oh, what moods I passed through! At Kamarpukur I said to Chine Sankhari and the
other chums of my boyhood days, 'Oh, I fall at your feet and beg of you to utter the
name of Hari.' I was about to prostrate myself before them all. Thereupon Chine said,
'This is the first outburst of your divine love; so you don't see any distinction between
one man and another.' When the storm breaks and raises the dust, then mango and
tamarind trees look the same. One cannot distinguish the one from the other."
A DEVOTEE: "How can a householder keep on with his worldly duties if he is
overwhelmed by such bhakti-madness or Love-madness or Knowledge madness?"
598Two kinds of yogis
MASTER (looking at him): "There are two kinds of yogis, the 'revealed' and the 'hidden'.
The householder may be a 'hidden' yogi. None recognizes him. The householder should
renounce mentally, not outwardly."
RAM: "You talk as if you were consoling children. A householder may be a Jnāni but
never a vijnāni."
MASTER: "He may become a vijnāni in the end. But it is not good to force oneself into
renunciation."
RAM: "Keshab Sen used to say: 'Why do people go to him so much? One day he will
sting them and they will flee from him.' "
MASTER: "Why should I sting people? I say to people: 'Do this as well as that. Do your
worldly duties and call on God as well.' I don't ask them to renounce everything. (With a
smile) One day Keshab was delivering a lecture. He said, 'O Lord, grant us that we may
dive into the river of divine love and go straight to the Ocean of Satchidananda.' The
ladies were seated behind the screen. I said to Keshab, 'How can you all dive once for
all?' Pointing to the ladies, I said: 'Then what would happen to them? Every now and
then you must return to dry land. You must dive and rise alternately.' Keshab and the
others laughed.
"Hazra says to me, 'You love most those endowed with rajas, those who have great
wealth and name and fame.' If that is so, then why do I love people like Harish and
Loto? Why do I love Narendra? He can't even afford salt to season his roast banana!"
Sri Ramakrishna left his from and went toward the pine-grove talking with M. A devotee
followed them with water and towel. The Master was talking about his intended visit to
the Star Theatre. He said to M.: "What Ram says applies to rajasic people. What is the
use of reserving an expensive seat?"
About five o'clock that afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was on his way to Calcutta. M.,
Mahendra Mukherji, and a few other devotees accompanied him in Mahendra's carriage.
Thinking of God, the Master soon went into an ecstatic mood. After a long time he
regained consciousness of the world. He observed: "That fellow Hazra dares teach me!
The rascal!" After a short pause he said, "shall drink some water." He often made such
remarks in order to bring his mind down to the sense plane.
MAHENDRA (to M.): "May I get some refreshments for him?"
M: "No, he won't eat anything now."
MASTER (still in ecstatic mood): "I shall eat."
599Mahendra took the Master to his flour-mill located at Hathibagan. After a little rest Sri
Ramakrishna was to go to the theatre. Mahendra did not care to take him to his own
house, for the Master was not well acquainted with his father. Priyanath, Mahendra's
second brother, was also a devotee of the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on a cot over which a carpet had been spread, and was
engaged in spiritual talk.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Once, while listening to the various incidents of the life
of Chaitanya, Hazra said that these were manifestations of Śakti, and that Brahman, the
All-pervasive Spirit, had nothing to do with them. But can there be Śakti without
Brahman? Hazra wants to nullify the teachings of this place.
Identity of Brahman and Śakti
"I have realized that Brahman and Śakti are identical, like water and its wetness, like fire
and its power to burn. Brahman dwells in all beings as the Bibhu, the All-pervasive
Consciousness, though Its manifestation is greater in some places than in others. Hazra
says, further, that anyone who realizes God must also acquire God's supernatural
powers; that he possesses these powers, though he may or may not use them."
M: "Yes, one must have control over these supernatural powers!" (All laugh)
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, one must have them in one's grasp! How mean! He who has
never enjoyed power and riches becomes impatient for them. But a true devotee never
prays to God for them."
Sri Ramakrishna washed his face. A smoke was prepared for him. He said to M.: "Is. it
dusk now? If it is, I won't smoke. During the twilight hour of the dusk you should give up
all other activities and remember God." Saying this he looked at the hairs on his arm. He
wanted to see whether he could count them. If he could not, it would be dusk.
Master at Star Theatre
About half past eight in the evening the carriage with the Master and the devotees drew
up in front of the Star Theatre on Beadon Street. He was accompanied by M., Baburam,
Mahendra and two or three others. They were talking about engaging seats, when Girish
Chandra Ghosh, the manager of the theatre, accompanied by several officials, came out
to the carriage, greeted the Master, and took him and the party upstairs. Girish had
heard of the Master and was very glad to see him at the theatre. The Master was
conducted to one of the boxes. M. sat next to him; Baburam and one or two devotees
sat behind.
The hall was brilliantly lighted. The Master looked down at the pit and saw that it was
crowded. The boxes also were full. For every box there was a man to fan those who
occupied it. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said to M., with his childlike smile:
"Ah, it is very nice here! I am glad to have come. I feel inspired when I see so many
people together. Then I clearly perceive that God Himself has become everything."
600M: "It is true, sir."
MASTER: "How much will they charge us here?"
M: "They won't take anything. They are very happy that you have come to the theatre."
MASTER: "It is all due to the grace of the Divine Mother."
The Chaitanyalila was about to be performed. It was a play about the early life of Sri
Chaitanya, who was also known as Nimai, Gaur, Gora, and Gaurānga. The curtain rose;
the attention of the audience was fixed on the stage.
The first scene depicts a council of Sin and the Six Passions. On a forest path behind
them walk Viveka, Vairāgya, and Bhakti, engaged in conversation.
Bhakti says to her companions: "Gaurānga is born in Nadia. Therefore the vidyadharis,
the munis, and the rishis have come down to earth in disguise to pay their respects to
him."
She sings:
Blest indeed is the earth! Gora is born in Nadia!
Behold the vidyadharis, coming in chariots toadore him;
Behold the munis and rishis, who come, allured by the spell of Love.
The vidyadharis, munis, and rishis sing a hymn to Gaurānga and adore him as
an Incarnation of God.
Sri Ramakrishna watched the scene and was overpowered with divine ecstasy. He said to
M.: "Look at it! Ah! Ah!"
Sages: O Kesava, bestow Thy grace
Upon Thy luckless servants here!
O Kesava, who dost delight
To roam Vrindāvan's glades and groves!
Goddesses: O Madhava, our mind's Bewitcher!
Sweet One, who dost steal our hearts,
Sweetly playing On Thy flute!
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
Sages: O Thou Eternal Youth of Braja,
Tamer of fierce Kaliya,
Slayer of the afflicted's fear!
601Goddesses: Beloved with the arching eyes
And crest with arching peacock feather,
Charmer of Sri Radha's heart!
Sages: Govardhan's mighty Lifter, Thou,
All garlanded with sylvan flowers!
O Damodara, Kamsa's Scourge!
Goddesses: O Dark One, who dost sport in bliss
With sweet Vrindāvan's gopi maids.
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
As the vidyadharis sang the lines, Beloved with the arching eyes; And crest with arching
peacock feather!, the Master went into deep samādhi. The orchestra played on, but he
was not aware of the outer world.
Another scene: A guest has arrived at the house of Jagannath Misra, Nimai's father. The
boy Nimai plays about, singing with his friends, in a happy mood:
Tell Me, where is My blessed Vrindāvan?
Where is Mother Yaśoda?
Where Father Nanda and Brother Balai?
Where My twin cows, black and white?
Tell Me, where is My magic flute?
My friends Sudāmā and Sridāmā?
Where My Jamuna's bank, My banyan?
Where My beloved gopi maids?
Where is Radha, queen of My heart?
The guest closes his eyes while offering food to the Lord. Nimai runs to him. and eats the
food from the plate. The guest recognizes Nimai as an Incarnation of God and seeks to
please him with the Hymn of the Ten Incarnations. Before taking leave of Gaurānga's
parents he sings:
Glory to Gora, the Source of Bliss!
Hail Gaurānga, Redeemer of earth!
Help of the helpless, Life of the living,
Slayer of fear in the hearts of the fearful!
Age after age we see Thy play
New sports unfolding, moods ever new;
New waves rolling, new tales to be told.
Thou who bearest the whole world's burden,
Shower on us the nectar of Love!
Take away our grief and affliction:
602Thou in Love's pleasure-cave dost dwell.
Hope of the suffering! Chastiser of sin!
Scourge of the wicked! Victory to Thee!
Listening to the hymn, the Master was thrilled with ecstasy.
The next scene is at Navadvip on the bank of the Ganges. After bathing in the holy
water, the brahmin men and women engage in worship by the riverside. As they close
their eyes, Nimai steals their food offerings and begins to eat them. A brahmin loses his
temper and says: "You scapegrace! You rascal! You are taking away my offering for
Vishnu. Ruin will seize you." Nimai holds on to the offering and is about to run away.
Many of the women love him dearly and cannot bear to have him go away. They call to
him: "Return, O Nimai! Come back, O Nimai!" Nimai turns a deaf ear to them.
One of the women, however, knows the irresistible charm that will bring him back. She
loudly chants the name of Hari. Immediately he repeats the name of Hari and comes
back.
M. was seated beside the Master. Sri Ramakrishna could not control himself. He cried
out, "Ah!" and shed tears of love. He said to Baburam and M.: "Don't make a fuss if I fall
into an ecstatic mood or go into samādhi. Then the worldly people will take me for a
cheat."
Another scene: Nimai is invested with the sacred thread of the brahmins. He puts on the
traditional ochre robe of the sannyasi. Mother Sachi and the women of the
neighbourhood stand about while he begs for alms, singing:
Drop a morsel of food, I pray, into my begging bowl;
Alone I roam, a new-made yogi, on the highways of the world.
People of Braja, you I love, and so, time and again,
I come to you; at hunger's call I beg my food from door to
door.
The sun is low, and I must seek my home on the Jamuna's bank;
Into its waters fall my tears, as onward murmuring it flows.
The onlookers leave the stage. Nimai stands alone. The gods, in the guise of brahmin
men and women, sing his praises.
Thy body gleams like liquid moonlight;
Thou hast put on man's dwarfish form.
O Lord, Thee we salute!
Men:
Women: Bewitcher of the gopis' hearts,
Thou roamest in the shady groves
About Vrindāvan's vale.
603Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
The youths of Braja are Thy friends;
Thou curbest haughty Madan's pride.
Women: Thy love has made the gopis mad;
In ecstasy the Jamuna thrills.
Men: Narayana, Deluder of demons!
Refuge of the fear-stricken gods!
Women: O Lover of Braja, Thou dost beg
The love of Braja's comely maidens!
Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
Listening to the music, the Master went into samādhi. The curtain fell and the orchestra
played on.
A new scene: Srivas and other devotees are engaged in conversation in front of
Advaita's house. Mukunda sings:
Sleep no more! How long will you lie
In māyā's slumber locked, O mind?
Who are you? Why have you been born?
Forgotten is your own true Self.
O mind, unclose your eyes at last
And wake yourself from evil dreams;
A fool you are to bind yourself
So to the passing shows of life,
When in you lives Eternal Bliss.
Come out of the gloom, O foolish mind!
Come out and hail the rising Sun!
Sri Ramakrishna praised the voice of the singer highly.
Another scene: Nimai is staying at home. Srivas comes to visit him. First he meets
Sachi. The mother weeps and says: "My son doesn't attend to his household duties. My
eldest son, Viswarupa, has renounced the world, and my heart has ached ever since.
Now I fear that Nimai will follow in his steps."
Nimai arrives. Sachi says to Srivas: "Look at him. Tears run down his cheeks and breast.
Tell, tell me how I can free him from these notions."
At the sight of Srivas, Nimai clings to his feet and says, with eyes full of tears: "Ah me!
Revered sir, I have not yet attained devotion to Krishna. Futile is this wretched life! Tell
me, sir, where is Krishna? Where shall I find Krishna? Give me the dust of your feet with
604your blessing, that I may realize the Blue One with the garland of wild-flowers hanging
about His neck."
Sri Ramakrishna looked at M. He was eager to say something but he could not. His voice
was choked with emotion; the tears ran down his cheeks; with unmoving eyes he
watched Nimai clinging to Srivas's feet and saying, "Sir, I have not yet attained devotion
to Krishna."
Nimai has opened a school, but he cannot teach the students any longer. Gangadas, his
former teacher, comes to persuade him to direct his attention to his worldly duties. He
says to Srivas: "Listen, Srivas! We are brahmins, too, and devoted to the worship of
Vishnu. But you people are ruining Nimai's worldly prospects."
MASTER (to M.): "That is the advice of the worldly-wise: Do 'this' as well as 'that'. When
the worldly man teaches spirituality he always advises a compromise between the world
and God."
M: "Yes, sir. That is true."
Gangadas continues his argument with Nimai. He says: "Nimai, undoubtedly you are
versed in the scriptures. Reason with me. Explain to me if any other duty is superior to
worldly duties. You are a householder. Why disregard the duties of a householder and
follow others' duties?"
MASTER (to M.): "Did you notice? He's trying to persuade Nimai to make a compromise."
M: "Yes, sir."
Nimai says to Gangadas: "I am not wilfully indifferent to a householder's duties. On the
contrary, it is my desire to hold to all sides. But, revered sir, I don't know what it is that
draws me on. I don't know what to do. I want to cling to the shore but I cannot. My soul
wanders away. I am helpless. My soul constantly wants to plunge headlong into the
boundless Ocean."
MASTER: "Ah me!"
The scene changes: Nityananda has arrived at Navadvip. After a search he meets Nimai,
who, in turn, has been seeking him. When they meet, Nimai says to him: "Blessed is my
life! Fulfilled is my dream! You visited me in a dream and then disappeared."
The Master said in a voice choked with emotion, "Nimai said he had seen him in a
dream."
Nimai is in an ecstatic mood and becomes engaged in conversation with Advaita, Srivas,
Haridas, and other devotees. Nitai sings a song suited to Nimai's mood:
605Where is Krishna? Where is my Krishna?
He is not in the grove, dear friends.
Give me Krishna! Bring me my Krishna!
Radha's heart knows naught but Him.
At this song Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. He remained in that state a long time.
The orchestra played on. Gradually his mind came down to the relative plane. In the
mean time a young man of Khardaha, born in the holy family of Nityananda, had entered
the box. He was standing behind the Master's chair. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with
delight at the sight of him. He held his hand and talked to him affectionately. Every now
and then he said: "Please sit down here. Your very presence awakens my spiritual
feeling." He played tenderly with the young man's hands and lovingly stroked his face.
After he had left, Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "He is a great scholar. His father is a great
devotee of God. When I go to Khardaha to visit Syamasundar, the father entertains me
with sacred offerings such as one cannot buy even for a hundred rupees. This young
man has good traits. A little shaking will awaken his inner spirit. At the sight of him my
spiritual mood is aroused. I should have been overwhelmed with ecstasy if he had stayed
here a little longer."
The curtain rises: Nityananda is walking in a procession on the public road with his
companions, chanting the name of Hari. He meets two ruffians, Jagai and Madhai, who
are sworn enemies of all religious people. Madhai strikes Nitai with a piece of broken
pottery. Nitai is hurt and bleeds profusely, but he pays no heed, inebriated as he is with
the love of God.
Sri Ramakrishna was in an ecstatic mood.
Nitai embraces both Jagai and Madhai, and sings a song to the two ruffians:
Jagai! Madhai! Oh, come and dance,
Chanting Hari's name with fervour!
What does it matter that you struck me?
Dance, dear friends, in Hari's name!
Sing the name of our Beloved:
He will embrace you in love's rapture!
Let the heavens resound with His name!
You have not tasted true emotion:
Weep as you chant the name of Hari,
And you will see the Moon of your soul.
Hari's name would I lovingly give you;
Nitai calls you to share His love.
Nimai speaks to Sachi of his desire to enter the monastic life. His mother faints and falls
to the ground.
606At this point many in the audience burst into tears. Sri Ramakrishna remained still and
looked intently at the stage. A single tear appeared in the corner of each eye. The
performance was over.
Sri Ramakrishna was about to enter a carriage. A devotee asked him how he had
enjoyed the play. The Master said with a smile, "I found the representation the same as
the real."
The carriage proceeded toward Mahendra's mill. Suddenly, Sri Ramakrishna went into an
ecstatic mood and murmured to himself in loving tones: "O Krishna! O Krishna! Krishna
is knowledge! Krishna is soul! Krishna is mind! Krishna is life! Krishna is body!" He
continued: "O Govinda, Thou art my life! Thou art my soul!"
The carriage reached the mill. Mahendra fed the Master tenderly with various dishes. M.
sat by his side. Affectionately he said to M., "Here, eat a little." He put some sweets in
his hands.
With Mahendra and a few other devotees, Sri Ramakrishna left in the carriage for the
Dakshineswar temple garden. The Master was in a happy mood. He sang a song about
Gaurānga and Nitai. M. sang with him:
Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers!
I have heard how kind you are,
And therefore I have come to you. . .
The Master and Mahendra talked about the latter's intended pilgrimage.
MASTER (smiling): "The divine love in you is barely a sprout now. Why should you let it
wither? But come back very soon. Many a time I have thought of visiting your place. At
last I have done it. I am so happy."
MAHENDRA: "My life is indeed blessed, sir."
MASTER: "You were already blessed. Your father is also a good man. I saw him the other
day. He has faith in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana."
MAHENDRA: "Please bless me that I may have love for God."
MASTER: "You are generous and artless. One cannot realize God without sincerity and
simplicity. God is far, far away from the crooked heart."
Near Syambazar, Mahendra bade the Master good-bye, and the carriage continued on its
way.

607Chapter 29
THE DURGA PUJA FESTIVAL
Friday, September 26, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA had come to Calcutta. It was the first day of the Durga Puja, the
great religious festival, and the Hindus of the metropolis were celebrating it. The Master
intended to visit the image of the Divine Mother at Adhar's house. He also wanted to see
Shivanath, the Brahmo devotee.
It was about midday. Umbrella in hand, M. was pacing the foot-path in front of the
Brahmo Samaj temple. Two hours had passed but the Master had not yet appeared. Now
and then M. sat down on the steps of Dr. Mahalnavish's dispensary and watched the joy
and mirth of the people, young and old, who were celebrating the Puja.
A little after three the Master's carriage drove up. As soon as Sri Ramakrishna stepped
out he saluted the temple of the Brahmo Samaj with folded hands. Hazra and a few
other devotees were with him. M. bowed before the Master and took the dust of his feet.
The Master told him that he was going to Shivanath's house. A few minutes later several
members of the Brahmo Samaj came and took him to Shivanath's. But Shivanath was
not at home. Shortly afterwards Vijay Goswami, Mahalnavish, and several other Brahmo
leaders greeted the Master and took him inside the Brahmo temple.
Sri Ramakrishna was in a happy mood. He was given a seat below the altar. There the
Brahmo devotees sang their devotional music. Vijay and the Brahmo devotees sat in
front of the Master.
MASTER (to Vijay, with a smile): "I was told that you had put up a 'signboard' here that
people belonging to other faiths are not allowed to come in. Narendra, too, said to me:
'You shouldn't go to the Brahmo Samiij. You had better visit Shivanath's house.'
Master's catholicity
"But I say that we are all calling on the same God. Jealousy and malice need not be.
Some say that God is formless,and some that God has form. I say, let one man meditate
on God with form if he believes in form, and let another meditate on the formless Deity if
he does not believe in form. What I mean is that dogmatism is not good. It is not good
to feel that my religion alone is true and other religions are false. The correct attitude is
this: My religion is right, but I do not know whether other religions are right or wrong,
true or false. I say this because one cannot know the true nature of God unless one
realizes Him. Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the Formless is my Father.
Which shall I blame? Which shall I praise? The two pans of the scales are equally heavy.'
Different paths for different temperaments
"Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians, Saktas, Saivas, Vaishnavas, the Brahmajnanis of the
time of the rishis, and you, the Brahmajnanis of modern times, all seek the same object.
A mother prepares dishes to suit the stomachs of her children. Suppose a mother has
608five children and a fish is bought for the family. She doesn't cook pilau or kalia for all of
them. All have not the same power of digestion; so she prepares a simple stew for
some. But she loves all her children equally.
"Do you know my attitude? I love all the preparations of fish. I have a womanly nature
(all laugh). I feel myself at home with every dish-fried fish, fish cooked with turmeric
powder, pickled fish. And further, I equally relish rich preparations like fish-head, kalia,
and pilau. (all laugh)
"Do you know what the truth is? God has made different religions to suit different
aspirants, times, and countries. All doctrines are only so many paths; but a path is by no
means God Himself. Indeed, one can reach God if one follows any of the paths with
whole-hearted devotion. Suppose there are errors in the religion that one has accepted;
if one is sincere and earnest, then God Himself will correct those errors. Suppose a man
has set out with a sincere desire to visit Jagannath at Puri and by mistake has gone
north instead of south; then certainly someone meeting him on the way will tell him: 'My
good fellow, don't go that way. Go to the south.' And the man will reach Jagannath
sooner or later.
"If there are errors in other religions, that is none of our business. God, to whom the
world belongs, takes care of that. Our duty is somehow to visit Jagannath. (To the
Brahmos) The view you hold is good indeed. You describe God as formless. That is fine.
One may eat a cake with icing, either straight or sidewise. It will taste sweet either way.
Dogmatism condemned
"But dogmatism is not good. You have no doubt heard the story of the chameleon. A
man entered a wood and saw a chameleon on a tree. He reported to his friends, 'I have
seen a red lizard.' He was firmly convinced that it was nothing but red. Another person,
after visiting the tree, said, 'I have seen a green lizard.' He was firmly convinced that it
was nothing but green. But the man who lived under the tree said: 'What both of you
have said is true. But the fact is that the creature is sometimes red, sometimes green,
sometimes yellow, and sometimes has no colour at all.'
"God has been described in the Vedas as both with attributes and without. You describe
Him as without form only. That is one-sided. But never mind. If you know one of His
aspects truly, you will be able to know His other aspects too. God Himself will tell you all
about them. (Pointing to two or three Brahmo devotees) Those who come to your Samaj
know both this gentleman and that."
Encouragement to Vijay
Vijay still belonged to the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. He was a salaried preacher of that
organization but could not obey all its rules and regulations. He mixed with those who
believed in God with form. This was creating a misunderstanding between him and the
Brahmo authorities. Many Brahmos disapproved of his conduct. The Master suddenly
looked at Vijay and began to talk to him.
MASTER (to Vijay, smiling): "I understand that they have been finding fault with you for
mixing with those who believe in God with form. Is that true? He who is a devotee of
609God must have an understanding that cannot be shaken under any conditions. He must
be like the anvil in a blacksmith's shop. It is constantly being struck by the hammer; still
it is unshaken. Bad people may abuse you very much and speak ill of you; but you must
bear with them all if you sincerely seek God. Isn't it possible to think of God in the midst
of the wicked? Just think of the rishis of ancient times. They used to meditate on God in
the forest, surrounded on all sides by tigers, bears, and other ferocious beasts. Wicked
men have the nature of tigers and bears. They will pursue you to do you an injury.
How to deal with wicked people
"One must be careful about these few things. First, an influential man who has much
money and many men under his control. He can injure you if he wants; you must be
careful while talking to him; perhaps you may have to approve what he says. Second, a
dog. When it chases you or barks at you, you must stand still, talk to it gently, and
pacify it. Third, a bull. If it runs after you with lowered horns, you must calm it with a
gentle voice. Fourth, a drunkard. If you arouse his anger, he will abuse you, naming
fourteen generations of your family. You should say to him: 'Hello uncle! How are you?'
Then he will be mightily pleased and sit by you and smoke.
"In the presence of a wicked person I become alert. If such a man asks me whether I
have a pipe for smoking, I say, 'Yes, I have.' Some people have the nature of a snake:
they will bite you without warning. You have to discriminate a great deal in order to
avoid the bite; otherwise your passion will be stirred up to such an extent that you will
feel like doing injury in return. The companionship of a holy man is greatly needed now
and then. It enables one to discriminate between the Real and the unreal."
VIJAY: "I have no time, sir. I am entangled in my duties here."
MASTER: "You are a religious teacher. Others have holidays, but not so a religious
teacher. When the manager of an estate brings order to one part of it, the landlord
sends him to another part. So you have no leisure." (all laugh)
VIJAY (with folded hands): "Sir, please give me your blessing."
MASTER: "Now you are talking like an ignorant person. It is God alone who blesses."
VIJAY: "Revered sir, please give us some instruction."
The Master glanced around the Brahmo temple and said with a smile, "This is nice too-a
mixture of crystals and syrup. There are crystals, and there is syrup too.
"I have scored too many points and am therefore out of the game (all laugh). Do you
know the game called 'nax'? It is a game of cards, and anyone scoring above seventeen
is out of the game. Those who score fewer points-say five, seven, or ten-are clever. I
have scored too many and am out of the game.
"Once Keshab Sen gave a lecture at his house. I was present. Many people were there.
The ladies were seated behind the screen. Keshab, in the course of his talk, said, 'O God,
610please bless us that we may dive and disappear altogether in the river of bhakti.' I said
to Keshab with a smile: 'If you disappear altogether in the river of bhakti, then what will
be the fate of those behind the screen? By all means dive into the river, but you had
better come back to dry land now and then: Don't disappear in the river altogether.' At
these words Keshab and the others burst out laughing.
"Never mind. One can realize God in the world, too, if only one is sincere. 'I' and 'mine'-
that is ignorance. But, 'O God! Thou and Thine'-that is knowledge.
Advice to householders
"Live in the world like a maidservant in a rich man's house. She performs all the
household duties, brings up her master's child, and speaks of him as 'my Hari'. But in
her heart she knows quite well that neither the house nor the child belongs to her. She
performs all her duties, but just the same her mind dwells on her native place. Likewise,
do your worldly duties but fix your mind on God. And know that house, family, and son
do not belong to you; they are God's. You are only His servant.
"I ask people to renounce mentally. I do not ask them to give up the world. If one lives
in the world unattached and seeks God with sincerity, then one is able to attain Him.
(To Vijay) "There was a time when I too would meditate on God with my eyes closed.
Then I said to myself: 'Does God exist only when I think of Him with my eyes closed?
Doesn't He exist when I look around with my eyes open?' Now, when I look around with
my eyes open, I see that God dwells in all beings. He is the Indwelling Spirit of all-men,
animals and other living beings, trees and plants, sun and moon, land and water.
"Why do I seek Shivanath? He who meditates on God for many days has substance in
him, has divine power in him. Further, he who sings well, plays well on a musical
instrument, or has mastered anyone art, has in him real substance and the power of
God. This is the view of the Gitā. It is said in the Chandi that he who is endowed with
physical beauty has in him substance and the power of God. (To Vijay) Ah, what a
beautiful nature Kedār has! No sooner does he come to me than he bursts into tears. His
eyes are always red and swim in tears, like a chanabara in syrup."
VIJAY: "At Dāccā he is constantly talking about you. He is always eager to see you."
Sri Ramakrishna was about to depart. The Brahmo devotees bowed low before him and
he returned their salute. Then, getting into the carriage, he set out for Adhar's house to
see the image of the Divine Mother.
Sunday, September 28, 1884
It was the day of the Mahāshtami, the most auspicious day of the worship of Durga, the
Divine Mother. At Adhar's invitation Sri Ramakrishna had come to Calcutta to see the
holy image at his house. Before going there he went to Ram's. Many devotees, including
Narendra, Baburam, M., Niranjan, Vijay, Kedār, Ram, and Surendra, were present.
Balarām and Rākhāl were still at Vrindāvan.
611MASTER (looking at Vijay and Kedār, with a smile): "This is a nice reunion today. You
two have the same spiritual mood. (To Vijay) Well, what about Shivanath? Did you-?"
VIJAY: "Yes, sir, he heard that you had been to his house. I haven't seen him, but I sent
him word. He knows about it."
MASTER (to Vijay and the others); "Four desires have come into my mind. I shall eat fish
curry cooked with egg-plant. I shall visit Shivanath. The devotees will repeat the name
of Hari over their beads, and I shall watch them. And the Tantrik devotees will drink
consecrated wine, eight ānnās worth, on the ashtami day, and I shall watch them and
salute them."
Narendra was seated in front of the Master. He was about twenty-two years old. While
Sri Ramakrishna was talking thus his eyes fell upon his beloved disciple. At once the
Master stood up and went into samādhi. He placed one foot on Narendra's knee. He was
in a deep spiritual mood, his eyes unblinking, his mind completely unconscious of the
outer world. After a long time he came down to the relative plane of consciousness; but
he still appeared dazed, for the intoxication of divine bliss had not altogether left him.
Speaking to himself in that ecstatic state, he repeated the name of God. He said:
"Satchidananda! Satchidananda! Satchidananda! Shall I repeat that? No, it is the day of
the Divine Mother, the Giver of the bliss of divine inebriation. O Mother, full of the bliss
of divine inebriation! Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni. It is not good to keep the voice on 'ni'.
It is not possible to keep it there very long. I shall keep it on the next lower note.
Difference between ordinary men and Incarnations
"There are different planes of consciousness: the gross, the subtle, the causal, and the
Great Cause. Entering the Mahakarana, the Great Cause, one becomes silent; one
cannot utter a word.
"But an Isvarakoti, after attaining the Great Cause, can come down again to the lower
planes. Incarnations of God, and others like them, belong to the class of the Isvarakotis.
They climb up, and they can also come down. They climb to the roof, and they can come
down again by the stairs and move about on a lower floor. It is a case of negation and
affirmation. There is, for instance, the seven-storey palace of a king. Strangers have
access only to the lower apartments; but the prince, who knows the palace to be his
own, can move up and down from floor to floor. There is a kind of rocket that throws out
sparks in one pattern and then seems to go out. After a moment it makes another
pattern, and then still another. There is no end to the patterns it can make. But there is
another kind of rocket that, when it is lighted, makes only a dull sound, throws out a few
sparks, and then goes out altogether. Like this second kind, an ordinary jiva, after much
spiritual effort, can go to a higher plane; but he cannot come down to tell others his
experiences. After much effort he may go into samādhi; but he cannot climb down from
that state or tell others what he has seen there.
Nature of the ever-perfect
"There is a class of devotees, the nityasiddhas, the ever-perfect. From their very birth
they seek God. They do not enjoy anything of the world.
612Illustration of homa bird
The Vedas speak of the homa bird. It lives very high in the sky. There the mother bird
lays her egg. She lives so high that the egg falls for many days. While falling it is
hatched. The chick continues to fall. That also goes on for many days. In the mean time
the chick develops eyes. Coming near the earth, it becomes conscious of the world. It
realizes it will meet certain death if it hits the ground. Then it gives a shrill cry and
shoots up toward its mother. The earth means death, and it frightens the young bird; it
then seeks its mother. She dwells high up in the sky, and the young bird shoots straight
up in that direction. It doesn't look anywhere else.
"Those who are born as the companions of an Incarnation of God are eternally perfect.
For some of them that birth is the last.
(To Vijay) "You have both-yoga and bhoga. King Janaka also had yoga and bhoga.
Therefore he is called a rajarshi, both king and seer. Nārada was a devarshi, and
Sukadeva a brahmarshi. Yes, Sukadeva was a brahmarshi. He was not a mere Jnāni; he
was the very embodiment of Jnāna, Divine Knowledge. Whom do I call a Jnāni? A man
who has attained Knowledge and has done so after much effort. Sukadeva was the very
image of Knowledge, in other words, a form of concentrated Knowledge. He attained
Knowledge spontaneously, without any labour."
Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna came down to the normal mood. Then he talked freely with
the devotees. The Master asked Kedār to sing.
Kedār sang:
How shall I open my heart, O friend?
It is forbidden me to speak.
I am about to die, for lack of a kindred soul
To understand my misery. . . .
Kedār sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees.
Nandalal, Keshab's nephew, was also present with a few brahmo friends. They were
sitting near the Master.
MASTER (to Vijay and the other devotees): "A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine
for me; but I couldn't even touch it."
VIJAY: "Ah!"
MASTER: "I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don't have to take any
wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita. I feel as if I had drunk five
bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about
food."
NARENDRA: "As regards food, one should take whatever comes."
613MASTER: "What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant's mind. No food
can harm a Jnāni.
According to the Gitā, the Jnāni himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the
Kundalini. But that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that
I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my
state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried
by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But
nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once
in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab's house.
They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn't know whether the food was handed to me
by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little (all laugh). Rākhāl had asked me to
eat.
(To Narendra) "With you it is all right. You are in 'this' as well as in 'that'. You can eat
everything now. (To the devotees) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he
eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on 'woman and gold', though he eats
the purest food-boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee.
"Once I had a desire to eat dal cooked in a blacksmith's house. From my childhood I had
heard the blacksmiths say, 'Do the brahmins know how to cook?' I ate the dal, but it
smelt of the blacksmith. (all laugh)
"I received the Allah mantra from Govinda Rai. Rice was cooked for me with onions in
the kuthi. I ate some. I ate curry in Mani Mallick's garden house, but I felt a kind of
repulsion to it.
"When I went to Kamarpukur, Ramlal's father was frightened. He thought I might eat at
any and every house. He was frightened to think I might be expelled from the caste; so I
couldn't stay long. I came away.
"Both the Vedas and the Puranas describe pure food and conduct. But what the Vedas
and the Puranas ask people to shun as impure is extolled by the Tantra as good.
Master's divine madness
"Oh, what a state of mind I passed through! I would open my mouth, touching, as it
were, heaven and the nether world with my jaws, and utter the word 'Ma'. I felt that I
had seized the Mother, like a fisherman dragging fish in his net. Let me recite a song:
This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kāli!
For I was born under an evil star,
And one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother.
Thou must devour me first, or I myself shall eat Thee up;
One or the other it must be.
I shall besmear my hands with black, and with black my face;
614With black I shall besmear the whole of my body
And when Death seizes me, with black I shall besmear his face.
O Mother, I shall eat Thee up but not digest Thee;
I shall install Thee in my heart
And make Thee offerings with my mind.
You may say that by eating Kāli I shall embroil myself
With Kala, Her Husband, but I am not afraid;
Braving His anger, I shall chant my Mother's name.
To show the world that Ramprasad is Kāli's rightful son,
Come what may, I shall eat Thee up-Thee and Thy retinue-
Or lose my life attempting it.
"I almost became mad-such was my longing for God."
Narendra began to sing:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . .
Listening to the song, the Master again went into samādhi. Coming down to the normal
plane, he assumed the attitude of Girirani and sang the Āgamani . He sang, intoxicated
with divine love:
Tell me, my Uma, how have you fared, alone in the Stranger's house? . . .
He said to the devotees, "Today is the Mahashtami. The Mother has come; that is why I
feel such an awakening of spiritual emotion."
KEDĀR: "Lord, you are here. Are you different from the Divine Mother?"
Sri Ramakrishna looked in another direction and sang in an absent-minded mood:
Ah, friend! I have not found Him yet, whose love has driven me mad....
Again he became ecstatic and sang of the Divine Mother. As he sang, Vijay suddenly
stood up crying the name of Hari. Sri Ramakrishna, full of divine love, began to dance
with Vijay and the other devotees.
The music was over. The Master, Vijay, Narendra, and the other devotees sat down. All
eyes were fixed on Sri Ramakrishna, who began conversing with the devotees. He asked
about their health. Kedār spoke to him humbly in a soft, sweet voice. Narendra, Chunilal,
Ram, M., and Harish were sitting by the Master.
KEDĀR (humbly): "How can I get rid of my dizziness?"
MASTER (tenderly): "One gets that. I have had it myself.
615Use a little almond oil. I have heard that it cures dizziness."
KEDĀR: "I shall, sir."
MASTER (to Chunilal): "Hello! How is everything?"
CHUNILAL: "Everything is all right with us now. Balarām Babu and Rākhāl are well at
Vrindāvan."
MASTER: "Why have you sent so many sweetmeats? (To Harish) Wait a day or two
before coming to Dakshineswar. You are not well. You may fall ill again there. (To
Narayan, tenderly) Sit here. Sit by me. Come to Dakshineswar tomorrow and have your
meal there. (Pointing to M.) Come with him. (To M.) What do you say?"
M. wanted to accompany Sri Ramakrishna to Dakshineswar that very day. He became
thoughtful.
Surendra stood near Sri Ramakrishna. He was in the habit of drinking and often went to
excess. This had worried the Master greatly, but he had not asked Surendra to give up
drinking altogether. He had said to him: "Look here, Surendra! Whenever you drink
wine, offer it beforehand to the Divine Mother. See that your brain doesnt become
clouded and that you don't reel The more you think of the Divine Mother, the less you
will like to drink The Mother is the Giver of the bliss of divine inebriation. Realizing Her,
one feels a natural bliss."
The Master looked at Surendra and said, "You have had a drink." With these words he
went into samādhi. It was dusk. Regaining partial consciousness, the Master sang:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!
Drunk with a draught of celestial wine, She reels, and yet She
does not fall. . .
Then he chanted the name of Hari, clapping his hands occasionally. In a sweet voice he
said: "Hari! Hari! O mind, chant the name of Hari! Sing the name of Hari!" Then he
chanted: "Rāma! Rāma Rāma! Rāma!"
Now the Master began to pray: "O Rāma! O Rāma! I am without devotion and austerity,
without knowledge and love; I have not performed any religious rites. O Rāma, I have
taken refuge in Thee; I have taken shelter at Thy feet. I do not want creature comforts;
I do not seek name and fame. O Rāma, I do not crave the eight occult powers; I do not
care for a hundred occult powers! I am Thy servant. I have taken refuge in Thee. Grant,
O Rāma, that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet; that I may not be deluded by Thy
world-bewitching māyā! O Rāma, I have taken refuge it Thee."
As the Master prayed all eyes were turned toward him. Hearing his piteous voice, few
could restrain their tears.
616Ramchandra Dutta came in and stood near him.
MASTER: "Where have you been, Ram?"
RAM: "I was upstairs, sir."
Ram had been making arrangements for feeding the devotees on the roof of the house.
MASTER (to Ram, with a smile): "Isn't it better to stay down below that to be high up?
Water accumulates in low land but flows down from a high mound."
RAM (with a smile): "That is true, sir."
Supper was ready on the roof. Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees were taken there and
sumptuously fed. Later the Master went to Adhar's house with M., Niranjan, and others.
The Divine Mother was being worshipped there, It had been Adhar's earnest prayer that
on this sacred day Sri Ramakrishna might bless his house with his presence.
Monday, September 29, 1884
It was the third day of the Durga Puja. The Master had been awake in his room at
Dakshineswar since early morning. The morning worship in the Kāli temple was over and
the orchestra had played the morning melodies in the nahabat. Brahmans and
gardeners, basket in hand, were plucking flowers for the worship of the Divine Mother.
Bhavanath, Baburam, Niranjan, and M. had spent the night at Dakshineswar, sleeping on
the porch of the Master's room. As soon as they awoke they saw Sri Ramakrishna
dancing in an ecstatic mood. He was chanting: "Victory to Mother Durga! Hallowed be
the name of Durga!" He was naked and looked like a child as he chanted the name of the
Blissful Mother. After a few moments he said: "Oh, the bliss of divine ecstasy! Oh, the
bliss of divine drunkenness!" Then he repeatedly chanted the name of Govinda: "O
Govinda! My life! My soul!"
The devotees sat on their beds and with unwinking eyes watched Sri Ramakrishna's
spiritual mood. Hazra was living at the temple garden. Lātu was also living there to
render the Master personal service. Rākhāl was still at Vrindāvan. Narendra visited Sri
Ramakrishna now and then. He was expected that day.
The devotees washed their faces. The Master took his seat on a mat on the north
verandah. Bhavanath and M. sat beside him. Other devotees were coming in and out of
the room.
MASTER (to Bhavanath): "The truth is that ordinary men cannot easily have faith. But an
Isvarakoti's faith is spontaneous. Prahlada burst into tears while writing the letter 'ka'. It
reminded him of Krishna. It is the nature of jivas to doubt. They say yes, no doubt, but-
Oneness of Śakti and Brahman
"Hazra can never be persuaded to believe that Brahman and Śakti, that Śakti and the
Being endowed with Śakti, are one and the same. When the Reality appears as Creator,
617Preserver, and Destroyer, we call It Śakti; when It is inactive, we call It Brahman. But
really It is one and the same thing-indivisible. Fire naturally brings to mind its power to
burn; and the idea of burning naturally brings to mind the idea of fire. It is impossible to
think of the one without the other.
"So I prayed to the Divine Mother: 'O Mother! Hazra is trying to upset the views of this
place. Either give him right understanding or take him from here.' The next day he carne
to me and said, 'Yes, I agree with you.' He said that God exists everywhere as All-
pervading Consciousness."
BHAVANATH (smiling): "Did what Hazra said really make you suffer so much?"
MASTER: "You see, I am now in a different mood. I can't shout and carry on heated
discussions with people. I am not in a mood now to argue and quarrel with Hazra. Hriday
said to me at Jadu Mallick's garden house, 'Uncle, don't you want to keep me with you?'
'No,' I said, 'I am no longer in a mood to get into heated arguments with you.'
Knowledge and ignorance
"What is knowledge and what is ignorance? A man is ignorant so long as he feels that
God is far away. He has knowledge when he knows that God is here and everywhere.
Childlike faith
"When a man has true knowledge he feels that everything is filled with Consciousness.
At Kamarpukur I used to talk to Shibu, who was then a lad four or five years old. When
the clouds rumbled and lightning flashed, Shibu would say to me: 'There, uncle! They
are striking matches again!' (all laugh) One day I noticed him chasing grasshoppers by
himself. The leaves rustled in the near-by trees. 'Hush! Hush!' he said to the leaves. 'I
want to catch the grasshoppers.' He was a child and saw everything throbbing with
consciousness. One cannot realize God without the faith that knows no guile, the simple
faith of a child.
"Ah, what a state of mind I passed through! One day something bit me while I was
sitting in the grass. I was afraid it might have been a snake, and I didn't know what to
do. I had heard that if a snake bites you again immediately after its first bite, it takes
back. its own venom. At once I set out to discover the hole so that I might let the snake
bite me again. While I was searching, a man said to me, 'What are you doing?' After
listening to my story, he said, 'But the snake must bite in the very same place it has
bitten before.' Thereupon I went away. Perhaps I had been bitten by a scorpion or some
other insect.
"I had heard from Ramlal that the autumn chill was good for one's health. Ramlal had
quoted a verse to support it. One day, as I was returning from Calcutta in a carriage, I
stuck my head out of the window so that I might get all the chill. Then I fell ill." (all
laugh)
618Sri Ramakrishna entered his room and sat down. His legs were a little swollen. He asked
the devotees to feel his legs and see whether or not the pressure of their fingers made
dimples. Dimples did appear with the pressure, but the devotees said that it was
nothing.
MASTER (to Bhavanath): "Please ask Mahendra of Sinthi to see me. I shall feel better if
he reassures me."
BHAVANATH (with a smile): "You have great faith in medicine. But we haven't so much."
MASTER: "It is God who, as the doctor, prescribes the medicine. It is He who, in one
form, has become the physician. Dr. Gangaprasad asked me not to drink water at night.
I regarded his statement as the words of the Vedas. I look upon him as the physician of
heaven."
Hazra entered the room and sat down. The Master talked awhile about different things
and then said to Hazra: "You see, many people were at Ram's house yesterday. Vijay,
Kedār, and others were there. But why did I feel so deeply stirred at the sight of
Narendra? I found that Kedār belonged to the realm of Divine Inebriation."
Presently Narendra arrived, and Sri Ramakrishna was exceedingly happy. Narendra
saluted the Master and began to talk with Bhavanath and others in the room. M. was
seated near by. A long mat was spread on the floor. While talking, Narendra lay on it flat
on his stomach. The Master looked at him and suddenly went into samādhi. He sat on
Narendra's back in an ecstatic mood.
Bhavanath sang:
O Mother, ever blissful as Thou art,
Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! . . .
Sri Ramakrishna came down from the plane of samādhi. He sang:
Repeat, O mind, my Mother Durga's hallowed name!
O Gauri! O Narayani! to Thee I bow.
Thou art the day, O Mother! Thou art the dusk and the night.
As Rāma Thou drawest the bow, as Krishna Thou playest the
flute;
As Kāli all-terrible, Thou hast silenced Śiva, Thy Lord.
The ten Embodiments of Divine Śakti art Thou,
And Thou the ten Avatars; this time save me Thou must!
With flowers and vilwa-leaves did Yaśoda worship Thee,
And Thou didst bless her by placing Krishna, the Child, in her
arms.
Wherever I chance to live, O Mother, in forest or grove,
May my mind, day and night, dwell at Thy Lotus Feet;
Whether at last I die a natural or sudden death,
Oh, may my tongue repeat Durga's name at the end!
619Thou mayest send me away, O Mother, but where shall I go?
Tell me, Mother, where else shall I hear so sweet a name?
Thou mayest even say to me: "Step aside! Go away!"
Yet I shall cling to Thee, O Durga! Unto Thy feet
As Thine anklets I shall cling, making their tinkling sound.
When, O Mother, Thou sittest at mighty Śiva's side,
Then I shall cry from Thy feet, "Victory unto Śiva!"
Mother, when as the Kite, Thou soarest in the sky,
There, in the water beneath, as a minnow I shall be swimming;
Upon me Thou wilt pounce, and pierce me through with Thy
claws.
Thus, when the breath of life forsakes me in Thy grip,
Do not deny me the shelter of Thy Lotus Feet!
From the world's bondage free me, 0 Spouse of the Absolute!
Thy two feet are my boat to cross this world's dark sea.
Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world;
From Thee have the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Brahma
sprung.
Whoever treads the path, repeating "Durga! Durga!"
Śiva Himself protects with His almighty trident.
Hazra was sitting on the northeast verandah counting the beads of his rosary. The
Master went and sat in front of him, taking the rosary in his own hands.
MASTER (to Hazra): "You see, I cannot use the rosary. No, perhaps I can. Yes, I can
with my left hand. But I cannot repeat the name of God with it."
With these words Sri Ramakrishna tried to perform a little japa. But hardly had he begun
when he went into samādhi. He sat in that state a long time, still holding the rosary in
his hand. The devotees looked at him with wonder in their eyes. Hazra also watched the
Master without uttering a word. After a long time Sri Ramakrishna regained
consciousness of the outer world and said that he was hungry. He often said such things
to bring his mind down to the normal plane. M. was going to bring something for him to
eat. The Master said, "No, I shall first go to the Kāli temple."
He went across the cement courtyard toward the Kāli temple. On the way he bowed with
folded hands to the twelve Śiva temples. On the left was the temple of Radhakanta. He
went there first and bowed before the image. Then he entered the Kāli temple and
saluted the Mother. Sitting on a carpet, he offered flowers at the Mother's holy feet. He
also placed a flower on his own head. While returning from the temple he asked
Bhavanath to carry the green coconut offered at the temple, and the charanamrita.
Coming back to his room, accompanied by M. and Bhavanath, he saluted Hazra, who
cried out in dismay: "What are you doing, sir? What is this?" The Master said, "Why
should you say it is wrong?" Hazra often argued with the Master, declaring that God
dwelt in all beings and that everybody could attain Brahmajnana through sadhana. He
had an exaggerated idea of his own spiritual progress.
620It was about noon. The gong and the bells announced the worship and offering in the
various temples. The brahmins, the Vaishnavas, and the beggars went to the guest-
house to have their midday meal. The devotees of the Master were also to partake of the
sacred offerings. He asked them to go to the guest-house. To Narendra he said: "Won't
you take your meal in my room? All right. Narendra and I will eat here." Bhavanath,
Baburam, M., and the other devotees went to the guest-house.
After his meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a few minutes. The devotees were on the
verandah engaged in light conversation. He soon joined them and was happy in their
company. It was about two o'clock. All were, still sitting on the verandah, when suddenly
Bhavanath appeared in the garb of a brahmachari, dressed in an ochre cloth, kamandalu
in hand, his face beaming with smiles.
MASTER (with a smile): "That is his inner feeling. Therefore he has dressed himself as a
brahmachari"
NARENDRA: "He has put on the garb of a brahmachari; let me put on the garb of' a
Tantrik worshipper."
HAZRA: "Then you will have to follow the Tantrik rituals, with women, wine, and so on."
Sri Ramakrishna did not encourage the conversation. Indeed, he made fun of it.
Suddenly the Master began to dance in an ecstatic mood. He sang:
Mother, Thou canst not trick me any more,
For I have seen Thy crimson Lotus Feet. . . .
The Master said: "Ah, how wonderfully Rajnarayan sings about the Divine Mother! He
sings and dances that way. The music of Nakur Āchārya at Kamarpukur is also
wonderful. Ah, how beautiful his singing and dancing are!"
A sādhu was staying at the Panchavati. But he was a hot-tempered man; he scolded and
cursed everyone. He came to the Master's room wearing wooden sandals and asked the
Master, "Can I get fire here?" Sri Ramakrishna saluted him and stood with folded hands
as long as he remained in the room.
When he had left, Bhavanath said to the Master with a laugh, "What great respect you
showed the sādhu!"
MASTER (smiling): "You see, he too is Narayana, though full of tamas. This is the way
one should please people who have an excess of tamas. Besides, he is a sādhu."
The devotees were engaged in a game of golokdham. Hazra joined them. The Master
stood by, watching them play. M. and Kishori reached "heaven". Sri Ramakrishna bowed
before them and said, "Blessed are you two brothers." He said to M., aside, "Don't play
any more." Hazra fell into "hell". The Master said: "What's the matter with Hazra?
621Again!" No sooner had Hazra got out of "hell" than he fell into it again. All burst into
laughter. Lātu, at the first throw of the dice, went to "heaven" from "earth". He began to
cut capers of joy. "See Lātu's joy!" said the Master. "He would have been terribly sad if
he hadn't achieved this. (Aside to the devotees) This too has a meaning. Hazra is so vain
that he thinks he will triumph over all even in this game. This is the law of God, that He
never humiliates a righteous person. Such a man is victorious everywhere."
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his room. Narendra, Baburam,
Bhavanath, and M. were sitting on the floor. Narendra referred to various religious sects-
the Ghoshpara, Panchanami, and others. Sri Ramakrishna described their views and
condemned their immoral practices. He said that they could not follow the right course of
spiritual discipline, but enjoyed sensuous pleasures in the name of religion.
Danger of Tantrik discipline
MASTER (to Narendra): "You need not listen to these things. The bhairavas and the
bhairavis of the Tantrik sect also follow this kind of discipline. While in Benares I was
taken to one of their mystic circles. Each bhairava had a bhairavi with him. I was asked
to drink the consecrated wine, but I said I couldn't touch wine. They drank it. I thought
perhaps they would then practise meditation and japa. But nothing of the sort. They
began to dance. I was afraid they might fall into the Ganges: the circle had been made
on its bank. It is very honourable for husband and wife to assume the roles of bhairava
and bhairavi.
(To Narendra and the others) "Let me tell you this. I regard woman as my mother; I
regard myself as her son. This is a very pure attitude. There is no danger in it. To look
on woman as a sister is also not bad. But to assume the attitude of a 'hero', to look on
woman as one's mistress, is the most difficult discipline. Tārak's father followed this
discipline. It is very difficult. In this form of sadhana one cannot always maintain the
right attitude.
"There are various paths to reach God. Each view is a path. It is like reaching the Kāli
temple by different roads. But it must be said that some paths are clean and some dirty.
It is good to travel on a clean path.
"Many views, many paths-and I have seen them all. But I don't enjoy them any more;
they all quarrel.
Master's inner experiences
"No one else is here, and you are my own people. Let me tell you something. I have
come to the final realization that God is the Whole and I am a part of Him, that God is
the Master and I am His servant. Furthermore, I think every now and then that He is I
and I am He."
The devotees listened to these words in deep silence.
622BHAVANATH (humbly): "I feel disturbed if I have a misunderstanding with someone. I
feel that in that case I am not able to love all"
MASTER: "Try at the outset to talk to him and establish a friendly relationship with him.
If you fail in spite of your efforts, then don't give it another thought. Take refuge in God.
Meditate on Him. There is no use in giving up God and feeling depressed from thinking
about others."
BHAVANATH: "Great souls, such as Christ and Chaitanya, have admonished us to love all
beings."
MASTER: "Love you must, because God dwells in all beings. But salute a wicked person
from a distance. You speak of Chaitanya? He also used to restrain his spiritual feeling in
the presence of unsympathetic people. At Srivas's house he put Srivas's mother-in-law
out of the room, dragging her out by the hair."
BHAVANATH: "It was not he but others who did it."
MASTER: "Could the other have done it
Suppose a man cannot make another love
Must I waste my mind, which should be
Mother, I don't want Narendra, Bhavanath,
shall I do with man?'
without his approval? What can be done?
him; must he worry about it day and night?
given to God, on useless things? I say: 'O
Rākhāl, or anybody. I seek Thee alone. What
When the Blissful Mother comes to my house, how much of the Chandi I shall hear!
How many monks will come here, and how many yogis with matted locks!
"When I attain God I shall attain everything. I renounced gold and silver, saying, 'Rupee
is clay and clay is rupee; gold is clay and clay is gold.' With these words I threw gold,
silver, and clay into the Ganges. Then I was afraid at the thought that Mother Lakshmi
might be angry with me because I had treated Her wealth with contempt; that She
might even stop my meals. So I prayed to the Divine Mother, 'O Mother, I want Thee
and nothing else.' I knew that by realizing Her I should get everything."
BHAVANATH (smiling): "This is the shrewd calculation of a business man."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, that is so. Once the Lord was pleased with a certain devotee.
He appeared before him and said: 'I am very much pleased with your austerities. Ask a
boon of Me.' The devotee said, 'O Lord, if You are gracious enough to give me a boon,
then please grant that I may eat from gold plates with my grandchildren.' One boon
covered many things-wealth, children, and grandchildren." (all laugh)
Hazra was sitting on the verandah.
623MASTER: "Do you know what Hazra wants? He wants money. His family is in distress; he
has debts. He thinks that God will give him money because he devotes himself to japa
and meditation."
A DEVOTEE: "Can't God fulfil a devotee's desire?"
MASTER: "If it is His sweet will. But God doesn't take entire responsibility for a devotee
unless the devotee is completely intoxicated with ecstatic love for Him. At a feast it is
only a child whom one takes by the hand and seats at his place. Who does that with
older people? Not until a man thinks so much of God that he cannot look after himself
does God take on his responsibilities. Hazra doesn't inquire about his family. His son said
to Ramlal: 'Please ask father to come home. We shall not ask anything of him.' These
words almost brought tears to my eyes. Hazra's mother said to Ramlal: 'Please ask
Pratap to come home just once. Also ask your uncle to request him to come home.' I
told him about it, but he didn't listen to me.
Duty toward mother
"Is a mother to be trifled .with? Before becoming a sannyasi Chaitanyadeva worked hard
to persuade his mother to let him renounce home. Mother Sachi said that she would kill
Keshab Bharati. Chaitanyadeva did his utmost to persuade her. He said: 'Mother, I shall
not renounce home if you won't let me. But if you compel me to lead a householder's
life, I shall die. And, mother, even if I go away as a sannyasi, you will be able to see me
whenever you desire. I shall stay near you. I shall see you every now and then.' Only
when Chaitanya explained it to her thus did she give her permission. Nārada could not
go to the forest to practise austerity as long as his mother was alive. He had to take care
of her. After her death he went away to realize God.
"When I went to Vrindāvan I felt no desire to return to Calcutta. It was arranged that I
should live with Gangama. Everything was settled. My bed was to be on one side and
Gangama's on the other. I resolved not to go back to Calcutta. I said to myself, 'How
long must I eat a kaivarta's food?' 'No,' said Hriday to me, 'let us go to Calcutta.' He
pulled me by one hand and Gangama pulled me by the other. I felt an intense desire to
live at Vrindāvan. But just then I remembered my mother. That completely changed
everything. She was old. I said to myself: 'My devotion to God will take to its wings if I
have to worry about my mother. I would rather live with her. Then I shall have peace of
mind and be able to meditate on God.'
(To Narendra) "Why don't you say a few words to Hazra about going home? The other
day he said to me, 'Yes, I shall go home and stay there three days.' But now he has
forgotten all about it.
(To the devotees) "We have talked about filthy things-Ghoshpara and things like that.
Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Now chant the name of Hari. Let there be a dish of rice
pudding and sweets after the ordinary lentils."
Narendra began to sing:
624Fasten your mind, O man, on the Primal Purusha,
Who is the Cause of all causes,
The Stainless One, the Beginningless Truth.
As Prana He pervades the infinite universe;
The man of faith beholds Him,
Living, resplendent, the Root of all.
Beyond the senses, eternal, the Essence of Consciousness,
He shines in the cave of the heart,
Adorned with Holiness, Wisdom, and Love;
By meditating on Him, man is delivered from grief.
Of countenance ever serene,
An inexhaustible Ocean of Virtue,
None can fathom His depths; yet freely, of His own grace,
Does He reveal Himself
To those who come to His feet for shelter,
Merciful since they are helpless and He is the Ever-forgiving,
The Giver of happiness,
The Ready Help in the sea of our woe.
Unswervingly just, bestowing the fruits of our deeds, good and
ill,
Yet is He the Fount of Compassion,
The Ocean of Mercy brimming with Love;
Even to hear of His glory suffuses the eyes with tears.
Gaze on His face and be blest:
Your heart is hungry for Him, O man!
Bright with unspeakable beauty, peerless and without stain,
No words can ever describe Him;
Be as a beggar before His gate
And worship Him day and night, beseeching Him for His
grace.
He sang again:
In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full,
And Love's Hood-tide, in surging waves, is flowing everywhere.
O Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee!
On every side shine devotees, like stars around the moon;
Their Friend, the Lord All-merciful, joyously plays with them.
Behold! the gates of paradise today are open wide. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna was dancing in a circle. The devotees joined him. They all sang and
danced. Their bliss was indescribable. The Master sang about the Divine Mother:
Behold my Mother playing with Śiva, lost in an ecstasy of joy!...
625Sri Ramakrishna was highly pleased because M. had joined in the music. He said to M.,
with a smile, "The atmosphere would have been more intense with divine fervour if a
drum had accompanied the music and played: 'Tak tak ta dhina! Dak dak da dhina!' "
It was dusk when the kirtan was finished.

Master at Adhar's house
Sri Ramakrishna had set out from Dakshineswar for Adhar's house in Calcutta. Narayan
and Gangadhar were with him. In the carriage, in an ecstatic mood, he said: "Shall I
count the beads? How shameful that would be! This emblem of Śiva has sprung from the
bowels of the earth; it is self created and not set up by man's hands."
They arrived at Adhar's house, where many devotees, including Kedār, Baburam, and
Vijay, had assembled. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, was present. At the Master's
behest, Adhar heard Vaishnavcharan's music daily after his return from the office.
When the Master entered Adhar's drawing-room the devotees stood up to receive him.
Kedār and Vijay saluted him, and the Master asked Narayan and Baburam to salute
Kedār and Vijay. He asked Kedār and Vijay to bless Narayan and Baburam that they
might have devotion to God. Pointing to Narayan he said, "He is utterly guileless." The
eyes of the devotees were fixed on the two boys.
MASTER (to Kedār and the other devotees): "It is good that I have met you all here;
otherwise perhaps you would have come to the Kāli temple to see me. Through the will
of God, however, we have met here."
KEDĀR (with folded hands): "The will of God! It is all your will."
Sri Ramakrishna smiled. Vaishnavcharan began a kirtan about Radha and Krishna. When
the music was nearing its end, with the union of Radha and Krishna, the Master began to
dance with ecstatic fervour. The devotees danced and sang around him. After the music
they all sat down. The Master said to Vijay, referring to Vaishnavcharan, "He sings very
well." He asked the musician to sing the song about Sri Chaitanya, beginning with the
line, "The beautiful Gaurānga, the youthful dancer, fair as molten gold."
When the song was over, the Master asked Vijay, "How did you like it?"
VIJAY: "Wonderful."
Sri Ramakrishna also sang a song about Sri Chaitanya, M. joining him. Then
Vaishnavcharan sang another song:
O my flute, sing Hari's name!
You cannot know the highest Truth
Without Lord Hari's grace.
626His name removes our bitter grief:
Repeat the name of Hari, then,
Repeat Sri Krishna's holy name!
If He bestows His grace on me,
No longer shall be afraid
Of this unfriendly world;
Sing then Lord Hari's name, my flute!
Our only treasure is His name.
Govinda says: Behold, my days
Are passing by in vain:
In the world's deep and shoreless sea,
Oh, let me not be drowned!
Vaishnavcharan sang again, this time about Mother Durga:
O tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga;
Who but your Mother Durga will save you in distress? . . .
The Master and the musician sang again and again the following lines from the song:
The moving and the unmoving, the gross and the subtle, art
Thou:
Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution.
Thou art the Primal Root of this manifold universe:
The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou;
Thou art the Śakti of all, and Thou Thine own Śakti, too.
Kedār and several devotees stood up. They were about to return home. Kedār saluted
the Master and bade him good-bye.
MASTER: "Should you go away without bidding Adhar good-bye? Wouldn't that be an act
of discourtesy?"
KEDĀR: "'When God is pleased, the world is pleased.' You are staying; so in a sense we
are all staying. I am not feeling well. Besides, I am a little nervous about my social
conventions. Once before I had trouble with our community."
VIJAY: (pointing to the Master): "Should we go away and leave him here?"
Just then Adhar came in to take the Master to the dining-room, for the meal was ready.
Sri Ramakrishna stood up and said, addressing Kedār and Vijay: "Come. Come with me."
They followed him and partook of the dinner together with the other devotees.
After dinner they all returned to the drawing-room, where the devotees sat around the
Master. Kedār said to him with folded hands, 'Please forgive me for hesitating to eat
here.' Perhaps the thought had come to his mind that he should not have hesitated,
since the Master himself had no scruples about eating at Adhar's house.
627Kedār worked at Dāccā. Many devotees brought offerings of sweets and other food for
him. Referring to this, Kedār said to the Master: "People want to give me food. What
should I do? Lord, what is your command in this matter?"
MASTER: "One can eat food even from an untouchable if the untouchable is a devotee of
God. After spending seven years in a God-intoxicated state at Dakshineswar, I visited
Kamarpukur. Oh, what a state of mind I was in at that time! Even a prostitute fed me
with her own hands. But I cannot allow that now."
Kedār was about to take his leave.
KEDĀR (in a low voice): "Lord, please transmit power to me. Many people come to me.
What do I know?"
MASTER: "Everything will be all right. One gets along well if one is sincerely devoted to
God."
Yogendra, the editor of a Bengali paper, the Bangavasi, entered the room. The
conversation turned to the Personal God and God without form.
MASTER: "God has form; again, He is formless. How many aspects He has! We cannot
comprehend Him. Why should we say that God is formless only?"
YOGENDRA: "That is the one amazing thing about the Brahmo Samaj. There even a boy
twelve years old sees God as formless. The members of the Adi Samaj do not object
very much to God with form. They are allowed to attend ritualistic worship if it takes
place in respectable families."
MASTER (smiling): "How nicely he has put it! Even a boy sees the formless God!"
ADHAR: "Shivanath Babu does not believe in God's forms."
VIJAY: "That is his mistake. (Pointing to the Master) As he says, the chameleon assumes
different colours-now this colour, now that. Only the man who lives under the tree knows
the animal's true colour.
"While meditating I saw images of gods painted on a canvas. How many gods! How
many different things they said! I said to myself: 'I shall go to the Master. He will explain
it all to me.' "
MASTER: "You saw correctly."
KEDĀR: "God assumes forms for the sake of His devotees. Through ecstatic love a
devotee sees God with form. Dhruva had a vision of the Lord. He said: 'Why don't your
ear-rings move?' The Lord said, 'They will move if you move them.' "
628MASTER: "One must accept everything: God with form and God without form. While
meditating in the Kāli temple I noticed Ramani, a prostitute. I said, 'Mother, I see that
Thou art in that form too.' Therefore I say one must accept everything. One does not
know when or how God will reveal Himself."
The Master sang:
A mendicant has come to us, ever absorbed in divine moods. . .
VIJAY: "God has infinite power. Can He not reveal Himself in any form He chooses? Man
is a speck of dust, and he dares come to a conclusion about God. How amazing!"
MASTER: "A man reads a little of the Gitā, the Bhagavata, or the Vedānta and thinks he
has understood everything. Once an ant went to a hill of sugar. One grain of sugar filled
its stomach, and it was returning home with another grain in its mouth. On the way it
said to itself, 'The next time I go, I shall bring home the whole hill.' "(All laugh)

629Chapter 30
THE MASTER IN VARIOUS MOODS
Thursday, October 2, 1884
SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar. Lātu, Ramlal, Harish, and
Hazra were living with him at the temple garden. Baburam spent a day or two with him
now and then.
Manilal Mallick, Priya Mukherji and his relative Hari, a bearded Brahmo devotee from
Shibpur, and several Mārwāri devotees from Calcutta were in the Master's room. Manilal
was an old member of the Brahmo Samaj.
MASTER (to Manilal and the others): "It is wise to salute a person mentally. What need
is there of touching his feet? Mental salutation doesn't embarrass anybody.
"The attitude that my religion alone is right and all other religions are false is not good. I
see that God Himself has become all these: men; images, and salagram. I see one alone
in all these; I do not see two. I see only one.
"Many people think that their opinion alone is right and others' opinions are wrong; that
they alone have won and others have lost. But a person who has gone forward may be
detained by some slight obstacle, and someone who has been lagging behind may then
steal a march on him. In the game of golokdham one may advance a great deal, but still
somehow one's piece may fail to reach the goal.
Inscrutability of God's ways
"Triumph or defeat is in the hands of God. We cannot understand His ways. You must
have noticed that the green coconut remains high in the tree and is exposed to the sun,
but still its milk is cool. On the other hand the paniphal remains in the water, but when
eaten it heats the body.
"Look at the body of man. The head is the root, and it is at the top."
Two ways of Yoga
MANILAL: "What then is our duty?"
MASTER: "To remain somehow united with God. There are two ways: karmayoga and
manoyoga. Householders practise yoga through karma, the performance of duty.
There are four stages of life: brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanaprastha, and sannyās.
Sannyāsis must renounce those karmas which are performed with special ends in view;
but they should perform the daily obligatory karmas, giving up all desire for results.
Sannyāsis are united with God by such karmas as the acceptance of the staff, the
receiving of alms, going on pilgrimage, and the performance of worship and japa.
630"It doesn't matter what kind of action you are engaged in. You can be united with God
through any action provided that, performing it, you give up all desire for its result.
"There is the other path: manoyoga. A yogi practising this discipline doesn't show any
outward sign. He is inwardly united with God. Take Jadabharata and Sukadeva, for
instance. There are many other yogis of this class, but these two are well known. They
shave neither hair nor beard.
"All actions drop away when a man reaches the stage of the paramahamsa. He always
remembers the ideal and meditates on it. He is always united with God in his mind. If he
ever performs an action it is to teach men.
"A man may be united with God either through action or through inwardness of thought,
but he can know everything through bhakti. Through bhakti one spontaneously
experiences kumbhaka. The nerve currents and breathing calm down when the mind is
concentrated. Again, the mind is concentrated when the nerve currents and breathing
calm down. Then the buddhi, the discriminating power, becomes steady. The man who
achieves this state is not himself aware of it.
Efficacy of bhakti-yoga
"One can attain everything through bhakti yoga. I wept before the Mother and prayed,
'O Mother, please tell me, please reveal to me, what the yogis have realized through
yoga and the jnanis through discrimination.' And the Mother has revealed everything to
me. She reveals everything if the devotee cries to Her with a yearning heart. She has
shown me everything that is in the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Puranas, and the Tantra."
MANILAL: "And what about hathayoga?"
MASTER: "The hathayogis identify themselves with their bodies. They practise internal
washing and similar disciplines, and devote themselves only to the care of the body.
Their ideal is to increase longevity. They serve the body day and night. That is not good.
Householder's duty
"What is your duty? You should renounce 'woman and gold' mentally. You cannot look on
the world as crow-droppings.
"The goswamis are householders. Therefore I said to them: 'You have your duties in the
temple; how can you renounce the world? You cannot explain away the world as māyā.'
"Chaitanyadeva said that the duties of householders were kindness to living beings,
service to the Vaishnavas, and the chanting of God's holy name.
"Keshab Sen once said about me: 'Now he asks us to hold to both-God and the world.
But one day he will sting us.' No, that is not true. Why should I sting?"
MANI MALLICK: "But, sir, you do."
631MASTER (smiling): "How so? You are a householder. Why should you renounce?
Complete renunciation for religious teachers
"But the renunciation of the world is needful for those whom God wants to be teachers of
men. One who is an Āchārya should give up 'woman and gold'; otherwise people will not
take his advice. It is not enough for him to renounce only mentally; he should also
renounce outwardly. Only then will his teaching bear fruit. Otherwise people will think,
'Though he asks us to give up "woman and gold," he enjoys them himself in secret.'
"A physician prescribed medicine for a patient. and said to him, 'Come another day and
I'll give you directions about diet.' The physician had several jars of molasses in his room
that day. The patient lived very far away. He visited the physician later and the physician
said to him: 'Be careful about your food. It is not good for you to eat molasses.' After the
patient left, another person who was there said to the physician: 'Why did you give him
all the trouble of coming here again? You could very well have given him the instructions
the first day.' The physician replied with a smile: There is a reason. I had several jars of
molasses in my room that day. If I had asked the patient then to give up molasses, he
would not have had faith in my words. He would have thought: "He has so many jars of
molasses in his room, he must eat some of it. Then molasses can't be so bad." Today I
have hidden the jars. Now he will have faith in my words.
"I have seen the Āchārya of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. I understand that he has married for
the second or third time. He has grown-up children. And such men are teachers! If they
say, 'God is real and all else illusory', who will believe them? You can very well
understand who will be their disciples.
Hard rules for a sannyāsi
"Like teacher, like disciple. Even if a sannyāsi renounces 'woman and gold' mentally, but
lives with them outwardly, he cannot be a teacher of men. People will say that he enjoys
'molasses' secretly.
"Once Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi gave five rupees to Ramlal. I didn't know about it.
When Ramlal told me about the money, I asked him, 'For whom was the money given?'
He said it was for me. At first I thought that I should use it to pay what I owed for my
milk, But will you believe me? I had slept only a little while when I suddenly woke up
writhing with pain, as if a cat were scratching my chest. I went to Ramlal and asked him
again, 'Was the money given for your aunt?' 'No', Ramlal answered. Thereupon I said to
him, 'Go at once and return the money.' Ramlal gave it back the next day.
"Do you know how it looks for a sannyāsi to accept money or to be attached to an object
of temptation? It is as if a brahmin widow who had practised continence and lived on
simple boiled rice and vegetables and milk for many years, were suddenly to accept an
untouchable as her paramour. (All look stunned.)
"There was a low-caste woman named Bhagi Teli in our part of the country. She had
many disciples and devotees. Finding that she, a sudra, was being saluted by people, the
632landlord became jealous and engaged a wicked man to tempt her. He succeeded in
corrupting her and all her spiritual practice came to nothing. A fallen sannyāsi is like
that.
"You are leading householders' lives. It is necessary for you to live in the company of
holy men. First of all, the company of holy men; then sraddha, faith in God.
"How can people have reverence and faith in God if the holy men do not sing His name
and glories? People respect a man if they know that in his family there have been royal
ministers for three generations.
(To M.) "Even if one has attained Knowledge, one must still constantly practise God-
Consciousness. Nangta used to say: 'What is the use of polishing the outside of a metal
pot one day only? If you don't polish it regularly it will get tarnished again.' I shall have
to go to your house some time. If I know your house I can meet other devotees there.
Please go to see Ishan some time.
(To Manilal) "Keshab Sen's mother came here the other day. The young boys of her
family sang the name of Hari. She went around them clapping her hands. I noticed she
was not very much stricken with grief over Keshab's death. She observed the fast of
ekadasi here and counted her beads. I was pleased to see her devotion to God."
About Keshab and Vijay
MANILAL: "Ramkamal Sen, Keshab Babu's grandfather, was a devotee of God. He used
to sit in a tulsi-grove and repeat God's holy name. Pyarimohan, Keshab's father, was
also a Vaishnava devotee."
MASTER: "The son could not have been so devoted to God if the father had not been like
that. Look at Vijay. His father would become unconscious of the world in divine ecstasy
while reading the Bhagavata. Vijay can hardly control his emotion: while uttering Hari's
name, he sometimes stands up from his seat. The forms of God that Vijay sees
nowadays are all real. Speaking about the different aspects of God, formless and with
form, Vijay said that God sometimes appears with attributes and sometimes without
attributes. He gave the example of the chameleon, which sometimes turns red,
sometimes blue, sometimes green, and sometimes remains colourless.
Praise of guilelessness and purity
"Vijay is really guileless. One cannot realize God without being guileless and liberal-
minded. Yesterday Vijay was at Adhar Sen's house. He behaved as if it were his own
place and those who lived there his own people. One cannot be guileless and liberal-
minded unless one is free from worldliness."
Then the Master sang:
You will attain that priceless Treasure when your mind is free from stain. . . .
633He continued: "You cannot make a pot without first carefully preparing the clay. The pot
will crack if the clay contains particles of sand or stone. That is why the potter first
prepares the clay by removing the sand and stones.
"If a mirror is covered with dirt, it won't reflect one's face. A man cannot realize his true
Self unless his heart is pure. You will find guilelessness wherever God incarnates Himself
as man. Nandaghosh, Daśaratha, Vasudeva -all of them were guileless.
"The Vedānta says that a man does not even desire to know God unless he has a pure
mind. One cannot be guileless and liberal-minded without much tapasya or unless it is
one's last birth."
Master's guilelessness
Sri Ramakrishna was worrying, like a child, because he thought his legs were slightly
swollen. Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi entered the room and. saluted the Master.
MASTER (to the devotees): "Yesterday I said to Naran, 'Just press your leg and see if
there is any dimple.' He pressed it and there was one. Then I
gave a sigh of relief. (To Mukherji) Will you please press your leg? Is there any dimple?"
MUKHERJI: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Ah, what a relief!"
MANI MALLICK: "Why should you worry about it, sir? Please take your bath in the river.
Why should you take medicine?"
MASTER: "No, sir. You have strong blood. Your case is different. The Divine Mother has
placed me in the state of a child. One day I was bitten by something in the jungle. I had
heard people say that, in case of snakebite, the poison would come out if the snake bit
again. So I put my hand in a hole and waited. A man passing by said to me: 'What are
you doing? You will get rid of the poison only if the snake bites again in the same place.
You will not be cured if the snake bites another part of your body.'
"I was told that the autumn dew was good. One day, while coming from Calcutta, I stuck
my head out of the carriage and exposed it to the damp air. (All laugh.)
(To Mahendra of Sinthi) "That pundit from Sinthi is very good. He holds a title for this
scholarship. He respects me. I said to him, 'You have read a great deal; but give up the
vanity that you are a scholar.' That made him very happy. I discussed Vedānta with him.
Nature of Brahman
(To M.): "That which is Pure Ātman is unattached. Māyā, or avidyā, is in It. In māyā
there are three Gunās : sattva, rajas, and tamas. These three Gunās also exist in the
Pure Ātman. But Ātman Itself is unattached. If you throw a blue pill into the fire, you will
634see a blue flame. If you throw a red pill, you will see a red flame. But fire itself has no
colour of its own.
"If you put a blue pill in water, the water will turn blue. Again, if you put alum in that
water, it will regain its natural colour.
"A butcher was carrying a load of meat when he touched Sankara. Sankara exclaimed:
'What! You have touched me!' The butcher replied: 'Venerable sir, neither have you
touched me nor have I touched you. You are pure Ātman, unattached.' Jadabharata said
the same thing to King Rahugana.
"The Pure Ātman is unattached, and one cannot see It. If salt is mixed with water, one
cannot see the salt with the eyes.
"That which is the Pure Ātman is the Great Cause, the Cause of the cause. The gross,
the subtle, the causal, and the Great Cause. The five elements are gross. Mind, buddhi,
and ego are subtle. Prakriti, the Primal Energy, is the cause of all these. Brahman, Pure
Ātman, is the Cause of the cause.
This Pure Ātman alone is our real nature. What is jnāna? It is to know one's own Self and
keep the mind in It. It is to know the Pure Ātman.
"How long should a man perform his duties? As long as he identifies himself with the
body, in other words, as long as he thinks he is the body. That is what the Gitā says. To
think of the body as the Ātman is ajnāna, ignorance.
(To the bearded Brahmo devotee from Shibpur) "Are you a Brahmo?"
DEVOTEE: "Yes, sir."
MASTER (smiling): "I can recognize a worshipper of the Formless by looking at his face
and eyes. Please dive a little deeper. One doesn't get the gem by floating on the surface.
As for myself, I accept all-the formless God and God with form."
The Mārwāri devotees from Burrabazar entered the room and saluted the Master. He
began to praise them.
MASTER (to the devotees):"Ah! They are real devotees of God. They visit temples, sing
hymns to God, and eat prasad. And the gentleman whom they have made their priest
this year is learned in the Bhagavata."
MĀRWĀRI DEVOTEE: "Who is this 'I' that says, 'O Lord, I am Thy servant?' "
MASTER: "This is the lingasarira, or embodied soul. It consists of manas, buddhi, chitta,
and Ahamkāra."
DEVOTEE: "Who is the embodied soul?"
635MASTER: "It is the Ātman bound by the eight fetters. And what is the chitta? It is the 'I-
consciousness' that says, 'Aha!'"
What happens after death
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, what happens after death?"
MASTER: "According to the Gitā, one becomes afterwards what one thinks of at the time
of death. King Bharata thought of his deer and became a deer in his next life. Therefore
one must practise sādhanā in order to realize God. If a man thinks of God day and night,
he will have the same thought in the hour of death."
Māyā hides Knowledge
DEVOTEE: "Why don't we feel dispassion toward worldly objects?"
MASTER: "Because of māyā. Through māyā one feels the Real to be the unreal and the
unreal to be the Real. The Real means That which is eternal, the Supreme Brahman; and
the unreal means that which is non- eternal, that is to say, the world."
DEVOTEE: "We read the scriptures. Why is it that we can't assimilate them?"
MASTER: "What will one accomplish by mere reading? One needs spiritual practice-
austerity. Call on God. What is the use of merely repeating the word 'siddhi'? One must
eat a little of it.
'The hand bleeds when it touches a thorny plant. Suppose you bring such a plant and
repeat, sitting near it: 'There! The plant is burning.' Will that burn the plant? This world
is like the thorny plant. Light the fire of Knowledge and with it set the plant ablaze. Only
then will it be burnt up.
"One must labour a little while at the stage of sādhanā . Then the path becomes easy.
Steer the boat around the curves of the river and then let it go with the favourable wind.
"As long as you live inside the house of māyā, as long as there exists the cloud of

'woman and gold' and, thus standing apart, practises a little austerity and spiritual
discipline. Then only does the cloud of his ego and ignorance vanish. Then only does he
attain the Knowledge of God. This 'woman and gold' is the only cloud that hides the Sun
of Knowledge.
636Master's renunciation
(To the Mārwāri devotee) "The rules for a sannyāsi are extremely hard. He cannot have
the slightest contact with 'woman and gold'. He must not accept money with his own
hands, and he must not even allow it to be left near him.
"Lakshminarayan Mārwāri, a Vedantist, used to come here very often. One day he saw a
dirty sheet on my bed and said: 'I shall invest ten thousand rupees in your name. The
interest will enable you to pay your expenses.' The moment he uttered these words, I
fell unconscious, as if struck by a stick. Regaining consciousness I said to him: 'If you
utter such words again, you had better not come here. It is impossible for me to touch
money. It is also impossible for me to keep it near me.' He was a very clever fellow. He
said: 'Then you too have the idea of acceptance and rejection. In that case you haven't
attained Perfect Knowledge.' 'My dear sir, I said, 'I haven't yet gone that far.' (All laugh.)
Lakshminarayan then wanted to leave the money with Hriday. I said to him: 'That will
not do. If you leave it with Hriday, then I shall instruct him to spend it as I wish. If he
does not comply, I shall be angry. The very contact of money is bad. No, you can't leave
it with Hriday.' Won't an object kept near a mirror be reflected in it?"
Liberation
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, is a man liberated only when he dies on the bank of the
Ganges?"
MASTER: "It is the Knowledge of God alone that gives liberation. The Jnāni will certainly
attain liberation wherever he may die, whether in the charnel-pit or on the bank of the
,Ganges. But the bank of the Ganges is prescribed for a bound soul."
DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, why does a man dying in Benares become liberated?"
MASTER: "A person dying in Benares sees the vision of Śiva. Śiva says to him: 'This is
My aspect with form, My embodiment in māyā. I assume this form for the sake of the
devotees. Now look. I am merging in the indivisible Satchidananda!' Uttering these
words, Śiva withdraws His form and enables the dying person to see Brahman. "The
Puranas say that even a chandala endowed with love of God achieves liberation.
According to this school the name of God is enough to liberate a soul. There is no need
of such things as worship, sacrifice, the discipline of Tantra, and the recitation of
mantras.
Path of devotion for Kaliyuga
"But the teachings of the Vedas are different. According to the Vedas none but a
brahmin can be liberated. Further, the worship is not accepted by the gods unless the
mantras are recited correctly. One must perform sacrifice, worship, and so on, according
to scriptural injunction. But where is the time in the Kaliyuga to perform the Vedic
rituals? Therefore in the Kaliyuga the path of devotion prescribed by Nārada is best. The
path of karma is very difficult. Karma becomes a cause of bondage unless it is performed
in a spirit of detachment. Further, the life of man nowadays depends on food. He has no
time to observe the rituals enjoined by the scriptures. The patient dies if he tries to cure
637his fever by taking the decoction of herbs prescribed by the orthodox native physicians.
Therefore he should take a modern 'fever mixture'.
"According to Nārada the devotee should sing the name and glories of God. The path of
karma is not the right one for the Kaliyuga. Bhaktiyoga is the right path. Do your duties
in the world as long as you need them to reap the fruit of the actions of your past lives.
But you must develop love for God and be passionately attached to Him. The singing of
the name and glories of God destroys the effect of past action.
"You don't have to perform duties all your life. As you develop unalloyed love and
longing for God, your duties become fewer and fewer. After the realization of God they
completely drop away. When the young daughter-in-law is pregnant, her mother-in-law
lessens her duties. After the birth of the child she doesn't have to do any household
work."
Several young men from the village of Dakshineswar entered the room and saluted Sri
Ramakrishna. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. They sat down and began to
talk with the Master.
YOUNG MAN: "Sir, what is Knowledge?"
MASTER: "It is to know that God is the only Reality and that all else is unreal. That which
is the Real is also called Brahman. It has another name: Kala, Time. There is a saying,
'O brother, how many things come into being in Time and disappear in Time!'
"That whieh sports with Kala is called Kāli. She is the Primal Energy. Kala and Kāli,
Brahman and Śakti, are indivisible.
"That Brahman, of the nature of Reality, is eternal. It exists in past, present, and future.
It is without beginning or end. It cannot be described in words. The utmost that can be
said of Brahman is that It is of the very nature of Intelligence and Bliss.
"The world is illusory; Brahman alone is real. The world is of the nature of magic. The
magician is real but his magic is unreal"
Power of inborn tendencies
YOUNG MAN: "If the world is of the nature of illusion-magic-then why doesn't one get rid
of it?"
MASTER: "It is due to the samskaras, inborn tendencies. Repeated births in this world of
māyā make one believe that māyā is real.
"Let me tell you how powerful inborn tendencies are. A prince had, in a previous birth,
been the son of a washerman. While playing with his chums in his incarnation as the
prince, he said to them: 'Stop those games. I will show you a new one. I shall lie on my
belly, and you will beat the clothes on my back as the washerman does, making a
swishing sound.'
638"Many youngsters come here. But only a few long for God. These few are born with a
spiritual tendency. They shudder at the talk of marriage. Niranjan has said from boyhood
that he will not marry.
"More than twenty years ago two young men used to come here from Baranagore. One
was named Govinda Pal and the other Gopal Sen. They had been devoted to God since
boyhood. The very mention of marriage would frighten them. Gopal used to have bhava
samādhi. He would shrink from worldly people, as a mouse from a cat. One day he saw
the boys of the Tagore family strolling in the garden. He shut himself in the kuthi lest he
should have to talk with them.
"Gopal went into samādhi in the Panchavati. In that state he said to me, touching my
feet: 'Let me go. I cannot live in this world any more. You have a long time to wait. Let
me go.' I said to him, in an ecstatic mood, 'You must come again.' 'Very well, I will', he
said. A few days later Govinda came to me. 'Where is Gopal?' I asked him. He said, 'He
has passed away.'
"What are the other youngsters about? Money, house, carriage, clothes, and finally
marriage. These are the things that keep them busy. If they want to marry, at the outset
they make inquiries about the girl. They want to find out for themselves whether she is
beautiful.
"There is a person who speaks much ill of me. He is always criticizing me for loving the
youngsters. I love only those who are born with good tendencies, pure souls with longing
for God, who do not pay any attention to money, creature comforts, and such things.
"If married people develop love for God, they will not be attached to the world.
Hirananda is married. What if he is? He will not be much attached to the world."
Hirananda, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, was a native of Sindh. He had met the
Master in Calcutta and become devoted to him.
Manilal, the Mārwāri devotees, the Brahmo devotees from Shibpur, and the young men
from Dakshineswar saluted Sri Ramakrishna and took their leave.
It was evening. Lamps were lighted on the south and west verandahs. A lamp was
lighted in the Master's room also, and incense was burnt. He was repeating the name of
the Divine Mother, absorbed in contemplation of Her. After a while he talked again to the
devotees. There was still some time before the evening worship in the temples.
MASTER (to M.): "What need of the sandhya has a man who thinks of God day and
night?
What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any
more,
If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours?
Rituals may pursue him close, but never can they overtake him.
639Charity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan's
mind;
The Blissful Mother's Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and
sacrifice.
"The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om. A man is firmly established in
spiritual life when he goes into samādhi on uttering 'Om' only once.
"There is a sādhu in Hrishikesh who gets up early in the morning and stands near a great
waterfall. He looks at it the whole day and says to God: 'Ah, You have done well! Well
done! How amazing! He doesn't practise any other form of japa or austerity. At night he
returns to his hut.
"What need is there even to bother one's head about whether God is formless or has a
form? It is enough for a man to pray to Him, alone in solitude, weeping, 'O God, reveal
Yourself to me as You are.'
"God is both inside and outside. It is He who dwells inside us. Therefore the Vedas say,
'Tattvamasi-That thou art.' God is also outside us. He appears manifold through māyā;
but in reality He alone exists. Therefore before describing the various names and forms
of God, one should say, 'Om Tat Sat.'
"It is one thing to learn about God from the scriptures, and quite another to see Him.
The scriptures only give hints. Therefore to read a great many scriptures is not
necessary. It is much better to pray to God in solitude.
"It isn't necessary to read all of the Gitā. One can get the essence of the Gitā by
repeating the word ten times. It becomes reversed and is then 'tagi'. The essence of the
book is: 'O man, renounce everything and worship God.'"
The Master went into an ecstatic mood while watching the evening worship of Kāli in the
company of the devotees. He was in no condition even to salute the image. Very
carefully he returned to his room with the devotees and sat down; he was still in an
ecstatic mood. He spoke to them while in that state.
In the room was Hari, a young man about twenty years of age, who was a relative of the
Mukherjis and very much devoted to the Master. He was married. At that time he was
living with the Mukherjis and looking for a job.
MASTER (to Hari, in an ecstatic mood): "Take your initiation after getting your mother's
permission. (To Priya, referring to Hari) I couldn't give him the mantra though I said I
would initiate him. I don't initiate people. Continue with your own meditation and japa as
you have been doing."
PRIYA: "Yes, sir."
640MASTER: "And I am saying this to you in this state of my mind. Believe my words. You
see, there is no show or deceit here. I just said to the Divine Mother in my ecstatic
mood, 'O Mother, may those who come here [referring to himself] through sincere
attraction obtain perfection!' "
Mahendra Kaviraj of Sinthi was seated on the verandah conversing with Ramlal, Hazra,
and others. The Master called to him from his room. M. went out quickly and brought
Mahendra in.
MASTER (to Mahendra): "Sit down and listen to my words."
Mahendra was a little embarrassed. He sat down.
Various forms of divine love
MASTER (to the devotees): "God can be served in different ways. An ecstatic lover of
God enjoys Him in different ways. Sometimes he says, 'O God, You are the lotus and I
am the bee', and sometimes, 'You are the Ocean of Satchidananda and I am the fish.'
Sometimes, again, the lover of God says, 'I am Your dancing-girl.' He dances and sings
before Him. He thinks of himself sometimes as the friend of God and sometimes as His
handmaid. He looks on God sometimes as a child, as did Yaśoda, and sometimes as
husband or sweetheart, as did the gopis.
"Sometimes Balarama looked on Krishna as a friend; sometimes he would think he was
Krishna's umbrella or carpet. He served Krishna in all possible ways."
Was Sri Ramakrishna hinting at his own state of mind while thus describing the different
attitudes of a lover of God?
Chaitanya's spiritual moods
Next he described Chaitanya's three spiritual moods.
MASTER: "Chaitanyadeva used to experience three moods. In the inmost mood he would
be absorbed in samādhi, unconscious of the outer world. In the semi-conscious mood he
would dance in ecstasy but could not talk. In the conscious mood he would sing the
glories of God.
(To the devotees) "You are listening to my words. Try to assimilate them. When worldly
people sit before a sādhu, for the time being they completely hide all worldly thoughts
and ideas. But once away from the holy man they let them out again. You have seen a
pigeon eating dried peas. You think he has digested them, but he keeps them in his
crop. You can feel them there.
"At dusk put aside all duties and pray to God. One is reminded of Him by darkness. At
the approach of darkness one thinks: 'I could see everything a moment ago. Who has
brought about this change?' The Mussalmans put aside all activities and say their prayers
at the appointed times."
641Practice of japa
MUKHERJI: "Revered sir, is it good to practise japa?"
MASTER: "Yes. One attains God through japa. By repeating the name of God secretly
and in solitude one receives divine grace. Then comes His vision. Suppose there is a big
piece of timber lying under water and fastened to the land with a chain; by proceeding
along the chain, link by link, you will at last touch the timber.
"Higher than worship is japa, higher than japa is meditation, higher than meditation is
bhava, and higher than bhava are mahabhava and prema. Chaitanyadeva had prema,
When one attains prema one has the rope to tie God."
Hazra entered the room.
MASTER (to Hazra): "Love of God, when it is intense and spontaneous, is called raga-
bhakti. Vaidhi-bhakti, formal devotion, depends on scriptural injunctions. It comes and it
goes. But raga-bhakti is like a stone emblem of Śiva that has sprung up out of the
bowels of the earth. One cannot find its root; they say the root goes as far as Benares.
Only an Incarnation of God and His companions attain raga-bhakti."
HAZRA: "Ah me!"
MASTER: "One day I was returning from the Pine-grove, when I saw you telling your
beads. I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, what a small minded fellow he is! He lives
here and still he pratises japa with a rosary! Whoever comes he [referring to himself]
will have his spiritual consciousness awakened all a once; he won't have to bother much,
about japa. Go to Calcutta and you will find thousands telling their beads-even the
prostitutes.'
(To M.) "Please bring Naran here in a carriage. I am making the same request to
Mukherji. I shall give Naran something to eat when he comes. There is great significance
in feeding boys like him."
Saturday, October 4, 1884
It was the day of the first full moon after the Durga Puja. Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the
Calcutta house of Nabin Sen, the elder brother of Keshab Chandra Sen. On the previous
Thursday Keshab's mother had begged the Master to pay her a visit in Calcutta.
The Master seated himself in a room on the upper floor of the house. With him were
Baburam, Kishori, and a few other devotees. Nandalal and Keshab's other nephews,
Keshab's mother, and other relatives of his, waited on the Master. It had been arranged
to have devotional music performed in the room. M. was sitting in a room downstairs,
listening to the kirtan.
Master with Brahmo devotees
Sri Ramakrishna said to the Brahmo devotees: "The world is impermanent. One should
constantly remember death." Then he sang:
642Remember this, O mind! Nobody is your own:
Vain is your wandering in this world.
Trapped in the subtle snare of māyā as you are,
Do not forget the Mother's name. . . .
The Master said to the devotees: "Dive deep. What will you gain by merely floating on
the surface? Renounce everything for a few days, retire into solitude, and call on God
with all your soul"
The Master sang:
Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in. the Ocean of God's Beauty;
If you descend to the uttermost depths,
There you will find the gem of Love. . . .
At Sri Ramakrishna's request the Brahmo devotees sang:
Thou art my All in All, O Lord!- the Life of my life, the Essence
of essence;
In the three worlds I have none else but Thee to call my own.
Thou art my peace, my joy, my hope;
Thou my support, my wealth, my glory;
Thou my wisdom and my strength. . . .
The Master sang again:
O Mother, for Yaśoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called
Thee her precious "Blue Jewel":
Where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, O terrible Syama? . .
.
The Brahmo devotees also sang to theaccompaniment of cymbals and drums:
O Mother, how deep is Thy love for men!
Mindful of it, I weep for joy.
Almost from the day of my birth
I have transgressed Thine every law,
And still Thou lookest on me with love,
Comforting me with sweetest words.
Mindful of it, I weep for joy.
O Mother, the burden of Thy love
Is far too great for me to bear;
My soul gives a heart-piercing cry
At Thy love's touch. To Thee I come,
Seeking a refuge at Thy feet.
643They again sang of the Divine Mother:
O Mother, Thou my Inner Guide, ever awake within my heart!
Day and night Thou holdest me in Thy lap.
Why dost Thou show such tenderness to this unworthy child of
Thine'?
Ah! It seems Thou art mad with love: now caressing, now with
strong grasp
Holding me firm, Thou givest me to drink
Thy nectar, pouring in my ears Thy words of loving
tenderness.
Unceasing is Thy love for me, a love that cannot see my faults ;
Whenever I am in danger, Thou dost save me.
Saviour of sinners! I know the truth: I am my Mother's and She
is mine.
Now I shall listen to Her alone, and follow the path of
righteousness;
Drinking the milk that flows from my Mother's breasts,
I shall be strong and sing with joy: "Hail, O Mother! Brahman
Eternal!"
The Master and the Brahmo devotees sang several songs about Hari and Gaurānga.
Sunday, October 5, 1884
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room after the midday meal, with M., Hazra, the elder
Kāli, Baburam, Ramlal, Hari, and others. Some of them sat on the floor and some stood
about. On the previous day the Master had visited Keshab's mother at her Calcutta
house and had made her happy with his devotional songs.
Hazra's eccentricities
Hazra had been living with the Master at Dakshineswar a long time. He was a little
conceited about his knowledge and even criticized the Master now and then before
others. Again, he would sit on the verandah of the Master's room and tell his beads with
apparent concentration. He spoke slightingly of Chaitanya as a "modern Incarnation". He
would say: "God gives not only pure devotion but also wealth. He has no lack of it. By
attaining God one obtains the eight occult powers as well." Hazra had a small debt to
clear up, about one thousand rupees. He had incurred it for the building of his house and
was worried about paying it.
The elder Kāli had a position in an office, from which he received a small salary. He had
a large family to maintain. He was devoted to the Master and visited him now and then,
even absenting himself from the office.
644KALl (to Hazra): "You go about criticizing people; you are like a touchstone, testing what
is pure gold and what is impure. Why do you speak so much ill of others?" HAZRA:
"Whatever I say, I say to him [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] alone."
MASTER: "That is so."
Hazra began to explain Tattvajnana.
HAZRA: "The meaning of Tattvajnana is the knowledge of the existence of the twenty-
four tattvas, or cosmic principles."
He was wrong about the meaning of the word.
A DEVOTEE: "What are they?"
HAZRA: "The five elements, the six passions, the five organs of perception, the five
organs of action, and so forth."
M. (to the Master, smiling): "He says that the six passions are included in the twenty-
four cosmic principles."
MASTER (smiling): "Listen to him! Notice how he explains Tattvajnana! The word really
means 'knowledge of Self'. The word 'Tat' means the Supreme Self, and the word 'tvam',
the embodied soul. One attains Supreme Knowledge, Tattvajnana, by realizing the
identity of the embodied soul and the Supreme Self."
After a few minutes Hazra left the room and sat on the porch.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "He [meaning Hazra] only argues. This moment perhaps
he understands, but the next moment he is his old self again.
"When the angler hooks a big fish and finds it pulling hard, he releases the line;
otherwise it will snap and the angler himself will be thrown into the water. Therefore I do
not say much to him.
(To M.) "Hazra said that a man could not be liberated unless he was born in a brahmin
body. 'How is that?' I said. 'One attains liberation through bhakti alone. Savari was the
daughter of a hunter. She, Ruhidas, and others belonged to the sudra caste. They were
liberated through bhakti alone.' 'But still-Hazra insisted.
"He recognized Dhruva's spiritual greatness, but not as much as he recognized
Prahlada's. When Lātu said, 'Dhruva had great yearning for God from his boyhood', he
kept still.
"I said that there was nothing greater than the bhakti that sought no end and had no
selfish motive. Hazra contradicted me. I said to him, 'A wealthy man is annoyed when a
petitioner comes to him. "There he comes", he says angrily. "Sit down", he says to him
645in an indifferent voice, and shows that he is much annoyed. He doesn't allow such a
beggar to ride with him in his carriage.'
"But Hazra said that God was not like such wealthy people of the world; did He lack
wealth, that He should feel pinched to give it away? Hazra said further: 'When rain falls
from the sky, the Ganges and all the big rivers and lakes overflow with water. Small
tanks, too, are filled. Likewise, God out of His grace grants wealth and riches as well as
knowledge and devotion.'
(To the devotees) "But I call this impure devotion to God. Pure devotion has no desire
behind it. You don't want anything from me, but you love to see me and hear my words.
My mind also dwells on you. I wonder how you are and why you don't come.
"You don't want anything of God but still you love Him. That is pure bhakti, love of God
with no motive behind it. Prahlada had it. He sought neither kingdom nor riches; he
sought Hari alone."
M: "Hazra is a chatterbox. He won't achieve anything unless he becomes silent."
MASTER: "Now and then he comes to me and becomes mellowed. But he is a pest; again
he argues. It is very hard to get rid of egotism. You may cut down an Aśwattha tree, but
the next day a sprout will spring up. As long as the roots remain, the tree will grow
again.
"I said to Hazra, 'Don't speak ill of anyone.' It is Narayana Himself who has assumed all
these forms. One can worship even a wicked person. Haven't you observed the Kumari
Puja? Why should you worship a girl who has all the physical limitations of a human
being? It is because she is a form of the Divine Mother. But God dwells in a special way
in His devotee. The devotee is His parlour. If the gourd has a large body then it makes a
good Tānpura. It gives a nice sound."
Two monks had arrived at the temple garden in the morning. They were devoted to the
study of the Bhagavad Gitā, the Vedānta, and other scriptures. They entered the
Master's room, saluted him, and sat on the mat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna was
seated on the small couch. The Master spoke to the sādhus in Hindusthani.
MASTER: "Have you had your meal?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "What did you eat?"
SĀDHU: "Dal and bread. Will you take some?"
MASTER: "No, I take only a few morsels of rice. Well, your japa and meditation must be
without any desire for results. Isn't that so?"
646SĀDHU: "Yes, Sir."
MASTER: "That is good. One must surrender the result to God. What do you say? That is
the view of the Gitā."
One sādhu said to the other, quoting from the Gitā: "O Arjuna, whatever action you
perform, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give in charity,
and whatever austerities you practise, offer everything to Me."
MASTER: "If you give God something, you receive it back a thousand times over. That is
why after doing meritorious deeds one offers a handful of water to God. It is the symbol
of offering the fruit to God. When Yudhisthira was about to offer all his sins to Krishna,
Bhima warned him: 'Never do such a thing. Whatever you offer to Krishna you will
receive back a thousandfold.'
(To one of the sādhus) "Well, sir, one should be de- sireless; one should renounce all
desires. Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "But I have the desire for bhakti. That is not bad. Rather, it is good. Sweets
are bad, for they produce acidity. But sugar candy is an exception. Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Well, sir, what do you think of the Vedānta?"
SĀDHU: "It includes all the six systems of philosophy."
MASTER: "But the essence of Vedānta is: 'Brahman alone is real, and the world illusory;
I have no separate existence; I am that Brahman alone.' Isn't that so?"
SĀDHU: "That is true, sir."
MASTER: "But for those who lead a householder's life, and those who identify themselves
with the body, this attitude of 'I am He' is not good. It is not good for householders to
read Vedānta or the Yoga-vāsishta. It is very harmful for them to read these books.
Householders should look on God as their Master and on themselves as His servants.
They should think, 'O God, You are the Master and the Lord, and I am Your servant.'
People who identify themselves with the body should not have the attitude of 'I am He'."
The devotees in the room remained silent. Sri Ramakrishna was smiling a little, a picture
of self-contentment. He appeared happy in his own Self.
One of the sādhus whispered in the other's ear: "Look! This is the state of the
paramahamsa."
647MASTER (to M.): "I feel like laughing."
Sri Ramakrishna smiled like a child. The monks left the room. The devotees were moving
about in the room and on the porch.
Master ( to M.) :"Did you go to Nabin Sen's house?"
M:"Yes, sir. I listened to the songs from down stairs."
MASTER: "That was well done. Your wife was there. She is a cousin of Keshab Sen, isn't
she?"
M: "A distant cousin."
Sri Ramakrishna strolled up and down with M. No one else was with them.
MASTER: "A man visits his father-in-law's house. I, too, often used to think that I should
marry, go to my father-in-law's house, and have great fun. But see what has come of
it!"
M: "Sir, you say, 'If the boy holds his father's hand, he may slip; but he doesn't if the
father holds his hand.' That is exactly your condition. The Mother has taken hold of your
hand."
MASTER: "I met Bamandas at the Viswases' house. I said to him, 'I have come to see
you.' As I was leaving the place I heard him say: 'Goodness gracious! The Divine Mother
has caught hold of him, like a tiger seizing a man.' At that time I was a young man, very
stout, and always in ecstasy.
Master's attitude toward women
"I am very much afraid of women. When I look at one I feel as if a tigress were coming
to devour me. Besides, I find that their bodies, their limbs, and even their pores are very
large. This makes me look upon them as she-monsters. I used to be much more afraid
of women than I am at present. I wouldn't allow one to come near me. Now I persuade
my mind in various ways to look upon women as forms of the Blissful Mother.
"A woman is, no doubt, a part of the Divine Mother. But as far as a man is concerned,
especially a sannyāsi or a devotee of God, she is to be shunned. I don't allow a woman
to sit near me very long, no matter how great her devotion may be. After a little while I
say to her, 'Go and see the temples.'
If that doesn't make her move, I myself leave the room on the pretext of smoking.
"I find that some men are not at all interested in women. Niranjan says, 'A woman never
enters my thought.' I asked Hari about it. He too says that his mind does not dwell on
woman.
648"Woman monopolizes three quarters of the mind, which should be given to God. And
then, after the birth of a child, almost the whole mind is frittered away on the family.
Then what is left to give to God?
"Again, there are some men who shed their last drop of blood, as it were, to keep their
wives out of mischief. There is the gate-keeper, an old man, whose wife is only fourteen
years old. She had to live with him. They lived in a thatched hut with walls made of dry
leaves. People made holes in the wall to peep in. Now she has left him and run away.
"I know another man. He doesn't know where to keep his wife. There was some trouble
at home, and now he is greatly worried. Let's not talk about these things any more.
"If a man lives with a woman, he cannot help coming under her control. Worldly men get
up and sit down at the bidding of women. They all speak highly of their wives.
"Once I wanted to go to a certain place. I asked Ramlal's aunt about it. She forbade me
to go; so I could not. A little while later I said to myself: 'I am not a householder. I have
renounced "woman and gold". If, in spite of that, this is my plight, one can well imagine
how much worldly people are controlled by their wives.'"
M: "One who lives in the midst of 'woman and gold' can't help being stained by it, even if
only slightly. You told us about Jaynarayan. He was such a great scholar. When you
visited him he was an old man. You found him warming pillows and blankets in the sun."
MASTER: "But he had no vanity of scholarship. Further, what he said about the last days
of his life came to pass. He spent them in Benares, following the injunctions of the
scriptures. I saw his children. They were wearing high boots and had been educated in
English schools."
By means of questions and answers Sri Ramakrishna now explained to M. his own
exalted state.
MASTER: "At first I went stark mad. Why am I less so now? But I get into that state now
and then."
M: "You don't have just one mood. As you said, you experience various moods.
Sometimes you are like a child, sometimes like a madman, sometimes like an inert
thing, and sometimes like a ghoul. And now and then you are a natural person."
MASTER: "Yes, like a child. But I also experience the moods of a boy and a young man.
When I give instruction I feel like a young man. Then there is my boyishness: like a boy
twelve or thirteen years old, I want to be frivolous. That is why I joke and make merry
with the youngsters.
"What do you think of Naran?"
M: "He has good traits, sir."
649MASTER: "Yes, the shell of the gourd is good. The Tānpura made out of it will give good
music. He says to me, 'You are everything.' Everyone speaks of me according to his
comprehension. Some say that I am simply a sādhu, a devotee of God.
"If I forbid Naran to do something, he understands it very well. The other day I asked
him to pull up the curtain, but he didn't do it. I had forbidden him to tie a knot, to sew
his clothes, to lock a box, to pull up a curtain, and similar things. He understood it all.
He who would renounce the world must practise all these disciplines. They are meant for
sannyāsis.
"While practising sādhanā a man should regard a woman as a raging forest fire or a black
cobra. But in the state of perfection, after the realization of God, she appears as the
Blissful Mother. Then you will look on her as a form of the Divine Mother."
A few days earlier Sri Ramakrishna had spoken many words of warning to Narayan about
women. He had said: "Don't let yourself touch the air near a woman's body. Cover
yourself with a heavy sheet lest the air should touch your body. And keep yourself eight
cubits, two cubits, or at least one cubit away from all women except your mother."
MASTER (to M.): "Naran's mother said to him about me, 'Even we are enchanted by the
sight of him, not to speak of you, a mere child.' None but the guileless can realize God.
How guileless Niranjan is!"
M: "True, sir."
MASTER: "Didn't you notice him that day in the carriage on the way to Calcutta? He is
always the same-without guile. A man shows one side of his nature inside his house and
another to the outside world. Since his father's death Narendra has been worried about
his worldly affairs. He has a slightly calculating mind. How I wish that other youngsters
were like Niranjan and Narendra!
"Today I went to the village to see Nilkantha's theatrical performance. It was given at
Nabin Niyogi's house. The children there are very bad; they have nothing to do but find
fault. In such a place a person's spiritual feeling is restrained. During a performance the
other day I saw Doctor Madhu shedding tears. I looked at him alone.
(To M.) "Can you tell me why people feel so much attracted to this place [meaning
himself]? What does it mean?"
M: "It reminds me of an episode in Krishna's life at Vrindāvan. Krishna transformed
Himself into the cowherd boys and the calves, whereupon the cows began to feel more
strongly attracted to the cowherd boys, the gopis, and the calves."
MASTER: "That is the attraction of God. The truth is, the Divine Mother creates the spell
and it is that which attracts people.
650"Well, not as many people come here as used to go to Keshab Sen. And how many
people respect and honour Keshab! He is known even in England. Queen Victoria spoke
with him. It is said in the Gitā that God's power is manifest in him who is honoured and
respected by many. But so many people do not come here."
M: "It was the householders who went to Keshab Sen."
MASTER: "Yes, that is true. The worldly-minded."
M: "Will what Keshab has founded remain a long time?"
MASTER: "Why, he has written a samhita, a book of rules for the guidance of the
members of his Brahmo Samaj."
M: "But it is quite different with the work done by a Divine Incarnation Himself-
Chaitanya's work, for instance."
MASTER: "Yes, yes. That is true."
M: "You yourself tell us that Chaitanyadeva said, 'The seeds I have sown will certainly
bear fruit some time or other.' A man left some seeds on the cornice of a house. Later on
the house fell down and trees grew from those seeds."
MASTER: "Many people go to the Samaj founded by Shivanath and friends. Isn't that
so?"
M: "Yes, sir. People of that sort."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, yes. The worldly-minded go there, but not many of those who
long for God and are trying to renounce 'woman and gold'."
M: "It will be fine if a current flows from this place. Everything will be carried away by its
force. Nothing that comes out of this place will be monotonous."
MASTER (smiling): "I keep men's own ideals intact. I ask a Vaishnava to hold to his
Vaishnava attitude and a Sakta to his. But this also I say to them 'Never feel that your
path alone is right and that the paths of others a wrong and full of errors. Hindus,
Mussalmans, and Christians are going to the same destination by different paths. A man
can realize God by following his own path if his prayer is sincere.
"Vijay's mother-in-law said to me, 'Why don't you tell Balarām that it unnecessary to
worship God with form; that it will be enough if he prays to the formless Satchidananda?'
I replied, 'Why should I say such a thing, and why should he listen to me even if I should
say it?' "
651M: "That is true, sir. There are different paths to suit time, place, and the fitness of the
candidate. Whatever path a man may follow, he will ultimately reach God if he is pure of
heart and has sincere longing. That is what you say."
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room. Hari, the relative of the Mukherjis, M., and
other devotees were on the floor. An unknown person saluted the Master and took a
seat. The Master remarked later that his eyes were not good. They were yellow, like a
cat's.
Hari prepared a smoke for Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER (to Hari): "Let me see the palm of your hand. This mark is good sign. Relax
your hand."
He took Hari's hand into his as if to feel its weight.
MASTER: "He is still childlike. As yet there is no blemish in him. (To the devotees) From
the hand I can tell whether a person is deceitful or guileless. (To Hari) Why, you should
go to your father-in-law's house. You should talk to your wife and have a little fun with
her if you like. (To M.) What do you say?" (M. and the others laugh.)
M: "If a new pot becomes bad, one can no longer keep milk in it."
MASTER (smiling): "How do you know that it is not already bad?"
The two Mukherjis, Mahendra and Priyanath, were brothers. They did not work in an
office, but had their own flour-mill. Priyanath had been an engineer. Sri Ramakrishna
talked to Hari about the Mukherji brothers.
MASTER: "The elder brother is nice, isn't he? He is artless."
HARI: "Yes, sir."
MASTER: "Isn't the younger brother very miserly? I understand that since coming here
he has improved a great deal. He once said to me, 'I didn't know anything before.' (To
Hari) Do they give anything in charity?"
HARI: "Not much, as far as I can see. Their elder brother, now dead, was a very good
man. He was very charitable."
Physical signs indicating character
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Whether a person will make spiritual progress or not
can be known to a great extent by his physical marks. The hand of a deceitful person is
heavy. A snub nose is not a good sign. Sambhu had that kind of nose; hence he was not
quite sincere in spite of all his wisdom. Pigeon-breast is not a good sign either. Hard
bones and heavy elbow-joints are bad signs too; and yellow eyes, like a cat's.
652"A man becomes very mean if he has lips that are thick, like a dome's. A brahmin was
here for a few months acting as priest of the Vishnu temple. I couldn't eat the food he
touched. One day I suddenly exclaimed, 'He is a dome!' Afterwards he said to me: 'Yes,
sir. We live in the dome quarters. I know how to make wicker baskets and such things,
Just like a dome.'
"There are other bad physical signs: one eye and squint eyes. It is rather better to have
one eye, but never squint eyes. Squint-eyed people are wicked and deceitful.

"A student of Mahesh Nyayaratna's came here. He described himself as an atheist. He said to Hriday: 'I am an atheist. You may take up the position of a believer in God and argue with me.'

I noticed that his eyes were yellow, like a cat's.

"Whether a person is good or bad can also be known from the way he walks."

Sri Ramakrishna paced the verandah. M. and Baburam walked with him.

MASTER (to Hazra): "A man came here. I saw that his eyes were like a cat's. He asked
me: 'Do you know astrology? I am in some difficulty.' I said: 'No, I don't. Go to
Baranagore. There you will find astrologers.'"

## Master and Nilkantha

Baburam and M. talked about Nilkantha's theatrical performance. Baburam had spent the previous night at the temple garden after his return from Nabin Sen's house. In the morning he had attended Nilkantha's performance with the Master.

MASTER (to M. and Baburam): "What are you talking about?"

M. AND BABURAM: "About Nilkantha's performance."

While pacing the verandah Sri Ramakrishna suddenly took M. aside and said, "The less
people know about your thoughts of God, the better for You," Saying these words the
Master abruptly went away. A short time afterwards he began to talk with Hazra.
HAZRA: "Nilkantha told you he would pay you a visit. It would be good send for him."
MASTER: "No, he didn't sleep at all last night. It will be different if he comes here
through the will of God."
Sri Ramakrishna asked Baburam to visit Narayan at his house. He looked on Narayan as
God Himself, and so he longed to see him. The Master said to Baburam, "You may go to
him with one of your English text-books."
About three o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room. Nilkantha
arrived with five or six of his companions. The Master went toward the east door as if to
653welcome him. The musicians bowed before the Master, touching the ground with their
foreheads.
Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. Baburam stood behind him. M., Nilkantha, and the
musicians were in front of him, watching him in great amazement. Dinanath, an officer
of the temple, looked on from the north side of the bed. Soon the room was filled with
officers of the temple garden. Sri Ramakrishna's ecstasy abated a little. He seated
himself on a mat on the floor, surrounded by Nilkantha and other devotees.
MASTER (still in an ecstatic mood): "I am all right."
NILKANTHA (with folded hands): "Make me all right too."
MASTER (smiling): "Why, you are already all right. Adding the letter to 'a', one gets 'ka'.
By adding another 'a' to 'ka', one still gets the same 'ka'." (All laugh.)
NILKANTHA: "Revered sir, I am entangled in worldliness."
MASTER (smiling): "God has kept you in the world for the sake of others. There are eight
fetters. One cannot get rid of them all. God keeps one or two so that a man may live in
the world and teach others. You have organized this theatrical company. How many
people are being benefited by seeing your bhakti! If you give up everything, then where
will these musicians go?
"God is now doing all these works through you. When they are finish, you will not return
to them. The housewife finishes her household duties feeds everyone, including the
menservants and maidservants, and then goes to take her bath. She doesn't come back
then even if people shout for her."
NILKANTHA: "Please bless me."
MASTER: "Yaśoda went mad with grief because she was separated from Krishna. She
went to Radhika, who was meditating. Radhika said to her an ecstatic state: 'I am the
Ultimate Prakriti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me.' Yaśoda said to her: 'What shall I
ask of You? Please bless me, that with all my body, mind, and speech I may think of God
and serve Him; that with my ears I may hear the singing of God's name and glories; that
with my hands I may serve Hari and His devotees; that with my eyes I may behold His
form and His devotees.'
"Your eyes fill with tears when you utter the name of God. Why then should you worry
about anything? Divine love has grown in you.
"To know many things is ajnāna, ignorance. To know only one thing is jnāna,
Knowledge-the realization that God alone is real and that He dwells in all. And to talk to
Him is vijnāna, a fuller Knowledge. To love God in different ways, after realizing Him, is
vijnāna.
654"It is also said that God is beyond one and two. He is beyond speech and mind. To go up
from the Lila to the Nitya and come down again from the Nitya to the Lila is mature
bhakti.
"I love that song of yours about aspiring to reach the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother. It
is enough to know that everything depends on the grace of God. But one must pray to
God; it will not do to remain inactive. The lawyer gives all the arguments and finishes his
pleading by saying to the judge: 'I have said all I have to say. Now the decision rests
with Your Honour.' "
After a few minutes Sri Ramakrishna said to Nilkantha: "You sang so much in the
morning, and now you have taken the trouble to come here. But here everything is
'honorary'."

NILKANTHA: "Why so?"
MASTER (smiling): "I know what you will say."
NILKANTHA: "I shall get a precious gem from here."
MASTER: "You already have that precious gem. What will you gain by adding again the
letter 'a' to 'ka'? If you didn't have the gem, should I like your songs so much?
Ramprasad had attained divine realization; that is why his songs appeal so much.
"I had already planned to hear your music. Later on Niyogi, too, came here to invite
me."
The Master was sitting on the small couch. He told Nilkantha that he would like to hear a
song or two about the Divine Mother.
Nilkantha sang two songs with his companions. When the Master heard the second song
he stood up and went into samādhi. Presently he began to dance in an ecstasy of divine
love. Nilkantha and the devotees sang and danced around him. Then Nilkantha sang a
song about Śiva, and the Master danced with the devotees.
When the singing was over, Sri Ramakrishna said to Nilkantha, "I should like to hear that
song of yours I heard in Calcutta."
M: "About Sri Gaurānga?"
MASTER: "Yes, yes!"
Nilkantha sang the song, "The beautiful Gaurānga, the youthful dancer, fair as molten
gold."
655Sri Ramakrishna sang again and again the line, "Everything is swept away by the onrush
of love", and danced with Nilkantha and the other devotees. Those who saw that
indescribable dancing were never to forget it. The room was filled with people, all
intoxicated with divine joy. It seemed as if Chaitanya himself were dancing with his
companions.
Manomohan was in an ecstatic mood. He was a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna and a
brother-in-law of Rākhāl. Several ladies of his family had come with him. They were
witnessing this divine music and dancing from the north verandah.
Sri Ramakrishna sang again, this time about Gaurānga and Nityananda:
Behold, the two brothers have came, who weep while chanting Hari's name. . . .
He danced with Nilkantha and the other devotees, improvising the line:
Behold, the two brothers have come, they who are mad with love of Radha.
Hearing the loud music, many people gathered about the room. The verandahs to the
south and north, and the semicircular porch to the west of the room, were crowded with
people. Even passengers in the boats going along the Gauges were attracted by the
kirtan.
The music was over Sri Ramakrishna bowed to the Divine Mother and said, "Bhagavata-
Bhakta-Bhagavan. My salutations to the jnanis, my salutations to the yogis, my
salutations to the bhaktas."
The Master was seated on the semicircular porch with Nilkantha and the other devotees.
The autumn moon flooded all the quarters with light. Sri Ramakrishna and Nilkantha
talked.
NILKANTHA: "You are none other than Gaurānga."
MASTER: "Why should you say such a thing? I am the servant of .the servant of all. The
waves belong to the Ganges; but does the Ganges belong to the waves?"
NILKANTHA: "You may say whatever you like, but we regard you as Gaurānga himself."
MASTER (tenderly, in an ecstatic mood): "My dear sir, I try to seek my 'I', but I do not
find it. Hanuman said: 'O Rāma, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a
part, and sometimes that You are the Master and I am Your servant. But when I have
the Knowledge of Reality, I see that You are I and I am You.'"
NILKANTHA: "What shall I say, sir? Please be gracious to us."
656MASTER (smiling): "You are ferrying many people across the ocean or the world. How
many hearts are illumined by hearing your music!"
NILKANTHA: "You talk of ferrying. But bless me that I may not be drowned in the ocean
myself."
MASTER (smiling): "If you get drowned, it will be in the Sea of Immortality."
Sri Ramakrishna was delighted with Nilkantha's company. He said to the musician: "For
you to have come here! You whom people see as a result of many austerities and
prayers! Listen to a song."
The Master sang a song, two lines of which ran:
When the Blissful Mother comes to my house, how much of the
Chandi I shall hear!
How many monks will come here, and how many yogis with
matted locks!
He said, continuing, "As long as the Divine Mother has come here, many yogis with
matted locks will come too."
Sri Ramakrishna laughed. To M., Baburam, and the other devotees he said: "I feel very
much like laughing. Just fancy, I am singing for these musicians!"
NILKANTHA: "We go about singing; but today we have had our true reward."
MASTER (smiling): 'when a shopkeeper sells an article, he sometimes gives a little extra
something to the buyer. You sang at Nabin's house and have given the extra something
here."
All laughed.
