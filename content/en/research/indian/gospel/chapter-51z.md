Bhavanāth had married and was trying to find a job; so he could not visit Sri Ramakrishna frequently at Cossipore. He had said to M.: "I understand that Vidyāsāgar
wants to start a new school. I have to earn my livelihood. 

Will it be possible for me to secure a job in that school?" The Master was much worried about Bhavanāth's being
entangled in worldly life. 

Bhavanāth was twenty-three or twenty four years old.

MASTER (to Narendra): "Give him a lot of courage."

Narendra and Bhavanāth smiled. Sri Ramakrishna said to Bhavanāth, by signs: "Be a great hero. Don't forget yourself when you see her weeping behind her veil. Oh, women
cry so mucheven when they blow their noses! (Narendra, Bhavanāth, and M. laugh.)

"Keep your mind firm on God. He who is a hero lives with a woman but does not indulge in physical pleasures. Talk to your wife only about God."
A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna said to Bhavanāth, by a sign, "Take your meal here today."

BHAVANĀTH: "Yes, sir. I am quite all right. Don't worry about me." Surendra came in and took a seat. The devotees offered garlands of flowers to the
Master every evening. Sri Ramakrishna put these garlands around his neck. 

Surendra sat quietly in the room. Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy mood and gave him two garlands. 

Surendra saluted the Master and put them around his neck.

All sat in silence and looked at Sri Ramakrishna. Surendra saluted the Master again and stood up. He was about to leave. He asked Bhavanāth to hang the straw screens over
the windows. 


## Hirananda

Hirananda came in with two of his friends. He was a native of Sindh, about twenty-two
hundred miles from Calcutta. After finishing his college education in Calcutta in 1883, he
had returned to Sindh and taken charge of editing two papers, the Sindh Times and the
Sindh Sudhar. While studying in Calcutta he had often visited Keshab Chandra Sen andhad come to know him intimately. He had met Sri Ramakrishna at the Kāli temple at
Dakshineswar and had spent an occasional night there with the Master. Hearing of Sri
Ramakrishna's illness, he now came to Calcutta from Sindh to see him. The Master
himself had been very eager to see Hirananda.
Sri Ramakrishna pointed to Hirananda and said to M., by signs: "A very fine boy. Do you
know him?"
M: "Yes, sir."
MASTER (to Hirananda and M.): "Please talk a little. I want to hear you both."
When M. remained silent, Sri Ramakrishna asked him: "Is Narendra here? Call him."
Narendra entered the room and sat near the Master.
MASTER (to Narendra and Hirananda): "I want to hear you two talk."
Hirananda was silent a few moments and then after great hesitation began the
conversation.
Narendra argues with Hirananda
HIRANANDA (to Narendra): "Why does a devotee of God suffer?" His words were sweet
as nectar. Everyone in the room could feel that his heart was filled with love.
NARENDRA: "The plan of the universe is devilish. I could have created a better world."
HIRANANDA: "Can one feel happiness without misery?"
NARENDRA: "I am not making a plan for a universe, but simply giving my opinion of the
present plan.
"But all these problems are solved if we have faith only in one thing, and that is
Pantheism. All doubts disappear if one believes that everything is God. God alone is
responsible for all that happens."
HIRANANDA: "Very easy to say that."
Narendra sang Sankara's Six Stanzas on Nirvāna:
Om I am neither mind, intelligence, ego, nor chitta,
Neither ears nor tongue nor the senses of smell and
sight;
Nor am I ether, earth, fire, water, or air:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!I am neither the Prāna nor the five vital breaths,
Neither the seven elements of the body nor its five
sheaths,
Nor hands nor feet nor tongue, nor the organs of sex
and voiding:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Neither loathing nor liking have I, neither greed nor
delusion;
No sense have I of ego or pride, neither dharma nor
moksha;
Neither desire of the mind nor object for its desiring:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Neither right nor wrongdoing am I, neither pleasure nor
pain,
Nor the mantra, the sacred place, the Vedas, the
sacrifice;
Neither the act of eating, the eater, nor the food:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
Death or fear I have none, nor any distinction of caste;
Neither father nor mother nor even a birth have I;
Neither friend nor comrade, neither disciple nor guru:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
I have no form or fancy; the All-pervading am I;
Everywhere I exist, yet I am beyond the senses;
Neither salvation am I, nor anything that may be
known:
I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am Śiva! I am Śiva!
HIRANANDA: "Good!"
SRI RAMAKRISHNA (to Hirananda, by a sign): "Give him an answer."
HIRANANDA: "It is all the same, whether you look at a room from a corner or look at it
from the middle. It is the same God-Consciousness that one feels, whether one says, 'O
God, I am Thy servant', or, 'I am He.' One may enter a room by several doors."
Narendra's spirit of renunciation
All sat in silence. Hirananda said to Narendra, "Please sing some more."
Narendra sang the Five Stanzas on the Kaupina:Roaming ever in the grove of Vedānta,
Ever pleased with his beggar's morsel,
Ever walking with heart free from sorrow,
Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.
Sitting at the foot of a tree for shelter,
Using the palms of his hands for eating,
Wrapped in a garment fine or ugly,
Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.
Satisfied fully by the Bliss within him,
Curbing wholly the cravings of his senses,
Contemplating day and night the Absolute Brahman,
Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.
When Sri Ramakrishna heard the line,
Brahman", he
"Contemplating day and night the Absolute
said in a very low voice, "Ah!" Then, by a sign, he said to the devotees,
"This is the characteristic of the yogi."
Narendra finished the hymn:
Witnessing the changes of mind and body,
Naught but the self within him beholding,
Thinking not of outer, of inner, or of middle,
Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.
Chanting "Brahman", the Word of redemption,
Meditating only on "I am Brahman",
Living on alms and wandering freely,
Blest indeed is the wearer of the loin-cloth.
Again Narendra sang:
Meditate on Him, the Perfect, the Embodiment of Bliss;
Meditate on Him, the Formless, the Root of the
Universe,
The Hearer behind the ear, the Thinker behind the
mind,
The Speaker behind the tongue, Himself beyond all
words:
He is the Life of life, the Ultimate, the Adorable!
MASTER (to Narendra): "And that one
'All that exists art Thou.' "
Narendra sang:
I have joined my heart to Thee: all that exists art Thou;
Thee only have I found, for Thou art, all that exists.O Lord, Beloved of my heart! Thou art the Home of all;
Where indeed is the heart in which Thou dost not dwell?
Thou hast entered every heart: all that exists art Thou.
Whether sage or fool, whether Hindu or Mussulman,
Thou makest them as Thou wilt: all that exists art Thou.
Thy presence is everywhere, whether in heaven or in
Kaaba;
Before Thee all must bow, for Thou art all that exists.
From earth below to the highest heaven, from heaven to
deepest earth,
I see Thee wherever I look: all that exists art Thou.
Pondering, I have understood; I have seen it beyond a
doubt;
I find not a single thing that may be compared to Thee.
To Jafar it has been revealed that Thou art all that
exists.
As the Master listened, to the line,
"Thou hast entered every heart", he said by a sign:
"God dwells in everybody's heart. He is the Inner Guide."
As Narendra sang the line,
Thou", Hirananda
"I see Thee wherever I look: all that exists art
said to him: "Yes, 'All that exists art Thou.' Now you say: 'Thou!
Thou! Not I, but Thou!'"
NARENDRA: Give me a one and I'll give you a million. Thou art I; I am Thou. Nothing
exists but I "
Narendra recited a few verses from the Ashtāvakra Samhitā. The room again became
silent.
MASTER (to Hirananda, pointing to Narendra): "He seems to be walking with an
unsheathed sword in his hand. (To M., pointing to Hirananda) How quiet! Like a cobra,
quiet before the charmer, with its hood spread."
Sri Ramakrishna fell into an inward mood. Hirananda and M. were seated near him.
There was complete silence in the room. The Master's body was being racked with
indescribable pain. The devotees could not bear the sight of this illness; but somehow
the Master made them forget his suffering. He sat there, his face beaming as if there
were no trace of illness in his throat. The devotees had placed flowers and garlands
before him as their loving offerings. He picked up a flower and touched with it first his
head, then his throat, heart, and navel. To the devotees he seemed a child playing with
flowers.
Sri Ramakrishna used to tell the devotees that his divine visions and moods were
accompanied by the rising of a spiritual current inside his body.Now he talked to M.
MASTER: "I don't remember when the current went up. Now I am in the mood of a child.
That is why I am playing with the flowers this way.
Master's exalted vision
Do you know what I see now? I see my body as a frame made of bamboo strips and
covered with a cloth. The frame moves. And it moves because someone dwells inside it.
"Again, I see the body to be like a pumpkin with the seeds scooped out. Inside this body
there is no trace of passion or worldly attachment. It is all very clean inside, and- "
It became very painful for Sri Ramakrishna to talk further. He felt very weak. M. quickly
guessed what the Master wanted to tell the devotees, and said, "And you are seeing God
inside yourself."
MASTER: "Both inside and outside. The Indivisible Satchidananda-I see It both inside
and outside. It has merely assumed this sheath [meaning his body] for a support and
exists both inside and outside. I clearly perceive this."
M. and Hirananda listened intently to these words about his exalted state of God-
Consciousness. A few moments later Sri Ramakrishna looked at them and resumed the
conversation.
MASTER: "You all seem to me to be my kinsmen. I do not look on any of you as a
stranger.
"I see you all as so many sheaths, and the heads are moving.
"I notice that when my mind is united with God the suffering of the body is left aside.
"No I perceive only this: the Indivisible Satchidananda is covered with skin, and this sore
in
the
throat is on one side of it."
The Master again fell silent. A few minutes later he said: "The attributes of matter are
superimposed on Spirit, and the attributes of Spirit are superimposed on matter.
Therefore when the body is ill a man says, 'I am ill.' "
Hirananda wanted to understand what the Master had just said; so M. told him, "Then
hot water scalds the hand, people say that the water scalds; but the truth is that it is the
heat that scalds."
Master and Hirananda
HIRANANDA (to the Master): "Please tell us why a devotee of God suffers."
MASTER: "It is the body that suffers."Sri Ramakrishna seemed about to say something more. Hirananda and M. eagerly
awaited his words.
Sri Ramakrishna said, "Do you understand?"
M. said to Hirananda, in a whisper: "The body suffers for the purpose of teaching men.
His life is like a book of reference. In spite of so much physical suffering, his mind is one
hundred percent united with God."
HIRANANDA: "Yes, it is like Christ's crucifixion. But still the mystery remains-why should
he, of all people, suffer like this?"
M: "The Master says it is the will of the Divine Mother. This is how She is sporting
through his body."
The two devotees were talking in whispers. Sri Ramakrishna asked Hirananda, by a sign,
what
M. was talking about. Since Hirananda could not understand the sign, Sri Ramakrishna
repeated it.
HIRANANDA: "He says that your illness is for the teaching of men."
MASTER: "But that's only his guess.
(To M. and Hirananda) "My mood is changing. I think that I should not say to everyone,
'May your spiritual consciousness be awakened.' People are so sinful in the Kaliyuga; if I
awaken their spiritual consciousness I shall have to accept the burden of their sins."
M. (to Hirananda): "He will not awaken people's spiritual consciousness except at the
right time. When a person is ready, he will awaken his spiritual consciousness."
Friday, April 23, 1886
It was Good Friday. Hirananda had taken his midday meal at the Cossipore garden
house. About one o'clock in the afternoon he was stroking Sri Ramakrishna's feet. M. sat
near by. Lātu and one or two other devotees were going in and out of the room. It was
the Master's earnest desire that Hirananda should stay for some time at the Cossipore
garden house.
While massaging the Master's feet, Hirananda conversed with him. He spoke in a very
sweet voice, as if trying to console a child.
HIRANANDA: "Why should you worry so much? You can enjoy peace of mind if you have
faith in the physician. You are a child."
MASTER (to M.): "How can I have faith in the doctor? Dr. Sarkar said that I would not
recover."HIRANANDA: "But why should you worry so much about that? What is to happen must
happen."
M. (to Hirananda, aside): "He is not worrying about himself. The preservation of his body
is for the welfare of the devotees."
It was a sultry day and the room became very hot at noontime. The straw screens had
been hung over the windows. Hirananda adjusted them. The Master looked at him.
MASTER (to Hirananda): "Please don't forget to send the pajamas."
Hirananda had told Sri Ramakrishna that he would feel more comfortable if he wore the
pajamas used in Sindh. Sri Ramakrishna was reminding him of them.
Hirananda had not eaten well. The rice had not been well cooked. The Master felt very
sorry about it and asked him again and again whether he would have some
refreshments. On account of his illness he could hardly talk; but still he repeated the
question. He said to Lātu, "Did you too eat that rice?'
Sri Ramakrishna could hardly keep the cloth on his body. He was almost always naked,
like a child. Hirananda had brought with him one or two of his Brahmo friends. Therefore
every now and then the Master pulled the cloth to his waist.
MASTER (to Hirananda): "Will you take me for an uncivilized person if I don't cover my
body with my cloth?"
HIRANANDA: "What difference does that make with you? You are but a child."
MASTER (pointing to a Brahmo devotee): "But he feels that way"
Hirananda was about to take his leave. In a very few days he was going to start for
Sindh.
MASTER (to Hirananda): "Suppose you don't go to Sindh."
HIRANANDA (smiling): "But there is nobody there to do my work. I have my duties."
MASTER: "How much do you earn?"
HIRANANDA (smiling): "My work doesn't bring me a large salary."
MASTER: "Still, how much?"
Hirananda laughed.
MASTER: "Why don't you live here?"Hirananda did not reply.
MASTER: "Suppose you give up the job."
Hirananda said nothing. He was ready to take his leave.
MASTER: "When will you see me again?"
HlRANANDA: "I shall leave for Sindh on Monday, the day after tomorrow I shall see you
that morning."
Hirananda left.
M. was seated by the Master's side.
MASTER (to M.): "He is a fine young man, isn't he?"
M: "Yes, sir. He has a very sweet nature."
MASTER: "He said that Sindh is twenty-two hundred miles from Calcutta; and he has
come all that way to see me."
M: "True, Sir. That would be impossible without real love."
MASTER: "He wants very much to take me to Sindh."
M: "The journey is very painful. It takes four or five days by train."
MASTER: "He has three university degrees."
M: "Yes, sir."
Sri Ramakrishna was tired. He wanted to take a little rest. He asked M. to open the
shutters of the windows and spread the straw mat over his bed. M. was fanning him. Sri
Ramakrishna became drowsy.
After a short nap Sri Ramakrishna said to M., "Did I sleep?"
M: "A little."
Narendra, Sarat, and M. were talking downstairs.
NARENDRA: "How amazing it is! One learns hardly anything though one reads books for
many years. How can a man realize God by practising sādhanā for two or three days? Is
it so easy to realize God? (To Sarat) You have obtained peace. M., too, has obtained it.
But I have no peace."It was afternoon. Many devotees were sitting in the Master's room. Narendra, Sarat,
Śaśi, Lātu, Nityagopal, Girish, Ram, M., and Suresh were present.
Kedār came in. This was his first visit to the Master for some time. While staying in
Dāccā, in connection with his official duties, he had heard of Sri Ramakrishna's illness.
On entering Sri Ramakrishna's room he took the dust of the Master's feet on his head
and then joyously gave it to the others. The devotees accepted it with bowed heads. As
he offered it to Sarat, the latter himself took the dust of Sri Ramakrishna's feet. M.
smiled. The Master also smiled, looking at M. The devotees sat without uttering a word.
Sri Ramakrishna seemed about to go into an ecstatic mood. Now and then he breathed
heavily as if trying to suppress his emotion. He said to Kedār, by a sign, "Argue with
Girish."
Girish said to Kedār: "Sir, I beg your pardon. At first I did not know who you were. That
is why I argued with you. But now it is quite different."
Sri Ramakrishna smiled.
The Master drew Kedār's attention to Narendra and said: "He has renounced everything.
(To the devotees) Kedār once said to Narendra, 'You may reason and argue now, but in
the end you will roll on the ground, chanting Hari's name.' (To Narendra) Take the dust
of Kedār's feet."
KEDĀR (to Narendra): "Take the dust of his [meaning the Master's] feet. That will do."
Surendra was seated behind the other devotees. The Master looked at him with a smile
and said to Kedār, "Ah, how sweet his nature is!" Kedār understood the Master's hint and
went toward Surendra.
Surendra was very sensitive. Some of the devotees had been collecting funds from the
householder devotees to meet the expenses of the Cossipore garden house. Surendra
felt piqued at this. He was bearing most of the expenses himself.
SURENDRA (to Kedār): "How can I sit near all these holy people? A few days ago some
of them [referring to Narendra] put on the ochre robe of the sannyāsi and went on a
pilgrimage to Buddha-Gaya. They wanted to see bigger sādhus there."
Sri Ramakrishna was trying to console Surendra. He said: "You are right. They are mere
children. They don't know what is good."
SURENDRA (to Kedār): "Doesn't our gurudeva know our inner feeling? He does not care
for money. It is our inner attitude that pleases him."
Sri Ramakrishna with a nod of his head approved Surendra's words.
The devotees had brought various food offerings for the Master and placed them in front
of him. Sri Ramakrishna put a grain on his tongue and gave the plate to Surendra. Heasked Surendra to distribute the Prasad to the devotees. Surendra went downstairs with
the offerings.
MASTER (to Kedār): "You had better go downstairs and explain it all to Surendra. See
that they don't get into any hot arguments."
M. was fanning Sri Ramakrishna. The Master said to him, "Won't you eat anything?" He
sent M. downstairs.
Girish and M.
It was about dusk. Girish and M. were strolling near the small reservoir in the garden. '
GIRISH: "I understand that you are writing something about the Master. Is it true?"
M: "Who told you that?"
GIRISH: "I have heard about it. Will you give it to me?"
M: "No, I won't part with it unless I feel it is right to do so. I am writing it for myself, not
for others."
GIRISH: "What do you mean?"
M: "You may get it when I die."
It was evening. A lamp was lighted in the Master's room. Amrita Basu, a Brahmo
devotee, came in. Sri Ramakrishna had expressed his eagerness to see him. M. and a
few other devotees were there. A garland of jasmine lay in front of the Master on a
plantain-leaf. There was perfect silence in the room. A great yogi seemed to be silently
communing with God. Every now and then the Master lifted the garland a little, as if he
wanted to put it around his neck.
AMRITA (tenderly): "Shall I put it around your neck?"
Sri Ramakrishna accepted the garland. He had a long conversation with Amrita. When
the latter was about to take his leave, the Master said, "Come again."
AMRITA: "Yes, sir. I like to come very much. But I live at a great distance; so I cannot
always come."
MASTER: "Do come, and take the carriage hire from here."
The devotees were amazed at the Master's tender love for Amrita.Master's kindness to M. and his wife
The next day M. came to the garden house accompanied by his wife and a son. The boy
was seven years old. It was at the Master's request that he brought his wife, who was
almost mad with grief owing to the death of one of her sons.
That day the Master several times allowed M.'s wife the privilege of waiting on him. Her
welfare seemed to occupy his attention a great deal. In the evening the Holy Mother
came to the Master's room to feed him. M.'s wife accompanied her with a lamp. The
Master tenderly asked her many questions about her household. He requested her to
come again to the garden house and spend a few days with the Holy Mother, not
forgetting to ask her to bring her baby daughter. When the Master had finished his meal
M.'s wife removed the plates. He chatted with her a few minutes.
About nine o'clock in the evening Sri Ramakrishna was seated in his room with the
devotees. He had a garland of flowers around his neck. He told M. that he had requested
his wife to spend a few days at the garden house with the Holy Mother. His kindness
touched M.'s heart.
M. was fanning him. The Master took the garland from his neck and said something to
himself. Then in a very benign mood he gave the garland to M.
