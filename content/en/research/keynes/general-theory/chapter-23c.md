<!-- Silvio Gesell (1862-1930) is an unduly neglected prophet. His work has flashes of deep insight. He only just failed to reach down to the essence of the matter. 

In the post-war years, his devotees bombarded me with copies of his works.  -->

<!-- Yet, owing to certain palpable defects in the argument, I entirely failed to discover their merit.  -->

<!-- As is often the case with imperfectly analysed intuitions, their significance only became apparent after I had reached my own conclusions in my own way. 

Meanwhile, like other academic economists, I treated his profoundly original strivings as being no better than those of a crank. Since few of the readers of this book are likely to be well acquainted with the significance of Gesell, I will give to him what would be otherwise a disproportionate space.  -->

Gesell was a successful German[26] merchant in Buenos Aires. He studied monetary problems by the crisis of the late ’80s, which was especially violent in Argentina. 

His first work, *Die Reformation im Münzwesen als Brücke zum socialen Staat* was published in Buenos Aires in 1891. 

<!-- His fundamental ideas on money were published in Buenos Aires in the same year under the title Nervus rerum, and many books and pamphlets followed until he retired to Switzerland in 1906 as a man of some means, able to devote the last decades of his life to the two most delightful occupations open to those who do not have to earn their living, authorship and experimental farming.  -->

<!-- The first section of his standard work was published in 1906 at Les Hauts Geneveys, Switzerland, under the title Die Verwirklichung des Rechtes auf dem vollen Arbeitsertrag, and the second section in 1911 at Berlin under the title Die neue Lehre vom Zins. The two together were published in Berlin and in Switzerland during the war (1916) and reached a sixth edition during his lifetime under the title Die natürliche Wirtschaftsordnung durch Freiland und Freigeld, the English version (translated by Mr. Philip Pye) being called The Natural Economic Order.  -->

<!-- In April 1919, Gesell joined the short-lived Soviet cabinet of Bavaria as their Minister of Finance, being subsequently tried by court-martial. 

The last decade of his life was spent in Berlin and Switzerland and devoted to propaganda. Gesell, drawing to himself the semi-religious fervour which had formerly centred round Henry George, became the revered prophet of a cult with many thousand disciples throughout the world. The first international convention of the Swiss and German Freiland-Freigeld Bund and similar organisations from many countries was held in Basle in 1923. 

Since his death in 1930 much of the peculiar type of fervour which doctrines such as his are capable of exciting has been diverted to other (in my opinion less eminent) prophets. Dr. Büchi is the leader of the movement in England, but its literature seems to be distributed from San Antonio, Texas, its main strength lying to-day in the United States, where Professor Irving Fisher, alone amongst academic economists, has recognised its significance. 

In spite of the prophetic trappings with which his devotees have decorated him, Gesell’s main book is written in cool, scientific language; though it is suffused throughout by a more passionate, a more emotional devotion to social justice than some think decent in a scientist.  -->

The part which derives from Henry George,[27] though doubtless an important source of the movement’s strength, is of altogether secondary interest.

My book's purpose is to establish an anti-Marxian socialism. It is a reaction against laissez-faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx. His is based on:
- a repudiation of the classical hypotheses, and
- an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition

The future will learn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx. 

The preface to The Natural Economic Order shows the moral quality of Gesell. It is the answer to Marxism. 

Gesell’s specific contribution to the theory of money and interest is as follows. 

He distinguishes clearly between:
- the interest rate and
- the marginal efficiency of capital. 

He argues that:
- it is the interest rate that limits the rate of growth of real capital. 
- the interest rate is a purely monetary phenomenon arising from the fact that money has carrying expenses.
<!-- - the peculiarity of money, from which flows the significance of the money rate of interest, lies in the fact that its ownership as a means of storing wealth involves the holder in negligible carrying charges -->

<!-- , and that forms of wealth, such as stocks of commodities which do involve carrying charges, in fact yield a return because of the standard set by money.  -->

He cites the comparative stability of interest rates throughout the ages as evidence that it cannot depend on purely physical characters, inasmuch as the variation of the latter from one epoch to another must have been incalculably greater than the observed changes in the rate of interest.

It means that the interest rate depends on constant psychological characters. It has remained stable, whilst the widely fluctuating characters, which primarily determine the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, have determined not the rate of interest but the rate at which the (more or less) given rate of interest allows the stock of real capital to grow.

Gesell's theory's great defect is that he shows how it is only the money interest rate which allows a yield to be obtained from lending out stocks of commodities.

His dialogue between Robinson Crusoe and a stranger[28] is a most excellent economic parable — as good as anything of the kind that has been written — to demonstrate this point. But, having given the reason why the money-rate of interest unlike most commodity rates of interest cannot be negative, he altogether overlooks the need of an explanation why the money-rate of interest is positive, and he fails to explain why the money-rate of interest is not governed (as the classical school maintains) by the standard set by the yield on productive capital. 

This is because the notion of liquidity-preference had escaped him. He has constructed only half a theory of the rate of interest. The incompleteness of his theory is doubtless the explanation of his work having suffered neglect at the hands of the academic world. Nevertheless he had carried his theory far enough to lead him to a practical recommendation, which may carry with it the essence of what is needed, though it is not feasible in the form in which he proposed it. 

He argues that the growth of real capital is held back by the money-rate of interest, and that if this brake were removed the growth of real capital would be, in the modern world, so rapid that a zero money-rate of interest would probably be justified, not indeed forthwith, but within a comparatively short period of time. Thus the prime necessity is to reduce the money-rate of interest, and this, he pointed out, can be effected by causing money to incur carrying-costs just like other stocks of barren goods. This led him to the famous prescription of “stamped” money, with which his name is chiefly associated and which has received the blessing of Professor Irving Fisher. 

According to this proposal currency notes (though it would clearly need to apply as well to some forms at least of bank-money) would only retain their value by being stamped each month, like an insurance card, with stamps purchased at a post office. The cost of the stamps could, of course, be fixed at any appropriate figure. According to my theory it should be roughly equal to the excess of the money-rate of interest (apart from the stamps) over the marginal efficiency of capital corresponding to a rate of new investment compatible with full employment. The actual charge suggested by Gesell was 1 per mil. per month, equivalent to 5.4% per annum. 

This would be too high in existing conditions, but the correct figure, which would have to be changed from time to time, could only be reached by trial and error. The idea behind stamped money is sound. It is, indeed, possible that means might be found to apply it in practice on a modest scale. But there are many difficulties which Gesell did not face. 

He was unaware that money was not unique in having a liquidity-premium attached to it, but differed only in degree from many other articles, deriving its importance from having a greater liquidity-premium than any other article. 

Thus if currency notes were to be deprived of their liquidity-premium by the stamping system, a long series of substitutes would step into their shoes — bank-money, debts at call, foreign money, jewellery and the precious metals generally, and so forth. As I have mentioned above, there have been times when it was probably the craving for the ownership of land, independently of its yield, which served to keep up the rate of interest; — though under Gesell’s system this possibility would have been eliminated by land nationalisation. 

<!-- VII  -->

The theories which we have examined above are directed, in substance, to the constituent of effective demand which depends on the sufficiency of the inducement to invest. It is no new thing, however, to ascribe the evils of unemployment to the insufficiency of the other constituent, namely, the insufficiency of the propensity to consume. 

But this alternative explanation of the economic evils of the day — equally unpopular with the classical economists — played a much smaller part in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century thinking and has only gathered force in comparatively recent times. 

Complaints of under-consumption were a very subsidiary aspect of mercantilist thought. Heckscher quotes a number of examples of what he calls “the deep-rooted belief in the utility of luxury and the evil of thrift. 

Thrift was regarded as the cause of unemployment, and for two reasons= 

1. Because real income was believed to diminish by the amount of money which did not enter into exchange, 
2. Because saving was believed to withdraw money from circulation."[29] 

In 1598, Laffemas (Les Trésors et richesses pour mettre l'Estat en Splendeur) denounced the objectors to the use of French silks on the ground that all purchasers of French luxury goods created a livelihood for the poor, whereas the miser caused them to die in distress.[30] 

In 1662, Petty justified “entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches, etc.”, on the ground that their costs flowed back into the pockets of brewers, bakers, tailors, shoemakers and so forth. Fortrey justified “excess of apparel”. Von Schrötter (1686) deprecated sumptuary regulations and declared that he would wish that display in clothing and the like were even greater. 

Barbon (1690) wrote that “Prodigality is a vice that is prejudicial to the Man, but not to trade. ... Covetousness is a Vice, prejudicial both to Man and Trade.” [31] In 1695 Cary argued that if everybody spent more, all would obtain larger incomes “and might then live more plentifully”.[32] But it was by Bernard Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees that Barbon’s opinion was mainly popularised, a book convicted as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex in 1723, which stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation. Only one man is recorded as having spoken a good word for it, namely Dr. Johnson, who declared that it did not puzzle him, but “opened his eyes into real life very much”.

## Mandeville

The nature of the book’s wickedness can be best conveyed by Leslie Stephen’s summary in the Dictionary of National Biography= Mandeville gave great offence by this book, in which a cynical system of morality was made attractive by ingenious paradoxes.

His doctrine that prosperity was increased by expenditure rather than by saving fell in with many current economic fallacies not yet extinct.[33] Assuming with the ascetics that human desires were essentially evil and therefore produced “private vices” and assuming with the common view that wealth was a “public benefit”, he easily showed that all civilisation implied the development of vicious propensities.

The text of the Fable of the Bees is an allegorical poem — “The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves turned honest”, in which is set forth the appalling plight of a prosperous community in which all the citizens suddenly take it into their heads to abandon luxurious living, and the State to cut down armaments, in the interests of Saving= No Honour now could be content, To live and owe for what was spent, Liv’ries in Broker’s shops are hung; 

They part with Coaches for a song; Sell stately Horses by whole sets; And Country-Houses to pay debts. Vain cost is shunn’d as moral Fraud; They have no Forces kept Abroad; Laugh at th’ Esteem of Foreigners, And empty Glory got by Wars; They fight, but for their Country’s sake, When Right or Liberty’s at Stake. The haughty Chloe Contracts th’ expensive Bill of Fare, And wears her strong Suit a whole Year. And what is the result? — Now mind the glorious Hive, and see How Honesty and Trade agree= The Shew is gone, it thins apace; And looks with quite another Face, For ’twas not only they that went, By whom vast sums were yearly spent; 

But Multitudes that lived on them, Were daily forc’d to do the same. In vain to other Trades they’d fly; All were o’er-stocked accordingly. The price of Land and Houses falls; Mirac’lous Palaces whose Walls, Like those of Thebes, were rais’d by Play, Are to be let ... The Building Trade is quite destroy’d, Artificers are not employ’d; No limner for his Art is fam’d, Stone-cutters, Carvers are not nam’d. So “The Moral” is= are Virtue can’t make Nations live In Splendour. They that would revive A Golden Age, must be as free, For Acorns as for Honesty. Two extracts from the commentary which follows the allegory will show that the above was not without a theoretical basis= 

As this prudent economy, which some people call Saving, is in private families the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) will have the same effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours. 

This, I think, is an error.[34] 

On the contrary, Mandeville concludes= The great art to make a nation happy, and what we call flourishing, consists in giving everybody an opportunity of being employed; which to compass, let a Government’s first care be to promote as great a variety of Manufactures, Arts and Handicrafts as human wit can invent; and the second to encourage Agriculture and Fishery in all their branches, that the whole Earth may be forced to exert itself as well as Man. It is from this Policy and not from the trifling regulations of Lavishness and Frugality that the greatness and felicity of Nations must be expected; for let the value of Gold and Silver rise or fall, the enjoyment of all Societies will ever depend upon the Fruits of the Earth and the Labour of the People; both which joined together are a more certain, a more inexhaustible and a more real Treasure than the Gold of Brazil or the Silver of Potosi. 

No wonder that such wicked sentiments called down the opprobrium of two centuries of moralists and economists who felt much more virtuous in possession of their austere doctrine that no sound remedy was discoverable except in the utmost of thrift and economy both by the individual and by the state. Petty’s “entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches, etc.” gave place to the penny-wisdom of Gladstonian finance and to a state system which “could not afford” hospitals, open spaces, noble buildings, even the preservation of its ancient monuments, far less the splendours of music and the drama, all of which were consigned to the private charity or magnanimity of improvident individuals. The doctrine did not reappear in respectable circles for another century, until in the later phase of Malthus the notion of the insufficiency of effective demand takes a definite place as a scientific explanation of unemployment. Since I have already dealt with this somewhat fully in my essay on Malthus,[35] it will be sufficient if I repeat here one or two characteristic passages which I have already quoted in my essay= We see in almost every part of the world vast powers of production which are not put into action, and I explain this phenomenon by saying that from the want of a proper distribution of the actual produce adequate motives are not furnished to continued production. 

I distinctly maintain that an attempt to accumulate very rapidly, which necessarily implies a considerable diminution of unproductive consumption, by greatly impairing the usual motives to production must prematurely check the progress of wealth. ... But if it be true that an attempt to accumulate very rapidly will occasion such a division between labour and profits as almost to destroy both the motive and the power of future accumulation and consequently the power of maintaining and employing an increasing population, must it not be acknowledged that such an attempt to accumulate, or that saving too much, may be really prejudicial to a country? [36] 

The question is whether this stagnation of capital, and subsequent stagnation in the demand for labour arising from increased production without an adequate proportion of unproductive consumption on the part of the landlords and capitalists, could take place without prejudice to the country, without occasioning a less degree both of happiness and wealth than would have occurred if the unproductive consumption of the landlords and capitalists had been so proportioned to the natural surplus of the society as to have continued uninterrupted the motives to production, and prevented first an unnatural demand for labour and then a necessary and sudden diminution of such demand. 

But if this be so, how can it be said with truth that parsimony, though it may be prejudicial to the producers, cannot be prejudicial to the state; or that an increase of unproductive consumption among landlords and capitalists may not sometimes be the proper remedy for a state of things in which the motives to production fails?[37] 
 -->

## Adam Smith

Adam Smith has stated that capitals are increased by parsimony, that every frugal man is a public benefactor, and that the increase of wealth depends upon the balance of produce above consumption. That these propositions are true to a great extent is perfectly unquestionable. ... But it is quite obvious that they are not true to an indefinite extent, and that the principles of saving, pushed to excess, would destroy the motive to production. If every person were satisfied with the simplest food, the poorest clothing and the meanest houses, it is certain that no other sort of food, clothing, and lodging would be in existence. ... The two extremes are obvious; and it follows that there must be some intermediate point, though the resources of political economy may not be able to ascertain it, where, taking into consideration both the power to produce and the will to consume, the encouragement to the increase of wealth is the greatest.[38] Of all the opinions advanced by able and ingenious men, which I have ever met with, the opinion of M. Say, which states that= un product consommé ou détruit est un débouché fermé (I. i. ch. 15), appears to me to be the most directly opposed to just theory, and the most uniformly contradicted by experience. 

Yet it directly follows from the new doctrine, that commodities are to be considered only in their relation to each other, — not to the consumers. What, I would ask, would become of the demand for commodities, if all consumption except bread and water were suspended for the next half-year? What an accumulation of commodities! Quels débouchés! What a prodigious market would this event occasion![39] Ricardo, however, was stone-deaf to what Malthus was saying. 


### Mill

<!-- The last echo of the controversy is to be found in John Stuart Mill’s discussion of his Wages-Fund Theory, [40] which in his own mind played a vital part in his rejection of the later phase of Malthus, amidst the discussions of which he had, of course, been brought up.  -->

Mill’s successors rejected his Wages-Fund Theory but overlooked the fact that Mill’s refutation of Malthus depended on it.

<!-- Their method was to dismiss the problem from the corpus of Economics not by solving it but by not mentioning it. It altogether disappeared from controversy. Mr. Cairncross, searching recently for traces of it amongst the minor Victorians, [41] has found even less, perhaps, than might have been expected. [42]  -->
