The struggle over money-wages is often believed to determine the general level of real wages. 

Workers have an imperfect mobility.
- Wages do not tend to an exact equality of net advantage in different occupations. 
- Anyone who accepts lower money-wages relative to others, will get lower real wages.
- This makes workers resist it.

On the other hand, it would be impracticable to resist every reduction of real wages, due to inflation.
- Workers do not resist this unless the inflation is extreme.

<!-- a change in the purchasing-power of money which affects all workers alike; and in fact reductions of real wages arising in this way are not, as a rule, resisted unless they proceed to an extreme degree.  -->

A resistance against lower money-wages <!-- applying to particular industries --> does affect <!-- not raise the same insuperable bar to --> an increase in aggregate employment <!-- which would result from a similar --> as a resistance against lower real wages does.

In other words, the struggle on money-wages primarily affects **the distribution of the aggregate real wage** between different labour-groups. 
<!-- - It not its average amount per unit of employment, which depends on a different set of forces.  -->

A union of a group of workers is for the protection of their relative real wage.

<!--  The general level of real wages depends on the other forces of the economic system. -->

Workers unconsciously:
- resist reductions of money-wages
- do not resist reductions of real wages from increases in aggregate employment

These make them instinctively more reasonable than the Classical economists. 


<!-- , which are seldom or never of an all-round character, even though the existing real equivalent of these wages exceeds the marginal disutility of the existing employment; 

do not resist reductions of real wages, which are associated with increases in aggregate employment and leave relative money-wages unchanged, unless the reduction proceeds so far as to threaten a reduction of the real wage below the marginal disutility of the existing volume of employment.  -->


The Classical school says that unions will block any increase in aggregate employment. 
- But this is wrong because trade unions:
  - resist cuts in money-wages.
  - do not go on strike for every rise in the cost of living*.

‘Involuntary’ unemployment does not mean the mere existence of an unexhausted capacity to work. 

‘Frictional’ unemployment is not ‘involuntary’ unemployment. 

<!-- An 8-hour day does not constitute unemployment because it is not beyond human capacity to work ten hours. Nor should we regard as ‘involuntary’ unemployment the withdrawal of their labour by a body of workers because they do not choose to work for less than a certain real reward.  -->

A small rise in the price of consumer goods relative to the money wage can cause ‘involuntary’ unemployment when both of the following are greater than the existing volume of employment:
- the aggregate supply of labour willing to work for the <!-- current --> low value money-wage and
- the aggregate demand for such labour at that low value wage 

<!-- in the event of   wage-goods relatively to the money-wage,  -->

<!-- An alternative definition, which amounts, however, to the same thing, will be given in the next chapter (p. 26 below). -->

This means that the second postulate means:
- ‘full’ employment, and
- an absence of ‘involuntary’ unemployment.


[Marginal disutility of employment means workers refusing to work for slave wages.]

<!-- It follows from this definition that the equality of the real wage to the marginal disutility of employment [workers refusing to work for slave wages] presupposed by the , realistically interpreted, corresponds to the   -->

<!-- This state of affairs we shall describe as , both ‘frictional’ and ‘voluntary’ unemployment being consistent with ‘full” employment thus defined.  -->

<!-- This fits in, we shall find, with other characteristics of the classical theory, which is best regarded as a theory of distribution in conditions of full employment. So long as the classical postulates hold good, unemployment, which is in the above sense involuntary, cannot occur.  -->

Therefore, "apparent unemployment" is the result of temporary loss of:
- work of the ‘between jobs’ type or
- intermittent demand for highly specialised resources or 
- the employment of free labour from the effect of a trade union ‘closed shop’ 

Thus Classical economists <!--  writers in the classical tradition, overlooking the special assumption underlying their theory, have been driven inevitably to the conclusion, perfectly logical on their assumption, --> concluded that apparent unemployment is caused by a refusal by the unemployed to accept a reward* which corresponds to their marginal productivity. 

> *Superphysics Note: In a depression, real wages become slave wages due to the reduced total economic activity. 


A classical economist may sympathise with workers refusing to accept lower money-wages. But such a condition is temporary. <!-- , and he will admit that it may not be wise to make it to meet conditions which are temporary; but --> Scientific integrity forces him to declare that this refusal is the cause of the problem.

If the classical theory is only applicable to the case of full employment, it is wrong to apply it to the problems of involuntary unemploymen if there be such a thing. 

The classical theorists resemble Euclidean geometers in a non-Euclidean world. They discover parallel lines often meet. They rebuke the lines for not keeping straight. But the real <!--  as the only remedy for the unfortunate collisions which are occurring. Yet, in truth, there is no  -->remedy is to throw away* the axiom of parallels and to work out a non-Euclidean geometry. 

> *Superphysics Note= Here Keynes blames Classical theory for staying with non-profit maximizing, non-monetary paradigm. He urges it to go with the current corrupted reality. 


Something similar is required today in economics. We need to throw over the second postulate of the classical doctrine and to work out a system where involuntary unemployment is possible.
