AN act of individual saving is a decision not to have dinner today. But it does lead to a spending of that saving to buy dinner at a later date. 

<!--  not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence or a year hence or to consume any specified thing at any specified date.  -->

Thus, it depresses the food service business <!-- of preparing to-day’s dinner --> or other consumption businesses. <!--  without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption. --> It is a net reduction of such demand. <!-- not a substitution of future consumption-demand for present consumption-demand. --> 

The expectation of future consumption is based on present consumption. A reduction in present consumption will likely depress future consumption. This will result in the act of saving:
- depressing the price of consumption-goods
- leaving the marginal efficiency of existing capital unaffected. 

It might depress the latter also by present investment-demand and present consumption-demand. 

It will be different if the saving was meant for a future spending. <!-- If saving consisted not merely in abstaining from present consumption but in placing simultaneously a specific order for future consumption, the effect might indeed be different.  --> In this case, the expectation of some future yield from investment would be improved. The resources saved could be used for preparing for that future consumption. 

<!-- Not that they necessarily would be, even in this case, on a scale equal to the amount of resources released; since the desired interval of delay might require a method of production so inconveniently “roundabout” as to have an efficiency well below the current rate of interest, with the result that the favourable effect on employment of the forward order for consumption would eventuate not at once but at some subsequent date, so that the immediate effect of the saving would still be adverse to employment.  -->

<!-- An individual decision to save does not involve the placing of any specific forward order for consumption, but merely the cancellation of a present order.  -->

The expectation of consumption is the only raison d'être of employment.
- A reduced propensity to consume depresses employment. 

The act of saving implies a desire for “wealth” for a future time. It does guarantee a future consumption. 

<!-- It does not substitute our present consumption of some specific additional consumption which requires for its preparation just as much immediate economic activity as would have been required by present consumption equal in value to the sum saved, but  -->

The idea that individual saving* is just as good for effective demand as an act of individual consumption is false.
{{< /c >}}


> *Superphysics Note: Here, Keynes confuses "saving" with "abstaining" or putting money under a pillow. Classical savings always implies saving money in a bank. Thus, the correct Classical phrase is: 'Individual saving IN A BANK is just as good for effective demand'


<!-- The absurd, though almost universal, idea that an act of , has been fostered by the fallacy, much more specious than the conclusion derived from it, that  -->

Classical Economics has a fallacy that an increased desire to hold wealth is the same thing as an increased desire to hold investments.
- This desire:
  - increases the demand for investments
  - stimulates their production.
- In this way, current investment is promoted by individual saving just as present consumption is reduced.

These are fallacies coming from the idea that the owner of wealth wants a capital-asset for the sake of that asset* instead for its prospective yield.

> *Superphysics Note: This desire is actually the desire for security which Keynes called "precautionary-motive" in Chapter 13. Adam Smith mentions this as kings hoarding treasure (massive treasure-saving) for the sake of security. How could Keynes forget his own principles? Here, he is strangely imposing the "transactions-motive" on capital-owners, like telling an apple to be an orange.


**Prospective yield wholly depends on the expectation of future effective demand in relation to future conditions of supply.**
- If an act of saving does nothing to improve prospective yield, it does not stimulate investment.
- For an individual saver to attain his desired goal of owning wealth, a new capital-asset is not needed to be produced to satisfy him. 

<!-- The mere act of saving by one individual  , being two-sided as we have shown above, forces some other individual to transfer to him some article of wealth old or new. Every act of saving involves a “forced” inevitable transfer of wealth to him who saves, though he in his turn may suffer from the saving of others. These transfers of wealth do not require the creation of new wealth — indeed, as we have seen, they may be actively inimical to it. -->

The creation of new wealth wholly depends on the prospective yield of the new wealth reaching the standard set by the current interest rate*.
- The prospective yield of the marginal new investment is not increased by someone wanting to increase his wealth. This is because the prospective yield of the marginal new investment depends on the expectation of a demand<!--  for a specific article at a specific date -->. 

> *Superphysics Note: Here Keynes imposes investmetns to mean money-investments  


I impose that the owner of wealth wants <!--  is not a given prospective yield but --> the best available prospective yield. 
- In this way, an increased desire to have wealth now reduces the prospective future yield.
- Debt and money markets are also capital-assets, and so  the prospective yield <!-- with which the producers of new investment have to be content --> cannot fall below <!-- the standard set by --> the current interest rate. 

<!-- with which the producers of new investment have to be content. For this overlooks the fact that there is always an alternative to the ownership of real capital-assets, namely the ownership of money and debts; so that  -->

Interest rate depends<!-- , as we have seen, not on the strength of the desire to hold wealth, but --> on the strengths of the desires to hold wealth in liquid and in illiquid forms relative to <!--  respectively, coupled with the amount of --> the supply of wealth <!-- in the one form relatively to the supply of it in the other -->. 

<!-- If the reader still finds himself perplexed, let him ask himself why,  -->

If the quantity of money is unchanged, a fresh act of saving reduces the liquid money. <!--  should diminish the sum which it is desired to keep in liquid form at the existing rate of interest.  -->

<!-- Certain deeper perplexities, which may arise when we try to probe still further into the whys and wherefores, will be considered in the next chapter. II  -->




## Keynes Overturns the Classical Productive and Unproductive Capital in Favor of Money-Returns 

Instead of calling capital as "productive" it would be better to say that capital has a yield over the course of its life in excess of its original cost.

An asset's scarcity gives it a higher <!--  offers a prospect of yielding during its life services having an --> aggregate value greater than its initial supply price. It is kept scarce because of the competition of the interest rate on money. 

If capital becomes less scarce, the excess yield will diminish. Yet it will stay as productive at least in the physical sense*.


> *Superhysics Note: Here, Keynes applies sophistry. If everyone has access to a capital equipment, then the old capital equipment will not be used as much, rendering it less productive per equipment-unit. For example, 4G in mobile phones has made wifi routers unnecessary and therefore less productive to the eyes of society. 



<!-- I sympathise, therefore, with the pre-classical doctrine that everything is produced by labour, aided by what used to be called art and is now called technique, by natural resources which are free or cost a rent according to their scarcity or abundance, and by the results of past labour, embodied in assets, which also command a price according to their scarcity or abundance.  -->

We should <!-- It is preferable to --> regard labour*, including, of course, the personal services of the entrepreneur and his assistants, as the sole factor of production, operating in a given environment of:
- technique
- natural resources
- capital equipment
- effective demand. 

> *Superphysics Note= Here, Keynes makes land and stock subservient to labor, different from the Classical notion that puts all three as equal. Under Keynes' reasoning, money can be eased as to employ humans to make Antartica or the Sahara productive. This is absurd.   


This is why I used the unit of labour [common-labour] as the sole physical unit needed in my economic system, apart from units of money [money-wage] and time [hour]. 

<!-- It is true that some lengthy or roundabout processes are physically efficient. 

But so are some short processes. Lengthy processes are not physically efficient because they are long. Some, probably most, lengthy processes would be physically very inefficient, for there are such things as spoiling or wasting with time.[1] 

With a given labour force there is a definite limit to the quantity of labour embodied in roundabout processes which can be used to advantage. Apart from other considerations, there must be a due proportion between the amount of labour employed in making machines and the amount which will be employed in using them. The ultimate quantity of value will not increase indefinitely, relatively to the quantity of labour employed, as the processes adopted become more and more roundabout, even if their physical efficiency is still increasing. 

Only if the desire to postpone consumption were strong enough to produce a situation in which full employment required a volume of investment so great as to involve a negative marginal efficiency of capital, would a process become advantageous merely because it was lengthy; in which event we should employ physically inefficient processes, provided they were sufficiently lengthy for the gain from postponement to outweigh their inefficiency. 

We should in fact have a situation in which short processes would have to be kept sufficiently scarce for their physical efficiency to outweigh the disadvantage of the early delivery of their product. A correct theory, therefore, must be reversible so as to be able to cover the cases of the marginal efficiency of capital corresponding either to a positive or to a negative rate of interest; and it is, I think, only the scarcity theory outlined above which is capable of this. 

Moreover there are all sorts of reasons why various kinds of services and facilities are scarce and therefore expensive relatively to the quantity of labour involved. For example, smelly processes command a higher reward, because people will not undertake them otherwise. 

So do risky processes. But we do not devise a productivity theory of smelly or risky processes as such. In short, not all labour is accomplished in equally agreeable attendant circumstances; and conditions of equilibrium require that articles produced in less agreeable attendant circumstances (characterised by smelliness, risk or the lapse of time) must be kept sufficiently scarce to command a higher price. 

But if the lapse of time becomes an agreeable attendant circumstance, which is a quite possible case and already holds for many individuals, then, as I have said above, it is the short processes which must be kept sufficiently scarce. Given the optimum amount of roundaboutness, we shall, of course, select the most efficient roundabout processes which we can find up to the required aggregate. But the optimum amount itself should be such as to provide at the appropriate dates for that part of consumers’ demand which it is desired to defer. In optimum conditions, that is to say, production should be so organised as to produce in the most efficient manner compatible with delivery at the dates at which consumers’ demand is expected to become effective. 

It is no use to produce for delivery at a different date from this, even though the physical output could be increased by changing the date of delivery; — except in so far as the prospect of a larger meal, so to speak, induces the consumer to anticipate or postpone the hour of dinner. 

If, after hearing full particulars of the meals he can get by fixing dinner at different hours, the consumer is expected to decide in favour of 8 o'clock, it is the business of the cook to provide the best dinner he can for service at that hour, irrespective of whether 7.30, 8 o'clock or 8.30 is the hour which would suit him best if time counted for nothing, one way or the other, and his only task was to produce the absolutely best dinner. In some phases of society it may be that we could get physically better dinners by dining later than we do; but it is equally conceivable in other phases that we could get better dinners by dining earlier. My theory is applicable to both contingencies. 

If the interest rate were zero, there would be an optimum interval for any given article between the average date of input and the date of consumption, for which labour cost would be a minimum; — a shorter process of production would be less efficient technically, whilst a longer process would also be less efficient by reason of storage costs and deterioration. 

If the interest rate exceeds zero, a new element of cost is introduced which increases with the length of the process, so that the optimum interval will be shortened, and the current input to provide for the eventual delivery of the article will have to be curtailed until the prospective price has increased sufficiently to cover the increased cost — a cost which will be increased both by the interest charges and also by the diminished efficiency of the shorter method of production. 

If the rate of interest falls below zero (assuming this to be technically possible), the opposite is the case. Given the prospective consumers’ demand, current input to-day has to compete, so to speak, with the alternative of starting input at a later date; and, consequently, current input will only be worth while when the greater cheapness, by reason of greater technical efficiency or prospective price changes, of producing later on rather than now, is insufficient to offset the smaller return from negative interest. 

In the case of the great majority of articles, it would involve great technical inefficiency to start up their input more than a very modest length of time ahead of their prospective consumption. 

Thus, even if the rate of interest is zero, there is a strict limit to the proportion of prospective consumers’ demand which it is profitable to begin providing for in advance; and, as the rate of interest rises, the proportion of the prospective consumers’ demand for which it pays to produce to-day shrinks pari passu.  -->
