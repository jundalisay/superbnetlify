Capital has to be kept scarce enough in the long term to have a marginal efficiency at least equal to the interest rate for a period equal to the life of the capital<!-- , as determined by psychological and institutional conditions -->. 

A wealthy society with so much capital has its marginal efficiency at zero. 
- It would be negative with any additional investment. 
- Yet it will have a monetary system that has negligible costs of storage and safe custody. 
- This will lead to interest rates not being negative.
- This will, at full employment, will make the people save. 

Entrepreneurs will necessarily make losses if they continue to offer employment on a scale which will use the whole stock of capital.

The stock of capital and employment will thus shrink until the society becomes so impoverished as to reduce the aggregate of saving to zero. <!-- , the positive saving of some individuals or groups being offset by the negative saving of others.  -->

Thus equilibrium, under laissez-faire, will be one where employment is low enough and the standard of life sufficiently miserable to bring savings to zero. 

<!-- More probably there will be a cyclical movement round this equilibrium position. For if there is still room for uncertainty about the future, the marginal efficiency of capital will occasionally rise above zero leading to a “boom”, and in the succeeding “slump” the stock of capital may fall for a time below the level which will yield a marginal efficiency of zero in the long run. Assuming correct foresight, the equilibrium stock of capital which will have a marginal efficiency of precisely zero will, of course, be a smaller stock than would correspond to full employment of the available labour; for it will be the equipment which corresponds to that proportion of unemployment which ensures zero saving.  -->

The only alternative position of equilibrium is to have a stock of capital sufficiently great to have a marginal efficiency of zero. 
- This means that wealth <!-- represents an amount of wealth sufficiently great to --> is available to satiate the aggregate desire to save and invest <!--  on the part of the public to make provision for the future, --> even with full employment, in times when no interest revenue is obtainable.

But it is unlikely that the propensity to save under full employment becomes satisfied just at the point where capital reaches the level where its marginal efficiency is zero. 
- If <!-- , therefore, this more favourable possibility comes to the rescue, --> this happens, it will probably take effect <!-- , not just at the point --> when the interest rate is vanishing and <!-- , but at some previous point --> during the gradual decline of interest rate*.


> *Superphysics Note: The failure of QE from 2009 blows this argument out of existence. Keynes' flaw is that he assumes that investments will just happen even at low interest rates because he forgets about profit maximization.

Thus, institutionally, the interest rate cannot be negative since money has negligible carrying costs.

In fact, however, institutional and psychological factors set a limit much above zero to the practicable decline in interest rates. 

In particular, the costs of bringing borrowers and lenders together and uncertainty as to the future interest rates will set a lower limit as high as 2% or 2.5% on long term. 

If this proves correct, the awkward possibilities of an increasing stock of wealth, when the interest rate is at bottom, <!--  can fall no further under laissez-faire, --> may soon become real. At this point, the aggregate desire to accumulate wealth will not likely be satiated before the interest rate has reached its minimum level.

<!-- realised in actual experience. Moreover if the minimum level to which it is practicable to bring the rate of interest is appreciably above zero, there is less likelihood of  -->

The post-war UK and US experiences had an accumulation of wealth so large that its marginal efficiency fell more rapidly than the interest rate can fall under laissez faire. <!--  in the face of the prevailing institutional and psychological factors --> This accumulation interfered with employment and the standard of life.<!--  which the technical conditions of production are capable of furnishing.  -->

It follows that the poorer society can enjoy a <!--  of two equal communities, having the same technique but different stocks of capital, the community with the smaller stock of capital may be able for the time being to enjoy --> higher standard of life than a wealthier one. The poorer society will then have the same problem after it becomes rich, under laissez faire where the propensity to consume and the rate of investment are not deliberately controlled in the social interest.

Under full employment, the interest rate cannot fall as fast as the fall of the marginal efficiency of capital and the savings at that interest rate.  <!-- would fall with a rate of accumulation corresponding to what the community would choose to save at a rate of interest equal to the marginal efficiency of capital -->

This means that even a diversion of the desire to hoard zero yield assets* will increase economic well-being.

Millionaires find their satisfaction in building mighty mansions. Digging holes in the ground* paid by savings will increase employment and the real national dividend of useful goods and services.

Let us assume that:
- the interest rate is made consistent with the rate of investment of full employment
- State action balances to provide growth of capital equipment is saturated without burdening the standard of life of the present generation

<!-- On such assumptions I should guess that a properly run community equipped with modern technical resources, of which the population is not increasing rapidly, ought to be able to -->

This should bring down the marginal efficiency of capital in equilibrium approximately to zero within a single generation. <!-- ; so that we should attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and  --> Progress would then result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions. <!-- , with the products of capital selling at a price proportioned to the labour, etc., embodied in them on just the same principles as govern the prices of consumption-goods into which capital-charges enter in an insignificant degree. -->

If I am right in imagining it to be easy to make capital-goods so abundant that the marginal efficiency of capital is zero, this would be the most sensible way of gradually getting rid of many of the objectionable features of capitalism*.

For a little reflection will show what enormous social changes would result from a gradual disappearance of a rate of return on accumulated wealth.

A man would still be free to accumulate his earned income for spending it later. But his accumulation would not grow. 

<!-- He would simply be in the position of Pope’s father, who, when he retired from business, carried a chest of guineas with him to his villa at Twickenham and met his household expenses from it as required.  -->

The rentier would disappear. There would still be room for enterprise and skill*.

<!--  in the estimation of prospective yields about which opinions could differ. For the above relates primarily to the pure rate of interest apart from any allowance for risk and the like, and not to the gross yield of assets including the return in respect of risk. Thus unless the pure rate of interest were to be held at a negative figure, there would still be a positive yield to skilled investment in individual assets having a doubtful prospective yield. Provided there was some measurable unwillingness to undertake risk, there would also be a positive net yield from the aggregate of such assets over a period of time. But it is not unlikely that, in such circumstances, the eagerness to obtain a yield from doubtful investments might be such that they would show in the aggregate a negative net yield. -->
