We keep <!-- In emphasising our point of departure from the classical system, we must not overlook an important point of agreement. For we shall maintain --> the first Classical postulate that Wage is equal to the marginal product of labour.<!--  as heretofore, subject only to the same qualifications as in the classical theory; and we must pause, for a moment, to consider what this involves. -->

<!-- It means that, with a given organisation, equipment and technique,  -->

Real wages and the volume of output (and hence of employment) are uniquely correlated. 

Employment can only increase through a decline in the rate of real wages. 

<!-- Thus I am not disputing this vital fact which the classical economists have (rightly) asserted as indefeasible.  In a given state of organisation, equipment and technique,--> 

Industry is subject to decreasing returns in the short period, while capital is constant.

The real wage earned by a <!-- worker --> unit of labour has a unique inverse correlation with the volume of employment.
- **If employment increases in a short time, the reward per unit of labour in terms of wage-goods declines and profits increase.** *
- The marginal product in the wage-good industries (which governs real wages) necessarily diminishes as employment is increased. 

> `n` men are employed. The nth man adds 1 bushel a day to the harvest. Wages have a buying power of 1 bushel a day. The `n + 1th` man, however, would only add .9 bushel a day. In this case, employment cannot rise to `n + 1` men unless the price of wheat rises relatively to wages until all daily wages have a buying power of .9 bushel [to match the previous 0.9]. Aggregate wages would then amount to 0.9 (n + 1) bushels as compared with n bushels previously. Thus, the employment of an additional man will involve a transfer of income from those previously in work to the entrepreneurs [This is wrong. The extra man will still be paid the same 1 bushel. It will be a loss to the entrepreneur].

<!-- This is simply the obverse of the familiar proposition that  Industry is subject to decreasing returns in the short period, while capital is constant.-->

As long as this proposition holds, increased employment also reduces:
- the marginal product and
- the wages measured in terms of this product.

But we deleted the second postulate which says that a decline in employment <!-- , although necessarily associated with labour’s receiving a wage equal in value to a larger quantity of wage-goods, --> is <!-- not necessarily --> due to workers demanding more wage-goods.

Reducing money-wages is not necessarily a remedy for unemployment. <!-- The theory of wages in relation to employment is fully explained in Chapter 19 and its Appendix. -->


From the time of Say and Ricardo, the classical economists have taught that supply creates its own demand. 
- All the costs of production must necessarily be spent in the aggregate on buying the product.

J. S. Mill’s Principles of Political Economy explains this doctrine:

{{< q a="mill" >}}
The means of payment for commodities is simply commodities. Each person pays for the productions of other people with his own. All sellers are inevitably buyers. 

If we could suddenly double the country's productivity, we would double the supply of commodities in every market. We would also double the purchasing power. Everybody would bring a double demand as well as supply. Everybody would be able to buy twice as much, because every one would have twice as much to offer in exchange. 
<cite>Principles of Political Economy, Book 3, Chapter 14</cite>
{{< /q >}}


Any individual act of abstaining from consumption causes the labour and commodities to be diverted from supplying consumption into the investment in the production of capital wealth. 

Marshall’s Pure Theory of Domestic Values[9] illustrates the traditional approach:

{{< q a="marshall" >}}
The whole of a man’s income is expended in the purchase of services and of commodities. A man spends some portion of his income and saves another. 

But it is a familiar economic axiom that a man purchases labour and commodities with that portion of his income which he saves just as much as he does with that he is said to spend. He spends when he seeks to obtain present enjoyment from the services and commodities which he purchases. He saves when he causes the labour and the commodities which he purchases to be devoted to the production of wealth from which he expects to derive the means of enjoyment in the future.
{{< /q >}}


It is not easy to compare Marshall’s later work[10] with Edgeworth or Pigou. 

The doctrine is never stated today in this crude form. Nevertheless it still underlies the whole classical theory, which would collapse without it. 

Contemporary economists accept Mill's conclusions which require Mill’s doctrine as their premise. 

Pigou believes:
- that money makes no real difference except frictionally and
- that the theory of production and employment can be worked out (like Mill’s) as being based on ‘real’ exchanges with money introduced perfunctorily in a later chapter, is the modern version of the classical tradition. 

Contemporary thought is still deeply steeped in the notion that if people do not spend their money in one way they will spend it in another.[11] Post-war economists seldom succeed in maintaining this standpoint consistently*.


> *Superphysics Note: This is due to growth in the doctrine of profit maximization which did not exist during the time of Mill or Ricardo 

<!-- Their thought today is too much permeated with the contrary tendency and with facts of experience too obviously inconsistent with their former view.[12] But they have not drawn sufficiently far-reaching consequences; and have not revised their fundamental theory. -->

<!-- In the first instance, these conclusions may have been applied to the kind of economy in which we actually live by false analogy from some kind of non-exchange Robinson Crusoe economy, in which the income which individuals consume or retain as a result of their productive activity is, actually and exclusively, the output in specie of that activity.  -->

<!-- But, apart from this, t -->

The Classical conclusion is that the costs of output are always covered in the aggregate by the sale-proceeds resulting from demand. 

Another Classical idea is that income derived in the aggregate by all the elements in society concerned in a productive activity necessarily has a value exactly equal to the value of the output.

The first conclusion has great plausibility because it is difficult to distinguish it from the latter idea. <!-- , similar-looking proposition which is indubitable, namely that income derived in the aggregate by all the elements in the community concerned in a productive activity necessarily has a value exactly equal to the value of the output. -->

Similarly, it is natural to suppose that a man who enriches himself, without taking anything from anyone else, must also enrich the community as a whole. In this way, an act of individual saving inevitably leads to a parallel act of investment*. 

<!-- For, once more, it is indubitable that the sum of the net increments of the wealth of individuals must be exactly equal to the aggregate net increment of the wealth of the community. -->

> *Superphysics Note: Yes, because there is no profit maximization to hinder investments at low profits


<!-- Those who think in this way are deceived, nevertheless, by an optical illusion, which makes two essentially different activities appear to be the same. They are fallaciously supposing that there is a nexus which unites decisions to abstain from present consumption with decisions to provide for future consumption; whereas the motives which determine the latter are not linked in any simple way with the motives which determine the former.

It is, then, the assumption of equality between the demand price of output as a whole and its supply price which is to be regarded as the classical theory’s ‘axiom of parallels’. Granted this, all the rest follows — the social advantages of private and national thrift, the traditional attitude towards the rate of interest, the classical theory of unemployment, the quantity theory of money, the unqualified advantages of laissez-faire in respect of foreign trade and much else which we shall have to question.
 -->


The assumptions of classical theory are:

1. The real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of the existing employment [workers not working]

2. There is no such thing as involuntary unemployment

3. Supply creates its own demand in the sense that the aggregate demand price is equal to the aggregate supply price for all levels of output and employment

These <!-- three assumptions, however, all amount to the same thing in the sense that they all --> stand and fall together*<!-- , any one of them logically involving the other two -->.


> *Superphysics Note: Yes they fall if you convert real value (based on goods) into nominal value (based on cash and money). That would then lead to a gambling or speculative economy which is totally arbitrary. 



<!-- ### Author’s Footnotes

1. Ricardo expressly repudiated any interest in the amount of the national dividend, as distinct from its distribution. But his successors, were less clear-sighted. They used the classical theory in discussions concerning the causes of wealth. Vide Ricardo’s letter to Malthus of October 9, 1820= “Political Economy you think is an enquiry into the nature and causes of wealth — I think it should be called an enquiry into the laws which determine the division of the produce of industry amongst the classes who concur in its formation. No law can be laid down respecting quantity, but a tolerably correct one can be laid down respecting proportions. Every day I am more satisfied that the former enquiry is vain and delusive, and the latter only the true objects of the science.”

2. Pigou in the Economics of Welfare (4th ed. p. 127) writes (my italics)= “Throughout this discussion, except when the contrary is expressly stated, the fact that some resources are generally unemployed against the will of the owners is ignored. This does not affect the substance of the argument, while it simplifies its exposition.”. Thus, whilst Ricardo expressly disclaimed any attempt to deal with the amount of the national dividend as a whole, Prof. Pigou, in a book which is specifically directed to the problem of the national dividend, maintains that the same theory holds when there is some involuntary unemployment as in the case of full employment.

3. Prof. Pigou’s Theory of Unemployment is examined in more detail in the Appendix to Chapter 19 below.

4. Cf. the quotation from Prof. Pigou above, p. 5, footnote.

5. This point is dealt with in detail in the Appendix to Chapter 19 below.

6. This argument would, indeed, contain, to my thinking, a large element of truth, though the complete results of a change in money-wages are more complex, as we shall show in Chapter 19 below.

7. Cf. Chapter 19, Appendix.


9. p. 34.

10. Mr. J. A. Hobson, after quoting in his Physiology of Industry (p. 102) the above passage from Mill, points out that Marshall commented as follows on this passage as early as his Economics of Industry, p. 154. “But though men have the power to purchase, they may not choose to use it.” “But”, Mr Hobson continues, “he fails to grasp the critical importance of this fact, and appears to limit its action to periods of ‘crisis’.” This has remained fair comment, I think, in the light of Marshall’s later work.

11. Cf. Alfred and Mary Marshall, Economics of Industry, p. 17= “It is not good for trade to have dresses made of material which wears out quickly. For if people did not spend their means on buying new dresses they would spend them on giving employment to labour in some other way.” The reader will notice that I am again quoting from the earlier Marshall. The Marshall of the Principles had become sufficiently doubtful to be very cautious and evasive. But the old ideas were never repudiated or rooted out of the basic assumptions of his thought.

12. It is this distinction of Prof. Robbins that he, almost alone, continues to maintain a consistent scheme of thought, his practical recommendations belonging to the same system as his theory. -->
