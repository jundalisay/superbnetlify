'Sense-data' are the things that are immediately known in sensation. Examples are colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on.

'Sensation' is the experience of being immediately aware of these things. 

Thus, whenever we see a colour, we have a sensation of the colour. But the colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. 

The colour is that of which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. 

If we are to know anything about the table, it must be by means of the sense-data—brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness, etc. These we associate with the table.

But we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly properties of the table. 

Thus, a problem arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing there is such a thing.

The real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. 

Thus we have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects. The collection of all physical objects is called 'matter'. Thus our 2 questions may be re-stated as:

1. Is there any such thing as matter?
2. If so, what is its nature?


Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753) first proposed why the immediate objects of our senses as not existing independently of us. 

His Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists, prove that:
- there is no such thing as matter at all, and
- the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas. 

Hylas has believed in matter. But he is no match for Philonous, who mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes his own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common sense. 

The arguments employed are of very different value. Some are important and sound, others are confused or quibbling. 

But Berkeley has shown that:
- the existence of matter can be denied without absurdity, and 
- if there are any things that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate objects of our sensations.

<!-- There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists, and it is important to keep them clear.  -->

We commonly mean by 'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind'. It is something which we think of as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought or consciousness. 

It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies matter. He believes that the sense-data from the existence of the table are really signs of the existence of something independent of us. But he denies that this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas entertained by some mind. 

He admits that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing in something which persists even when we are not seeing it.

But he thinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from what we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it must be independent of our seeing. 

He is thus led to regard the 'real' table as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required permanence and independence of ourselves, without being—as matter would otherwise be—something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only infer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.

Other philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the table does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by some mind—not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole collective mind of the universe.

This they hold, as Berkeley does, chiefly because they think there can be nothing real—or at any rate nothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings. We might state the argument by which they support their view in some such way as this: 'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist.'

I think that such an argument is fallacious. Those who advance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. 

<!-- But whether valid or not, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another; and very many philosophers, perhaps  -->

A majority of philosophers have held that there is nothing real except minds and their ideas. 

Such philosophers are called 'idealists'. 

They explain matter as either:
- that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas, like Berkeley, or
- that what appears as matter is really a collection of more or less rudimentary minds, like Leibniz (1646-1716).

These philosophers deny matter as opposed to mind. But in another sense, they admit matter. 

<!-- It will be remembered that we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be? Now  -->

Both Berkeley and Leibniz admit that there is a real table. 
- But Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the mind of God.
- Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. 

Thus both of them only diverge from the views of ordinary mortals in their answer to what objects are. 

<!-- In fact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real table: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data—colour, shape, smoothness, etc.—may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is a sign of something existing independently of us, something differing, perhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as causing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the real table.

Now obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed—the view that there is a real table, whatever its nature may be—is vitally important, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are for accepting this view before we go on to the further question as to the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all. -->


<!-- Before we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, -->

We have discovered that:
- If we take any common object that is known by the senses, what the senses immediately tell us is not the truth about the object as it is apart from us.
- Our senses only tells about the truth about certain sense-data which depend on the relations between us and the object.

Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance', which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. 

But if the reality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what it is like?

<!-- Such questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table, which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a problem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we have the most complete liberty of conjecture.  -->

- Leibniz tells us it is a community of souls.
- Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God.
- Sober science tells us it is a vast collection of electric charges in violent motion.

Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all. 

<!-- Philosophy, if it cannot answer so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life. -->
