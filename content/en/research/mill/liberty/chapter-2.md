The liberty of the press is one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government.

<!-- No argument, we may suppose, can now be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to hear. 

This aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not be specially insisted on in this place.  -->

The law of England today on press freedom is as servile as it was in the time of the Tudors. But there is little danger of its being used against political discussion except during insurrection.  <!--  drives ministers and[Pg 29] judges from their propriety;[6] and, speaking generally, it is not, in  --> The governments in constitutional countries do not <!--  to be apprehended that the government, whether completely responsible to the people or not, will --> often attempt to control public expression<!--  of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ of the general intolerance of the public -->.

Let us suppose that the government is entirely at one with the people, but stifles the freedom of the press. 

Such a power is illegitimate. <!-- The best --> A government that silences the opinion of one man silences the opinion of mankind. 

<!-- , and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government.  -->



<!-- no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.  -->

<!-- Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner;  -->

The freedom of opinion might injure many. <!-- if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on[Pg 31] many.  -->But the peculiar evil of silencing an opinion is like robbing the human race, both the present and future generations. <!-- ; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. --> If the opinion is right, the government is deprived of exchanging error for truth. If it is  wrong, they lose <!-- , what is almost as great a benefit, --> the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

<!-- It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still. -->

1. The opinion which tries to suppress by authority might be true

Those suppress it will deny its truth. But those suppressors are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging. <!-- To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common. -->

<!-- Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while  -->

Everyone knows himself to be fallible, but few think it necessary to guard against their own fallibility. <!-- , or admit the supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable.  -->

Absolute princes <!-- , or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, --> usually feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all subjects. <!-- People more happily situated, who sometimes hear their opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they habitually defer= for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in his own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of "the world" in general. --> 


To each person, "the world" is the part of it which he comes in contact with. 

<!-- ; his party, his sect, his church, his class of society= the man may be called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age. Nor is his faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, and even now think, the exact reverse. 
 -->

In his own world, each person is correct <!-- is He devolves on his own world the responsibility of being in the right --> against the dissentient worlds of other people. This is even if:
- these numerous worlds were decided by chance
- the same causes which make him a Churchman in London, would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in China

<!-- It never troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance, and that the . -->

Ages are no more infallible than individuals. Every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd. For example, many general opinions of today will be rejected by future ages, just as we now reject the general opinions of the past.  <!-- as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present. -->


People object to the infallability of modern general opinion by saying that everyone makes mistakes, but it doesn't mean that we should not have any general opinion. It is therefore the duty of governments and individuals to form the truest opinions they can. 

<!-- The objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take some such form as the following. There is no greater assumption of infallibility in forbidding the propagation of[Pg 34] error, than in any other thing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and responsibility. 

Judgment is given to men that they may use it. Because it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to use it at all? --> 

<!-- To prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them, although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. If we were never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong, we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties unperformed. An objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid objection to any conduct in particular.  -->


<!-- ; to form them carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure of being right. But when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scattered abroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightened times, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true. Let us take[Pg 35] care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake= but governments and nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be fit subjects for the exercise of authority= they have laid on bad taxes, made unjust wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under whatever provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must act to the best of their ability. There is no such thing as absolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life. We may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own conduct= and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and pernicious. -->

I answer that there is a huge difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. 

Complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action. On no other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance of being right.

When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other are no worse than they are? 

Not certainly to the inherent force of the human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative; for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things which no one will now justify. 

Why is it, then, that there is on the whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct? 

If there really is this preponderance—which there must be, unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate state—it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience alone. 

There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument= but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it. Very few facts are able to tell their own story, without comments to bring out their meaning. The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct. 

Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious. Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner. 

The steady habit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it[Pg 38] with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it= for, being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his position against all gainsayers—knowing that he has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter—he has a right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process.

<!-- It is not too much to require that what --> The wisest of mankind , those who are best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to warrant their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneous collection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called the public.
