> Superphysics Note: Mill's system of liberty only prevents the violence of despotism. It does not prevent the slavery and oppression from the strong classes that prey on the weak. This manifess nowdays as the oppression from inequality and inflation 


<!-- The grand, leading principle, towards which every argument unfolded in these pages directly converges, is the absolute and essential importance of human development in its richest diversity.—Wilhelm Von Humboldt= Sphere and Duties of Government. -->

This Essay is about Civil or Social Liberty, not about the Liberty of the Will which opposed to the  doctrine of Philosophical Necessity. 

What is the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual? 

This question has <!-- A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far from being new, that in a certain sense, it has --> divided mankind for a long time. <!-- , almost from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more civilised portions of the species have now[Pg 2] entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment. --> The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. 

In old times, this contest was between the people and the government. Liberty meant protection against the tyrannical rulers which were made up of <!-- The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled.  --> a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest. 

<!-- , who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise.  -->

Their power was regarded as:
- necessary but also as highly dangerous
- a weapon which they use against their subjects and external enemies

To prevent the weaker members from being preyed on by vultures, an animal of prey stronger than the rest was needed to keep them down. But a king of the vultures would both prey on the weak and the strong. Thus, everyone had to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against him<!--  beak and claws -->. 

Patriots therefore were needed to set limits to the ruler's power. They called this limitation as "liberty" and was implemented in two ways:

1. Political liberties or rights

A violation of this by the ruler<!--  was not supposed to infringe on these. If he did, --> justified resistance or rebellion.<!--  was justifiable.  The the ruling power in --> Most European rulers were compelled to submit to this.

2. The establishment of constitutional checks

This came from the consent of the community. It represented its interests and was applied on <!-- necessary condition on --> the important acts of the ruler<!--  governing power -->. Most European rulers were not compelled to submit to this. This is why the lovers of liberty strove for this. 

People did not <!-- carry their aspirations -->go beyond this point as long as they were content to:
- combat one enemy by another
- be ruled by a master who would not not oppress them<!-- , on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, . -->

In time, the people felt that <!-- A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that --> their governors should not be independent. Instead, <!-- opposed in interest to themselves.  --> those magistrates should be their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. This would prevent those magistrates from abusing the powers of government. 

The popular party made this new demand for elected, temporary rulers. They made efforts to limit the power of rulers. 

As the struggle proceeded, <!--  for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, --> some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself. Their new demand was for the <!-- That (it might seem) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people. What was now wanted was, that the --> rulers to be identified with the people. **Their interest should be the interest and will of the nation**. 
- The nation did not need to be protected against its own will. 
- There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. 

Let the rulers be subjected <!-- responsible --> to it, <!-- promptly --> removable by it<!-- , and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made -->. Their power was the nation's own power, concentrated, in a  convenient form<!--  for exercise -->. 

This feeling was common among the last generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section* where it still predominates. 

> *Superphysics Note= The French Revolution


The Continental political thinkers had brilliant exceptions who thought that there should be limits to government. <!-- Those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out as  among . --> This feeling might have been prevalent in our Britain by now if it were encouraged unaltered. But <!-- , in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, --> the success of the French Revolution exposed its <!-- discloses --> own faults and infirmities which were hidden in from the theory.  <!-- failure might have concealed from observation. --> 

The idea that the people should have unlimited power over themselves seems axiomatic when popular government was still not a reality. <!-- a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of  --> The French Revolution allowed <!-- , the worst of which were the work of --> a usurping few <!-- , and which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular institutions, but to a --> to suddenly and convulsively break out against monarchical and aristocratic despotism. 

In time, however, most countries became democratic republics. <!--  came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations; and --> Elected and responsible governments became subject to the observations and criticisms.  <!-- which wait upon a great existing fact. --> <!-- It was now perceived that such phrases as  -->


### Self-Government Doesn't Work

"Self-government" and "the power of the people over themselves" are not real. <!-- do not express the true state of the case. --> The "people" who exercise the power are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised. "Self-government" is not the government of each by himself, **but of each by all the rest**. 

The will of the people really means the will of the most numerous or the most active, as the majority. <!-- , or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority= --> The people, consequently, might oppress a part of them. Precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power. 

The limitation of <!-- the power of --> government over individuals is not so useful when that government is <!-- , loses none of its importance when the holders of power are --> regularly accountable to the <!-- community, that is, to the --> strongest party in society<!--  therein -->. This view appeals to both thinkers and the ruling class. <!-- of things, recommending itself equally to the intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself.  -->

"The tyranny of the majority" is now among the evils which society has to guard against. Like other tyrannies, this tyranny was first dreaded. <!--  of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread. It chiefly operates through the acts of the public authorities.  --> But <!-- reflecting persons --> people perceived that when society is itself is tyrannical, <!-- the tyrant—society collectively, over the separate individuals who compose it—its means of tyrannising are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries.  --> it can <!-- Society can and does execute its own mandates. It --> practise social tyranny through:
- issuing the wrong mandates, or
- mandating everything   <!-- more formidable than many kinds of political oppression -->. 

This leads to extreme penalties which penetrates much more deeply into the details of life<!-- , and enslaving the soul itself -->. 

Protection against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough. There should also be protection against the tyranny of:
- the prevailing opinion and feeling, and
- the tendency of society to impose its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent 

Such tyranny= 
- prevents the development of any individuality not in harmony with its ways*, and 
- compels all characters to fashion themselves on the model of its own

> *Superphysics Note= Liberalism is naturally adharmic or non-harmonious because it lets people to refuse to be in line with the harmony of society 


<!-- There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence
= and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to  -->

A good condition of human affairs must be maintained as protection against political despotism. But how do we the limit and make the fitting adjustments between individual independence and social control?

<!-- —is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. --> 

## The Moral Rules of JS Mill

Some rules of conduct must be imposed by law*. For subjects not fit for the law, the rules are set by opinion. <!-- What these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which least progress has been made in resolving.  --> No two ages, and scarcely any two countries, have decided those rules alike. <!-- ; and the decision of one age or country is a wonder to another. Yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed.  -->

<!-- The rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is continually mistaken for the first.  -->

> *Superphysics Note= Without any foundation in Metaphysics, JS Mill's Liberalism ends up being a casuistic system similar to Islam, except that it goes in the opposite direction towards the ego instead of the Supreme.  



These rules are the effect of custom. <!-- , in preventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself.  --> People are accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged to believe by <!--  by some who aspire to the character of --> philosophers, that their feelings, on subjects of this nature, are better than reasons<!-- , and render reasons unnecessary -->. 


### Social Rules are Based on Ego or Personal Preference

The practical principle which guides morality <!-- them to their opinions on the regulation of human conduct, --> is the feeling <!-- in each person's mind --> that everybody should <!-- be required to --> act as he, and those with whom he sympathises, would like them to act. 

Morality is therefore a personal preference.  <!-- No one acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking, But an opinion on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one person's preference.  --> If this preference <!--  reasons are a mere appeal to a --> is similar to that felt by other people, then it is a general <!--  it is still only many people's --> preference instead of a personal preference. 

To an ordinary man, his personal <!-- own preference --> preference is perfectly satisfactory<!--  reason -->. It is generally his only basis for any of his notions of morality, taste, or propriety. <!-- , which are not expressly written in his religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that.  -->

Therefore, men's opinions are <!-- , accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, --> are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others<!-- , and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject -->. 

These causes are:
- their reason
- their prejudices or superstitions
- their social or anti-social affections
- their envy or jealousy
- their arrogance or contemptuousness
- commonly their desires or fears for themselves, as their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest

Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the country's morality emanates from the interests and  feelings of superiority of this class.

The morality between the following have been mostly the creation of these class interests and feelings= 
- the Spartans and Helots
- planters and negroes
- princes and subjects
- nobles and roturiers
- men and women

<!-- and the sentiments thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves.  -->

On the other hand, the feelings of formerly ascendant class <!--  , has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an --> dislike the superiority of the ascendant class. 


### Social Rules are Based on Servility

Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct is <!-- , both in act and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been --> the servility of mankind towards <!-- the preferences or aversions of --> their temporal masters or their gods. 

This servility, though essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy. It leads to perfectly genuine hatred. It made men burn magicians and heretics. 

Among so many baser influences, the general and obvious interests of society is a large one. It has a large share in moral feelings. <!--  have of course had a share, and a large one, in the direction of the moral sentiments --><!-- = less, however, as a matter of reason, and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out of them= and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great force. --> The likings and dislikings of society thus has <!-- , or of some powerful portion of it, are thus the main thing which has practically --> determined the rules which are laid down<!--  for general observance, under the penalties[Pg 13] of law or opinion -->. 

Those who <!-- And in general, those who --> have advanced the interest of society <!--  in thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in principle, however they may --> have come into conflict with it in some of its details. They instead ask what things society should like or dislike, than in asking whether its likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals. 

They preferred changing the feelings of mankind <!-- on the particular points on which they were themselves heretical, --> rather than defend freedom<!-- , with heretics generally -->. They are only consistent with <!-- only case in which the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of --> religious belief. Religion is proof of the  <!-- = a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as forming --> <!-- a most striking instance of the --> fallibility of <!-- what is called --> the moral sense. The odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. 


<!-- Those who first broke the yoke of the Universal Church, were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself. 

But when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a complete victory to any party, and each church or[Pg 14] sect was reduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they could not convert, for permission to differ. 

It is accordingly on this battle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted. The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religious belief.  -->

<!-- Yet so natural to mankind is -->

<!-- People have a natural intolerance in whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference, which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has added its weight to the scale.  -->

<!-- In the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerant countries,  -->

The religious admit the duty of toleration with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in matters of church government, but not of dogma. <!-- ; another can tolerate everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitarian; another, every one who believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed. -->

<!-- In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history, though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter, than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the public. 

The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government their power, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so, individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it;[Pg 16] and this with very little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particular instances of its application. There is, in fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is customarily tested. People decide according to their personal preferences. 

Some, whenever they see any good to be done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human interests amenable to governmental control.

Men range themselves on one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere, as to what things are fit to be done by a government. And it seems to me that in[Pg 17] consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly condemned. -->


### Non-Harm as the Basis for Liberty, Implementable only in Civilized Nations

This Essay aims to assert that the very simple principle of self-protection can allow the interfering with the liberty of action of mankind. Power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, in order to prevent harm to others.

His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.

<!-- as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. 

This is the sole end of mankind individually or collectively.  in  of any of their number, is .  --> 

<!-- He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with[Pg 18] any evil in case he do otherwise. 

To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. -->

This doctrine applies only to mature human beings and not to children or teenagers. <!--   young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to --> They need to be cared for by others and must be protected against their own actions and external injury. 

This doctrine also does not apply <!-- For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those --> to backward societies. <!-- in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. -->  Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided:
- the end be their improvement and
- the means are justified by actually effecting that end. 

**Liberty can only be applied to <!-- , as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind --> people who have can be improved by free and equal discussion.**  Until such a long period has passed to allow that, they should be obedient to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon as people can be guided to their own improvement by conviction, persuasion, or  compulsion, either directly or directly as legal pains and penalties for non-compliance, then despotism is no longer admissible.<!--  as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others. -->

<!-- (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves),  -->


### Utility is Not the Basis of Liberty

<!-- It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent of utility.  -->

Utility, in the general sense, is the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions. <!--  but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being. --> This utility is based on private interest which can be controlled externally if it affects the private interests of others. 

<!-- Those interests, I contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control, only in respect to[Pg 20] those actions of each, which concern the interest of other people.  -->

If anyone hurts others, then he can be <!--  there is a primâ facie case for --> punished by law or <!-- , where legal penalties are not safely applicable, by --> general disapprobation. 

He could also be compelled to do positive acts that will benefit others such as:
- giving evidence in a court of justice
- help with the common defence or any social work
- doing beneficent acts such as saving a life or protecting the defenceless

We have a duty to do these things. But these can be forced on him. <!-- These things a  man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing. --> A person might cause evil to others by both his actions and his inaction. <!-- , and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury. The latter case, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former.  -->

My rule is to make any one answerable for doing evil to others. The exception to my rule is to make him answerable for not preventing evil. <!-- , is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception. -->

Generally a person has a duty to protect society. But sometimes he can be exempt from this responsibility. An example is when he can help society better in his own way instead of forcing him to help which might cause greater evils.  How to help society is up to each person's conscience. 

<!-- In all things which regard the external relations of the individual, he is de jure amenable to those whose interests are concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector. There are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case= either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than those which it would prevent.  -->



<!-- When such reasons as these preclude the enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures. -->

<!-- But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects only himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation. 

When I say only himself, I mean directly, and in the first instance= for whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself; and the objection which may be grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel. This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty.  -->

<!-- It comprises, first

the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological.  -->


Human liberty requires the following:

1. The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions

This might seem to be a different principle, since it belongs to individual conduct which concerns other people. But since it is as important as the liberty of thought itself, then it is <!-- , and resting in great part on the same reasons, is --> practically inseparable from it. 

2. The liberty of tastes and pursuits

The framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow= without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. 

3. The liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals for any purpose not involving harm to others

This comes from liberty of each individual. The persons combining are supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived.

A society is not free if it does not have all these liberties. 

<!-- ; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of  -->

Freedom means pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.

This doctrine is not new. 

<!-- , and, to some persons, may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice. Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as of social excellence.  -->

The regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority was practiced by the ancient commonwealths and supported by the ancient philosophers. They based it on the fact that the State had a deep interest in the bodily and mental discipline of its citizens. This mode of thinking is admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies. <!-- , in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom.  -->

In the modern world, the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the details of private life. 

But the engines of moral repression have been wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit of Puritanism. 

Some of those modern reformers who have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past, have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right of spiritual domination. 

Mr. Comte wrote about his social system in his *Traité de Politique Positive*. It aims to establish, through moral ways, a despotism of society over the individual. <!-- , surpassing anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers. -->

<!-- Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in the world at large an  to stretch unduly  -->

The world has an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by:
- the force of opinion
- the force of legislation

This <!--  and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to --> strengthens the power of society and diminishes that of the individual. This encroachment is an evil which will grow more and more formidable.<!--   not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to .  -->

The disposition, whether by rulers or fellow-citizens, to impose their own inclinations as a rule of conduct is so energetically supported by the best and worst feelings in human nature. <!-- It will hardly ever be kept under restraint by anything but the lack of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase. -->

<!-- It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a single branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not fully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions.  -->

I focus on a single thesis as <!-- This one branch is --> the Liberty of Thought. <!-- = from which it is impossible to separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing. Although these liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might have been expected.  -->

<!-- Those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the best introduction to the remainder.  -->

<!-- Those to whom nothing which I am about to say will be new, may therefore, I hope, excuse me, if on a subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, I venture on one discussion more.
 -->
