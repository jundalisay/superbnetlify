Those are the reasons why humans should be free to:
- form opinions
- express their opinions without reserve

<!--  and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, or asserted in spite of prohibition;  -->

But should humans be also free to act them out? 

<!-- let us next examine whether the same reasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their opinionsâ€”to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either physical or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own risk and peril.  -->

<!-- This last proviso is of course indispensable.  -->

Actions should not be as free as opinions.

On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act. 

There might be opinions:
- that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor
- that private property is robbery

{{< c c="red" >}}
These opinions should be allowed to freely circulate through the press. But these can be punished when:
<ul>
	<li>delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or</li>
	<li>when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard.</li>	
</ul> 
{{< /c >}}



Acts without justifiable cause that do harm to others might come from <!-- , may be, and in the more important cases absolutely require to be, controlled by --> the unfavourable sentiments*. These need the <!-- , and, when needful, by the --> active interference of mankind. 



> *Superphysics note: Mill promotes the free circulation of hurtful ideas not knowing that those hurtful ideas lead to hurtful actions that he is against. So in effect, he is promoting something that he doesn't like.  


Thus, the liberty of the individual must be limited. He must not make himself a nuisance to other people. 

But this contradicts the rule of letting opinions be free. 

<!-- But if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, --> <!-- and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, --> <!-- then same reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost.  -->

<!-- That mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not[Pg 105] desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognising all sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action, not less than to their opinions. -->

The imperfection of mankind leads to the need for different opinions. This means that there should be different experiments of living. {{< color color="red" val="Free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others. The worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them.*" >}}

## Individuality

Individuality should assert itself in things which do not primarily concern others. 

This individuality will add happiness when the traditions or customs are insufficient in providing it. This happiness will lead to social progress. 

<!-- Where, not the person's own character, but --> 
<!-- there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress. -->

<!-- In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end, but in  -->

The greatest difficulty with this principle is the indifference of persons to the end itself. 


<!-- free development of  is ; that it is not only a co-ordinate element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation, instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things.  -->

Liberty would not be undervalued if individuality were enshrined as one of the leading essentials of well-being. {{< color color="red" val="It would make the adjustment of the boundaries between individuality and social control easier*." >}}


> *Superphysics Note: This is disproven by the high incidence of mass shootings and race riots in the US




### Spontaniety

But the evil is that individual spontaneity is not seen as having any value. <!-- hardly recognised by the common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account -->

The majority are satisfied with the ways as they now are. <!--  (for it is they who make them what they are). They cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody. --> Spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reformers. It is is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and rebellious obstruction to what would be best for mankind. 

<!--  to the general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think .  -->

Wilhelm von Humboldt of Germany was an eminent as a savant and a politician. He wrote that:

{{< quote >}}
"the goal of man is to develop his powers to a complete and consistent whole in the highest and most harmonious way. Thus everyone must focus on the individuality of power and development. Freedom and a a variety of situations are needed for this, which will then lead to individual vigour and manifold diversity which combine themselves in "originality"
{{< /quote >}}11


Few people know Von Humboldt's doctrine. Few put so high a value to individuality. 

Excellence cannot be achieved by doing absolutely nothing but copying one another. <!-- No one would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own judgment, or of their own individual character.  -->

On the other hand, it would be absurd if people neglected the knowledge of others. <!-- to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another.  --> <!-- Nobody denies that people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit by the ascertained results of human experience.  --> However, humans should <!-- But it is the privilege and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to --> use and interpret experience in his own way upon reaching maturity. <!-- It is for him to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstances and character.  -->

The traditions and customs of other people are based on their own experience. But this has problems: <!-- , to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught them; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference: -->

1. Their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have interpreted it rightly. 

2. Their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him. 

Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters. His circumstances or his character might be uncustomary. 

3. Conform to good customs might not educate or develop his individuality


The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and moral preference, are exercised only by making choices. 

When you follow a custom, you make no choice. You do not practice discernment. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used. 

<!-- The faculties are called into no exercise by doing a thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing only because others believe it. If the grounds of an opinion are not conclusive to the person's own reason, his reason cannot be strengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it and if the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own feelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, are not concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic. -->

<!-- He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to[Pg 110] gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision.  -->

<!-- These qualities he requires and exercises exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm's way, without any of these things. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being?  -->


What men do and how they do it are important. <!-- Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself.  --> If houses were built, corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and prayers said by machines, then humans will be starved of human development. 

<!--  it would be a considerable loss to exchange for these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit the more civilised parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starved specimens of what nature can and will produce.  -->

Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it. Instead, it is a tree which requires development on all sides<!-- , according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing -->.

An understanding of customs is better than a blind belief in custom. 

People should exercise their understandings. An intelligent following of custom, or even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a blind mechanical adhesion to it. 

<!-- To a certain extent it is admitted, that our understanding should be our own=  -->

People do not readily admit that their desires and impulses are their own. <!--  likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any strength, is anything but a peril and a snare.  -->

Yet a perfect human being also has desires and impulses just as he has beliefs and restraints. Strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced, <!-- ; when one set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, while others, which should co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive.  -->

It is not because men's desires are strong that they act bad. Iit is because their consciences are weak. 

{{< color color="red" val="There is no natural connection between strong impulses and a weak conscience.  The natural connection is the other way.*" >}}


> *Superphysics Note: Here, Mill shows his ignorance of the concept of the ego being the effect of the Negative Force.


Person A's feelings are stronger and more various than those of Person B. He:
- has more of the raw material of human nature
- is capable of more evil or more good. 

Strong impulses are but another name for energy. 

Energy may be turned to bad uses. But more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent one. <!-- Those who have most natural feeling, are always those whose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest.  -->

The same energy which makes personal impulses vivid and powerful, are also the source of virtue and <!--  from whence are generated the most passionate love of virtue, and the sternest --> self-control. 

It is through the cultivation of this personal power that society both does its duty and protects its interests: not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows not how to make them. 

A person has character if his desires and impulses are his own-- the expression of his own nature. <!-- , as it has been developed and modified by his own cultureâ€”is said to have a .  -->

One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character. He is like a steam-engine that has a character. <!-- If, in addition to being his own, his impulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, he has an energetic character.  -->

Those who reject the encouragement of individuality of desires and impulses imply that society has no need of strong natures. <!-- â€”is not the better for containing many persons who have much characterâ€”and that a high general average of energy is not desirable. -->

In some early states of society, these strong forces might were too much ahead of the governors of society. Spontaneity and individuality was then in excess. The social principle had a hard struggle with it. 

The difficulty then was, to induce men of strong bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to control their impulses. 

To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline, like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power over the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his characterâ€”which society had not found any other sufficient means of binding. 

{{< color color="red" val="But society has now fairly got the better of individuality. Its danger on human nature is the deficiency of personal impulses, not the excess." >}}

<!-- Things are vastly changed, since the passions of those who were strong by station or by personal endowment[Pg 114] were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security.  -->

In our times, everyone lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. <!-- Not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual, or the family, -->

The people do not ask themselves:
- what do I prefer?
- what would suit my character and disposition?
- what would allow the best in me to have fair-play and enable it to grow and thrive?

They ask themselves:
- what is suitable to my position?
- what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances?
- (worse still) what is usually done by persons of circumstances superior to mine? 

I do not mean that they choose custom over their own inclination. I mean that it does not occur to them to incline beyond what is customary. 

Thus, the mind itself is bowed to the yoke. Even when people seek pleasure, they think of conformity first. 

They:
- live in crowds
- exercise choice only among things commonly done 

Peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct are shunned with crimes until by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to follow their human capacities are withered and starved.

They become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own. 

According to the Calvinistic theory, this is desirable. It views:
- Self-will as a great offence of man
- Obedience as the best
- people having no choice

You must do. Whatever is not a duty, is a sin.

<!-- All the good of which humanity is capable, is comprised in .  -->

Human nature is radically corrupt. There is no redemption for any one until human nature is killed within him. 

To one holding this theory of life, crushing out any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no evil= man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the will of God= and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without them.

That is the theory of Calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated form, by many who do not consider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will of God; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer, but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the same for all.

In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of human character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of animals, than as nature made them. 

But if it be any part of religion to believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties that they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. 

There is a different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to be abnegated. "Pagan self-assertion" is one of the elements of human worth, as well as "Christian self-denial."[12] There is a Greek ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of self-government blends with, but does not supersede. It may be better to be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles than either; nor would a Pericles, if we had one in these days, be without anything good which belonged to John Knox.

It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others. There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is composed of them. 

As much compression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means of development which the individual loses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of other people. 

Even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint. If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons should be allowed to lead[Pg 119] different lives. In proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as Individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men.
