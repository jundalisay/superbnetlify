UTILITARIANISM. -->

<!-- There are few circumstances among those which make up the present condition of human knowledge, more unlike what might have been expected, or more significant of the backward state in which speculation on the most important subjects still lingers, than the little progress which has been made in the decision of the controversy respecting the criterion of right and wrong.  -->

What is the foundation of morality?

<!-- From the dawn of philosophy, the question concerning the summum bonum, or, what is the same thing, concerning the foundation of morality, has been accounted the main problem in speculative thought, has occupied the most gifted intellects, and divided them into sects and schools, carrying on a vigorous warfare against one another. And after more than two thousand years the same discussions continue, philosophers are still ranged under the same contending banners, and neither thinkers nor mankind at large seem nearer to being unanimous on the subject, than when  -->

This question has divided many people from the dawn of philosophy.

The young Socrates listened to the old Protagoras, the sophist, and asserted the theory of utilitarianism against the popular morality.

A similar confusion and uncertainty afflicts <!-- , and in some cases similar discordance, exist respecting --> the first principles of all the sciences, even <!--  not excepting that which is deemed the most certain of them, --> mathematics. 

<!-- ; without much impairing, generally indeed without impairing at all, the trustworthiness of the conclusions of those sciences. 

An apparent anomaly, the explanation of which is, that the detailed doctrines of a science are not usually deduced from, nor depend for their evidence upon, what are called its first principles. Were it not so, there would be no science more precarious, or whose conclusions were more insufficiently made out, than algebra; which derives none of its certainty from what are commonly taught to learners as its elements, since these, as laid down by some of its most eminent teachers, are as full of fictions as English law, and of mysteries as theology.  -->

The truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis. <!-- This is practised on the elementary notions with which the science is conversant; and their relation to the science is not that of foundations to an edifice, but of roots to a tree, which may perform their office equally well though they be never dug down to and exposed to light. But though in science the particular truths precede the general theory, the contrary might be expected to be the case with a practical art, such as morals or legislation.  -->

All action is for the sake of some end. The rules of action must take their whole character from this end. 

When we engage in a pursuit, a clear and precise conception of what we are pursuing would seem to be the first thing we need, instead of the last we are to look forward to. A test of right and wrong must be the means, one would think, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence of having already ascertained it.

The difficulty is not avoided by having recourse to the popular theory of a natural faculty, a sense or instinct, informing us of right and wrong. For—besides that the existence of such a moral instinct is itself one of the matters in dispute—those believers in it who have any pretensions to philosophy, have been obliged to abandon the idea that it discerns what is right or wrong in the particular case in hand, as our other senses discern the sight or sound actually present. Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments; it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive faculty; and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality, not for perception of it in the concrete. 

Both the intuitive and the inductive school of ethics insist on the necessity of general laws. They  agree that the morality of an action is not a question of direct perception, but of the application of a law to an individual case. 

They recognise the same moral laws. But they differ as to:
- their evidence, and
- the source of the morality

They think that the principles of morals are evident à priori.
- One school thinks that morality is inherent and needs only that <!-- needs nothing to command assent, except that --> the meaning of the terms be understood. 
- Another school says that morality and truth & falsehood are derived from observation and experience. 

But believe that <!-- morality both hold equally that morality must be deduced from principles; and the intuitive school affirm as strongly as the inductive, that --> there is a science of morals. Yet they are unable to <!-- seldom attempt to make out --> create a list of the à priori principles for this <!-- which are to serve as the premises of the --> science. 

<!--  still more rarely do they make any effort to reduce those various principles to one first principle, or common ground of obligation.  -->

They merely:
- assume the ordinary precepts of morals as the à priori authority, or
- they use some general principles that are not so <!-- lay down as the common groundwork of those maxims, some generality much less obviously --> authoritative <!-- than the maxims themselves, and which has never succeeded in gaining --> are are not accepted in the mainstream.  <!-- popular acceptance.  -->

<!-- Yet to support their pretensions there ought either to be some one fundamental principle or law, at the root of all morality, or if there be several, there should be a determinate order of precedence among them; and the one principle, or the rule for deciding between the various principles when they conflict, ought to be self-evident.

To inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been mitigated in practice, or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind have been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct recognition of an ultimate standard, would imply  -->

To come up with the proper principles of morals, we must do a complete survey and criticism of past and present ethical doctrine. This requires a standard. We can use people's feelings as such a standard. 

The most common feeling to all is the happiness coming from utility. Bentham called it, the greatest happiness principle. This idea was scorned by some people. 

<!-- It would, however, be easy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs have attained, has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard not recognised. Although the non-existence of an acknowledged first principle has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men's actual sentiments, still, as men's sentiments, both of favour and of aversion, are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects of things upon their happiness, the principle of utility, or as Bentham latterly called it, the greatest happiness principle, has had a large share in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully reject its authority.  -->

Nor is there any school of thought which refuses to admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material and even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals, however unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of morality, and the source of moral obligation. 

I might go much further, and say that to all those à priori moralists who deem it necessary to argue at all, 

Utilitarian arguments are indispensable. 

<!-- It is not my present purpose to criticise these thinkers; but I cannot help referring, for illustration, to a systematic treatise by one of the most illustrious of them, the Metaphysics of Ethics, by Kant.  -->

### Kant's Metaphysics of Ethics

<!-- This remarkable man, whose system of thought will long remain one of the landmarks in the history of philosophical speculation, does, in the treatise in question,  -->

He laid down an universal first principle as the origin and ground of moral obligation:

<div class="squote kant" data-sal="slide-right">
The moral rule is that which is <!--  So act, that the rule on which thou actest would admit of being --> can be adopted as a law by all rational beings.
</div>

But he fails to show how actual moral duties can actually be adopted by all. 

<!-- But when he begins to deduce from this precept any of the actual duties of morality, he fails, almost grotesquely, to show that there would be any contradiction, any logical (not to say physical) impossibility, in the adoption by all rational beings of the most outrageously immoral rules of conduct.  -->

<!-- All he shows is that the consequences of their universal adoption would be such as no one would choose to incur. -->

On the present occasion, I shall, without further discussion of the other theories, attempt to contribute something towards the understanding and appreciation of the Utilitarian or Happiness theory, and towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term. 

Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever can be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof. 

The art of medicine is good by its conducing to health. But how can we prove that health is good? 

The art of music is good because it produces pleasure. But how can we prove that this pleasure is good?


### The Formula for Morals 

<!-- If there is a comprehensive formula to prove such goodness , including all things which are in themselves good, and that whatever else is good, is not so as an end, but as a mean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof. 

We are not, however, to infer that its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse, or arbitrary choice. 

There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of philosophy. The subject is within the cognizance of the rational faculty; and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way of intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and this is equivalent to proof. -->

<!-- What is the nature of these considerations? How do they apply?  -->

What rational grounds can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian formula of morals?

This formula should be correctly understood first. 

Its name creates a very imperfect notion <!-- that  ordinarily formed of its meaning, is the chief obstacle --> which impedes its reception. 

This can be simplified if the definition of utilitarianism can be cleared up, which is what the next chapters will do.  

<!-- ; and that could it be cleared, even from only the grosser misconceptions, the question would be greatly simplified, and a large proportion of its difficulties removed. Before, therefore, I attempt to enter into the philosophical grounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard, I shall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself; with the view of showing more clearly what it is, distinguishing it from what it is not, and disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either originate in, or are closely connected with, mistaken interpretations of its meaning. Having thus prepared the ground, I shall afterwards endeavour to throw such light as I can upon the question, considered as one of philosophical theory.
