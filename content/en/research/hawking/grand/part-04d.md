A key quantum principle is the principle that observing a system must alter its course. 

Can’t we, as we do when our supervisor has a spot of mustard on her chin,
discreetly watch but not interfere? No. According to quantum physics, you cannot “just” observe
something. That is, quantum physics recognizes that to make an observation, you must interact
with the object you are observing. For instance, to see an object in the traditional sense, we shine a light on it.

Shining a light on a pumpkin will of course have little effect on it. But shining even a dim light on a tiny quantum particle—that is, shooting photons at it—does have an appreciable effect, and experiments show that it changes the results of an experiment in just the way that quantum physics describes. 

Suppose that, as before, we send a stream of particles toward the barrier in the double-slit
experiment and collect data on the first million particles to get through. When we plot the number
of particles landing at various detection points the data will form the interference pattern pictured, and when we add the phases associated with all the possible paths from a particle’s starting point
A to its detection point B, we will find that the probability we calculate of landing at various points
agrees with that data.
Now suppose we repeat the experiment, this time shining lights on the slits so that we know an
intermediate point, C, through which the particle passed. (C is the position of either one of the slits
or the other.) 

This is called “which-path” information because it tells us whether each particle went from A to slit 1 to B, or from A to slit 2 to B. Since we now know through which slit each particle
passed, the paths in our sum for that particle will now include only paths that travel through slit 1, or only paths that travel through slit 2. It will never include both the paths that go through slit 1 and the paths that pass through slit 2. Because Feynman explained the interference pattern by
saying that paths that go through one slit interfere with paths that go through the other, if you turn on a light to determine which slit the particles pass through, thereby eliminating the other option, you will make the interference pattern disappear. And indeed, when the experiment is performed, turning on a light changes the results from the interference pattern, to a pattern like that! 

Moreover, we can vary the experiment by employing very faint light so that not all of the particles interact with the light. In that case we are able to obtain which-path information for only some subset of the particles. 

If we then divide the data on particle arrivals according to whether or not we obtained which-path information, we find that data pertaining to the subset for which we have no whichpath information will form an interference pattern, and the subset of data pertaining to the particles for which we do have which-path information will not show interference. 

This idea has important implications for our concept of “the past.” In Newtonian theory, the past is
assumed to exist as a definite series of events. If you see that vase you bought in Italy last year
lying smashed on the floor and your toddler standing over it looking sheepish, you can trace
backward the events that led to the mishap: the little fingers letting go, the vase falling and
exploding into a thousand pieces as it hits. In fact, given complete data about the present,
Newton’s laws allow one to calculate a complete picture of the past. This is consistent with our
intuitive understanding that, whether painful or joyful, the world has a definite past. There may
have been no one watching, but the past exists as surely as if you had taken a series of snapshots of it.

But a quantum buckyball cannot be said to have taken a definite path from source to screen. We
might pin down a buckyball’s location by observing it, but in between our observations, it takes all
paths. Quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present, the
(unobserved) past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities. 

The universe, according to quantum physics, has no single past, or history.
The fact that the past takes no definite form means that observations you make on a system in the
present affect its past. That is underlined rather dramatically by a type of experiment thought up by
physicist John Wheeler, called a delayed-choice experiment. Schematically, a delayed-choice
experiment is like the double-slit experiment we just described, in which you have the option of
observing the path that the particle takes, except in the delayed-choice experiment you postpone
your decision about whether or not to observe the path until just before the particle hits the
detection screen.
Delayed-choice experiments result in data identical to those we get when we choose to observe (or
not observe) the which-path information by watching the slits themselves. But in this case the path
each particle takes—that is, its past—is determined long after it passed through the slits and
presumably had to “decide” whether to travel through just one slit, which does not produce
interference, or both slits, which does.

Wheeler even considered a cosmic version of the experiment, in which the particles involved are
photons emitted by powerful quasars billions of light-years away. Such light could be split into
two paths and refocused toward earth by the gravitational lensing of an intervening galaxy.
Though the experiment is beyond the reach of current technology, if we could collect enough
photons from this light, they ought to form an interference pattern. Yet if we place a device to
measure which-path information shortly before detection, that pattern should disappear. The
choice whether to take one or both paths in this case would have been made billions of years ago,
before the earth or perhaps even our sun was formed, and yet with our observation in the
laboratory we will be affecting that choice.
In this chapter we have illustrated quantum physics employing the double-slit experiment. In what
follows we will apply Feynman’s formulation of quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole.
We will see that, like a particle, the universe doesn’t have just a single history, but every possible
history, each with its own probability; and our observations of its current state affect its past and
determine the different histories of the universe, just as the observations of the particles in the
double-slit experiment affect the particles’ past. That analysis will show how the laws of nature in
our universe arose from the big bang. But before we examine how the laws arose, we’ll talk a little
bit about what those laws are, and some of the mysteries that they provoke.
