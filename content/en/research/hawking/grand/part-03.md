A FEW YEARS AGO the city council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved goldfish bowls. 

The measure’s sponsor explained the measure in part by saying that it is cruel to keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish would have a distorted view of reality. 

But how do we know we have the true, undistorted picture of reality?

Might not we ourselves also be inside some big goldfish bowl and have our vision distorted by an enormous lens? 

The goldfish’s picture of reality is different from ours, but can we be sure it is less real?

The goldfish view is not the same as our own, but goldfish could still formulate scientific laws governing the motion of the objects they observe outside their bowl. 

For example, due to the distortion, a freely moving object that we would observe to move in a straight line would be observed by the goldfish to move along a curved path. Nevertheless, the goldfish could formulate scientific laws from their distorted frame of reference that would always hold true and that would enable them to make predictions about the future motion of objects outside the bowl. 

Their laws would be more complicated than the laws in our frame, but simplicity is a matter of taste. If a goldfish formulated such a theory, we would have to admit the goldfish’s view as a valid picture of reality.

A famous example of different pictures of reality is the model introduced around AD 150 by Ptolemy (ca. 85—ca. 165) to describe the motion of the celestial bodies. 

Ptolemy published his work in a thirteen-book treatise usually known under its Arabic title, Almagest. The Almagest
begins by explaining reasons for thinking that the earth is spherical, motionless, positioned at the
center of the universe, and negligibly small in comparison to the distance of the heavens. Despite
Aristarchus’s heliocentric model, these beliefs had been held by most educated Greeks at least
since the time of Aristotle, who believed for mystical reasons that the earth should be at the center
of the universe. In Ptolemy’s model the earth stood still at the center and the planets and the stars
moved around it in complicated orbits involving epicycles, like wheels on wheels.

This model seemed natural because we don’t feel the earth under our feet moving (except in
earthquakes or moments of passion). Later European learning was based on the Greek sources that
had been passed down, so that the ideas of Aristotle and Ptolemy became the basis for much of
Western thought. Ptolemy’s model of the cosmos was adopted by the Catholic Church and held as
official doctrine for fourteen hundred years. It was not until 1543 that an alternative model was put
forward by Copernicus in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of
the Celestial Spheres), published only in the year of his death (though he had worked on his theory
for several decades).
Copernicus, like Aristarchus some seventeen centuries earlier, described a world in which the sun
was at rest and the planets revolved around it in circular orbits. 

Though the idea wasn’t new, its revival was met with passionate resistance. The Copernican model was held to contradict the
Bible, which was interpreted as saying that the planets moved around the earth, even though the Bible never clearly stated that. In fact, at the time the Bible was written people believed the earth was flat. 

The Copernican model led to a furious debate as to whether the earth was at rest, culminating in Galileo’s trial for heresy in 1633 for advocating the Copernican model, and for thinking “that one may hold and defend as probable an opinion after it has been declared and
defined contrary to the Holy Scripture.” 

He was found guilty, confined to house arrest for the rest of his life, and forced to recant. He is said to have muttered under his breath “Eppur si muove,” “But still it moves.”

In 1992, the Roman Catholic Church finally acknowledged that it had been wrong to condemn Galileo.

So which is real, the Ptolemaic or Copernican system? 

Although people say that Copernicus proved Ptolemy wrong, that is not true.

As in the case of our normal view versus that of the goldfish, one can use either picture as a model of the universe, for our observations of the heavens can be explained by assuming either the earth or the sun to be at rest.

Despite its role in philosophical debates over the nature of our universe, the real advantage of the Copernican system is simply that the equations of motion are much simpler in the frame of reference in which the sun is at rest.

A different kind of alternative reality occurs in the science fiction film The Matrix, in which the
human race is unknowingly living in a simulated virtual reality created by intelligent computers to
keep them pacified and content while the computers suck their bioelectrical energy (whatever that
is). Maybe this is not so far-fetched, because many people prefer to spend their time in the
simulated reality of websites such as Second Life. How do we know we are not just characters in a
computer-generated soap opera? If we lived in a synthetic imaginary world, events would not
necessarily have any logic or consistency or obey any laws.

The aliens in control might find it more interesting or amusing to see our reactions, for example, if the full moon split in half, or
everyone in the world on a diet developed an uncontrollable craving for banana cream pie. But if the aliens did enforce consistent laws, there is no way we could tell there was another reality behind the simulated one. 

It would be easy to call the world the aliens live in the “real” one and the synthetic world a “false” one. But if—like us—the beings in the simulated world could not gaze
into their universe from the outside, there would be no reason for them to doubt their own pictures
of reality. This is a modern version of the idea that we are all figments of someone else’s dream.

These examples bring us to a conclusion that will be important in this book: There is no picture- or
theory-independent concept of reality. Instead we will adopt a view that we will call modeldependent realism: the idea that a physical theory or world picture is a model (generally of a
mathematical nature) and a set of rules that connect the elements of the model to observations.
This provides a framework with which to interpret modern science.

Philosophers from Plato onward have argued over the years about the nature of reality. 

Classical science is based on the belief that there exists a real external world whose properties are definite and independent of the observer who perceives them. According to classical science, certain objects exist and have physical properties, such as speed and mass, that have well-defined values.


In this view our theories are attempts to describe those objects and their properties, and our measurements and perceptions correspond to them. Both observer and observed are parts of a world that has an objective existence, and any distinction between them has no meaningful significance. 

In other words, if you see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it is because there really is a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage. 

All other observers who look will measure the same properties, and the herd will have those properties whether anyone observes them or not. In philosophy that belief is called realism. 

Though realism may be a tempting viewpoint, as we’ll see later, what we know about modern physics makes it a difficult one to defend. For example, according to the principles of quantum physics, which is an accurate description of nature, a particle has neither a definite position nor a
definite velocity unless and until those quantities are measured by an observer. It is therefore not
correct to say that a measurement gives a certain result because the quantity being measured had
that value at the time of the measurement. In fact, in some cases individual objects don’t even have
an independent existence but rather exist only as part of an ensemble of many. And if a theory
called the holographic principle proves correct, we and our four-dimensional world may be
shadows on the boundary of a larger, five-dimensional space-time. In that case, our status in the
universe is analogous to that of the goldfish.

Strict realists often argue that the proof that scientific theories represent reality lies in their success. But different theories can successfully describe the same phenomenon through disparate conceptual frameworks. In fact, many scientific theories that had proven successful were later
replaced by other, equally successful theories based on wholly new concepts of reality.

Traditionally those who didn’t accept realism have been called anti-realists. Anti-realists suppose a distinction between empirical knowledge and theoretical knowledge. 

They typically argue that observation and experiment are meaningful but that theories are no more than useful instruments that do not embody any deeper truths underlying the observed phenomena. Some anti-realists have even wanted to restrict science to things that can be observed. 

For that reason, many in the 19th century rejected the idea of atoms on the grounds that we would never see one. George Berkeley (1685–1753) even went as far as to say that nothing exists except the mind and its ideas. 

When a friend remarked to English author and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709–1784)
that Berkeley’s claim could not possibly be refuted, Johnson is said to have responded by walking
over to a large stone, kicking it, and proclaiming, “I refute it thus.” Of course the pain Dr. Johnson experienced in his foot was also an idea in his mind, so he wasn’t really refuting Berkeley’s ideas.

But his act did illustrate the view of philosopher David Hume (1711–1776), who wrote that
although we have no rational grounds for believing in an objective reality, we also have no choice
but to act as if it is true.

Model-dependent realism short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and
anti-realist schools of thought.


According to model-dependent realism, it is pointless to ask whether a model is real, only whether it agrees with observation. If there are two models that both agree with observation, like the goldfish’s picture and ours, then one cannot say that one is more real than another. One can use
whichever model is more convenient in the situation under consideration. For example, if one were inside the bowl, the goldfish’s picture would be useful, but for those outside, it would be very awkward to describe events from a distant galaxy in the frame of a bowl on earth, especially
because the bowl would be moving as the earth orbits the sun and spins on its axis.

We make models in science, but we also make them in everyday life. Model-dependent realism applies not only to scientific models but also to the conscious and subconscious mental models we all create in order to interpret and understand the everyday world. 

There is no way to remove the observer—us—from our perception of the world, which is created through our sensory processing and through the way we think and reason. 

Our perception—and hence the observations upon which our theories are based—is not direct, but rather is shaped by a kind of lens, the interpretive structure of our human brains.
