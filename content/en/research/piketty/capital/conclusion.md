<!-- I have presented the current state of our historical knowledge concerning the dynamics of the distribution of wealth and income since the eighteenth century, and I have attempted to draw from this knowledge whatever lessons can be drawn for the century ahead.

The sources on which this book draws are more extensive than any previous author has assembled, but they remain imperfect and incomplete. All of my conclusions are by nature tenuous and deserve to be questioned and debated. It is not the purpose of social science research to produce mathematical certainties that can substitute for open, democratic debate in which all shades of opinion are represented. -->

## The Central Contradiction of Capitalism

The Central Contradiction of Capitalism is:

`r > g`


A market economy based on private property, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence, associated in particular with the diffusion of knowledge and skills. It also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to= 
- democratic societies 
- the values of social justice on which they are based.

The principal destabilizing force is rate of return on private capital `r` being significantly higher for long periods than the rate of growth of income and output `g`.

The inequality `r > g` implies that wealth accumulated in the past grows more rapidly than output and wages. 
- This inequality is a fundamental logical contradiction. 

It turns the entrepreneur into a rentier, more and more dominant over the workers. Once constituted, capital reproduces itself faster than the increase in output. The past devours the future.

The consequences for the long-term dynamics of the wealth distribution are potentially terrifying. This is especially true since= 
- the return on capital varies directly with the initial size of capital
- this divergence in the wealth distribution is occurring on a global scale

The problem is enormous, and there is no simple solution. Growth can be encouraged by investing in education, knowledge, and nonpolluting technologies. But none of these will raise the growth rate to 4-5% a year. 

Only the countries that are catching up with more advanced economies can grow at such rates. Examples are: 
- Europe during the three decades after World War 2
- China and other emerging countries  

<!-- For countries at the world technological frontier—and thus ultimately for the planet as a whole—there is ample reason to believe that the  -->

The natural growth rate <!-- for backward countries, and --> for backward countries, and the planet as a whole, will not exceed 1–1.5% in the long run, no matter what economic policies are adopted.

If the average return on capital of 4–5%, then `r > g` will again become the norm in the 21st century. This is the same as just before World War I. 

In the 20th century, <!-- , as it had been throughout history until the eve of . In the twentieth century --> it took two world wars to wipe away the past and significantly reduce the return on capital. It created the illusion that the fundamental structural contradiction of capitalism `r > g` had been overcome.

Capital income can be taxed heavily to reduce the private return on capital to be less than the growth rate. But this might <!-- But if one did that indiscriminately and heavy-handedly, one would risk --> kill the motor of accumulation and thus further reduce the growth rate. There would no longer be any entrepreneurs who might become <!-- would then no longer have the time to turn into --> rentiers. <!-- , since there would be no more entrepreneurs. -->

**The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital*.** 



This will prevent an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation. 

For example, a capital tax schedule with rates of:
- 0.1% on fortunes under 1m euros
- 1% fortunes between 1-5m euros
- 2% between 5-10m euros
- 5-10% for fortunes of several hundred million euros

This would contain the unlimited growth of global inequality of wealth. <!-- , which is currently increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained in the long run and that ought to worry even the most fervent champions of the self-regulated market. -->  <!-- Historical experience shows, moreover, that such immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial spirit and are of no use in promoting growth. Nor are they of any “common utility,” to borrow the nice expression from the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen with which I began this book. --> This progressive tax on capital will require a high level of international cooperation and regional political integration. Nation-states cannot do this alone. 

People fear that such political integration= 
- will undermine the existing achievements of welfare states [that already have high taxation]
- will only really just create more competition even if such competition cannot change inequality `r > g` since this inequality is not caused by imperfect competition

<!-- It is not within the reach of the nation-states in which earlier social compromises were hammered out. Many people worry that moving toward greater cooperation and political integration within, say, the European Union only undermines existing achievements (starting with the social states that the various countries of Europe constructed in response to the shocks of the twentieth century) without constructing anything new other than a vast market predicated on ever purer and more perfect competition.  -->

<!-- Yet pure and perfect competition cannot alter the inequality r > g, which is not the consequence of any market “imperfection.” On the contrary. Although the risk is real, I do not see any genuine  -->

But we have no choice. If the people are to regain control of capitalism, we must bet everything on a large-scale democracy. 

<!-- —and in Europe, democracy on a European scale.  -->

Larger political communities such as the United States and China have more options. But small European countries who leave the EU will just have even worse frustration and disappointment.

<!--  national withdrawal can only lead to  than currently exists with the European Union.  -->

<!-- The nation-state is still the right level at which to modernize any number of social and fiscal policies and to develop new forms of governance and shared ownership intermediate between public and private ownership, which is one of the major challenges for the century ahead. But  -->

Only regional political integration can lead to effective regulation of the globalized patrimonial 21st century capitalism.
