## Chapter 1: The Names of the Tao

{{< s v="1">}} <!-- The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. --> The Tao is 'nature' and has two versions:
- a plain nature 'tao'
- a True Nature 'Tao'

The plain nature is temporary, but the True Nature is unchanging.


{{< s v="2">}} As True Nature, the Tao is <!-- When having no name, it --> is the Originator of heaven and earth as the creative principle. As tao, <!-- When having a name, --> it is Mother Nature<!--  of all things --> or the operating principle.


{{< s v="3">}} If we want to discover the deep mystery of the Tao, we must always be without desire. But if we always have desire, we shall only see Its outer fringe.


{{< s v="4">}} Under these two aspects, the Tao and the tao are really the same. But as development takes place, it receives different names. Together we call them the Mystery -- the deepest gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.


## Chapter 2: The Tao or True Nature is Non-dualistic, the tao or nature is Dualistic

{{< s v="1" >}} We know ugliness by knowing the beauty of the beautiful. They know the lack of skill by knowing the skill of the skillful


{{< s v="2">}} So it is that:
- existence and non-existence give birth the one to the idea of the other
- difficulty and ease produce the idea of the other
- length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other
- the ideas of height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other
- the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another
- that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.


{{< s v="3">}}  Therefore, the knowers of the Tao or True Nature of affairs manages affairs without doing anything about the tao or nature, since the Tao is the cause and the tao is the effect. Likewise, they convey their instructions without speaking because the tao or nature follows.


{{< s v="4">}} All things spring up. They grow and there is no claim made for their ownership. They go through their processes, and there is no expectation of a reward for the results. The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it as an achievement. The work is done, but no one can see how. This makes the power not cease to be.



## Chapter 13: Favor and Disgrace

{{< s v="1">}} The duality of the tao leads to the opposing perceptions of favour and disgrace, which would seem equally to be feared, in the same way as honour and great calamity are to be regarded as personal conditions of the same kind.


{{< s v="2">}} What is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared?

- Disgrace is being in a low position after the enjoyment of favour.  
- The getting of that favour leads to the apprehension of losing it. 
- The losing it leads to the fear of still greater calamity. 

What does it is mean to say that honour and great calamity are to be similarly regarded as personal conditions? 

What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I did not have the body, no great calamity could come to me.


{{< s v="3">}} Therefore:
- a state's governor should honour the state as he honours himself
- a state's administrator should love the state as he loves himself. <!--  to his own person may be entrusted with it.
