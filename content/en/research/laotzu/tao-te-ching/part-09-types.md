## Chapter 38: Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety

{{< s v="1">}} Those who possessed in highest degree the attributes of the Tao did not seek to show them. Therefore, they possessed them in the fullest measure. 

Those who possessed those attributes in a lower degree sought how not to lose them. Therefore, they did not possess them in the fullest measure.


{{< s v="2">}} Those who possessed in the highest degree those attributes:
- did nothing with a purpose, and 
- had no need to do anything

Those who possessed them in a lower degree:
- were always doing, and
- needed to do so.


{{< s v="3">}} Those who possessed the highest benevolence:
- were always seeking to carry it out, and
- had no need to be doing so. 

Those who possessed the highest righteousness:
- were always seeking to carry it out, and
- needed to do so.


{{< s v="4">}} Those who possessed the highest sense of propriety were always seeking to show it. When men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them.


{{< s v="5">}} Thus, it was then when the Tao or True Nature was lost and its attributes appeared. When its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared. When benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared. When righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared.



{{< s v="6">}} Propriety is the attenuated form of <!-- leal-heartedness and --> good faith. It is also the start of disorder. Swift apprehension is only a flower of the Tao or True Nature, and is the beginning of stupidity.


{{< s v="7">}} Thus it is that the Great man:
- abides by what is solid and avoids what is flimsy
- dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. 

He puts away the one and chooses the other.



## Chapter 41: The Wise, Ordinary, and Ignorant

{{< s v="1">}} When the scholars of the highest class hear about the Tao or True Nature, they earnestly carry it into practice. 

When the scholars of the middle class hear about it, they keep it but lose it eventually. 

When the scholars of the lowest class hear about it, they laugh greatly at it. If it were not laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao or True Nature.


{{< s v="2">}} Therefore the wise have said:<!--  sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:â€” -->

'The tao at its brightest seems to lack light.
Whoever progress in it seems to be not progressing.
Its straight path is like a rugged track.
Its highest virtue rises from the bottom.
Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes.
He who has the least supplies has most of the Tao.
Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low.
Its solid truth seems to undergo changes.
<!-- Its largest square doth yet no corner show -->
It is a huge vessel made in the slowest way.
It sounds loud but has never said a word.
It is like the shadow of the shade<!-- A semblance great, the shadow of a shade. -->'


{{< s v="3">}} The Tao or True Nature is hidden and has no name. But it is the tao or nature which is skillful at:
- imparting to all things what they need, and 
- making them complete.
