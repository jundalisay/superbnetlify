## Chapter 11: The Aether

The 30 spokes of a wheel unite in the one hub. A wheel's usefulness is in this empty space in the hub.<!--  (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. --> 

Clay is made into pots. A pot's usefulness is in its empty hollowness. 

An apartment has its door and windows cut out from the walls. An apartment's usefulness is in the empty space inside it. 

Therefore, what is empty is useful, what is not empty is to be worked on<!--  for profitable adaptation, and  -->.



## Chapter 12: The Five Elements--Aether

<!--  plus the Four Fundamental Forces of the Standard Model of Physics -->

{{< s v="1">}} The tao has five elements derived from the perceptions of those who are created by the tao. Analogies are:

- Color having five hues from the nature of the eyes
- Music having five notes from the nature of the ears
- Tastes having five flavours from the nature of the mouth

These perceptions seduce the mind and make it hunt wastefully for rare and new perceptions. 

<!--    The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste
   Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,
   Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. -->


{{< s v="2">}} Therefore, the sage seeks to satisfy limit the desire for the deceptions of the tao. He prefers the essentials and not the infinity of such perceptions.

<!-- (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former. -->
