<!-- Now you know what  is all about and what
hundreds of thousands of men and women are accomplish-
ing with it. Because  -->

The Mind Control movement is so widespread and fast-growing. 

, it is obviously not possible to tell you every-
thing that every graduate has gained from this training.

If you know any Mind Control graduates, you have probably heard a variety of reports on the benefits they are enjoying. Some use it for health, some to help them study,
others in their business lives and family relationships, and
many, who say little about it, use it to help others.

Given this variety of reports, you may wonder whether the course differs from one lecturer to another. No, it is the same throughout the world. As different as the lecturers may be—as different, for example, as you would expect a minister to be from a former stockbroker—and despite the vast freedom they are allowed in presenting the course, the mental training and exercises, and the results, remain identical.

What does differ is the personal needs of those who take
the course. Not everyone has the same problems, the same
needs. Each person, as time passes after he graduates, tends
to focus on those parts of the training that confront most
directly the problems he wants most to solve.


Later, as other problems arise, long-neglected parts of the course are put to work. The techniques, never forgotten, are easily recalled when they are needed. You will
find this true when you have reread and put into practice
the exercises in Chapters 3 through 14, and then later re-
view them.

Nevertheless, you may be tempted to say, "WelL my problem is such and such, so I'll just concentrate on that." 

The course, and the parts of it outlined in these chapters, fit together in meaningful ways that have been tested through research and long experience. One seem-
ingly unrelated part reinforces all the others, including
whichever one may interest you the most
Some of what you would get if you took the course
under a certified lecturer is omitted from my chapters
here. Does this, you may wonder, change the course? It
will change the course in two ways: The speed with which
you will learn it all will be considerably slower—weeks
with the book compared with forty-eight hours in a Mind
Control classroom. Second, there is an energy transfer
among people in a group which is a major part of the peak
experience, or "high," you have read about. However, when
you conscientiously learn all the exercises I have guided
you through, you will be able to do everything a Mind
Control graduate can do.
The reason some parts of the course are left out is not
to deliberately withhold anything from you, but simply
that they require a trained lecturer.
Many graduates find that the exercises and mental train-
ing become powerfully reinforced when they repeat the
course long after taking it the first time. They are encour-
aged to do this (without cost), and as a result ten to
twenty percent of a typical Mind Control class are re-
peaters. Many say the experience is even more intense the
second time. If you go on to take the course, your first
time will be a deeper experience because of your mastery
of the techniques in this book.
Here, in outline, is everything Mind Control students go
through in their classes:174 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
Morning of the FtrU Day
9:00 The day begins with a lecture to give students
a general preview of the entire course.
10:20 Coffee break.
10:40 Questions, answers, and discussion, then a de-
tailed preview of the first meditation.
11:30 The lecturer leads students for the first time to
a meditative, or Alpha, level of mind. They
may squirm or scratch as they wish, though at
this and deeper levels the body requires less
attention as it becomes more relaxed, particular-
ly while experiencing the "ideal place of relax-
ation."
12:00 Coffee break.
12:20 Lecturer leads the students again into medita-
tion, at a deeper level, though still within the
Alpha range.
12:50 Questions and answers and a general sharing
of experiences by the students.
1:00 Lunch break.
Afternoon of the First Day
2:00 Lecturer discusses the Building Blocks of Mat-
ter—atomic, molecular, and cellular—and the
evolution of the human brain. The need for
"mental housecleaning" is discussed in detail
(see Chapter 8).
3:20 Coffee break.
3:40 The third meditation is explained in detail,
along with a swifter method of reaching the
Alpha level.
4:10 Students enter a still deeper level of mind and
achieve still greater physical relaxation.
4:40 Coffee break.
5:00 The fourth meditation reinforces the previous
three and previews the next one, when Dy-
namic Meditation begins with problem-solving
techniques.
Appendix I I 175
5:30 The students, many of them now relaxed more
than they have ever been before, share their
experiences and pose questions.
6:00 Dinner break.
Evening of the First Day
7:00 Three problem-solving techniques are de-
scribed: how to get to sleep without drugs,
how to awaken on time without an alarm
clock, and how to overcome drowsiness and
fatigue. Discussion follows.
8:20 Coffee break.
8:40 During the fifth meditation the lecturer helps
students learn these techniques while they are
at their Alpha and Theta levels.
9:10 The lecturer outlines the agenda for the sec-
ond day, then describes Mind Control's tech-
niques for programming dreams and con-
trolling migraine and tension headaches. Ques-
tions and a discussion follow.
10:10 Coffee break.
10:30 The sixth meditation completes a day in which
students have learned to meditate at deep
levels of mind and to use these levels for relax-
ation and problem solving.
Morning of the Second Day
9:00 The lecturer briefly describes the day ahead
and explains how to create and use the Mental
Screen (Chapter 3). The lecturer then demon-
strates his mastery of the Memory Pegs (Chap-
ter 5).
10:20 Coffee break.
10:40 The Memory Exercise is explained and the
next meditation is reviewed in detail.
11:00 The seventh meditation, during which—through
Speed Learning (Chapter 6)—students begin
to memorize the Memory Pegs and create their
Mental Screen.176 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
11:40 Coffee break.
12:00 During a brief lecture, students learn about the
Three Fingers Technique and how to use it for
improved memory (Chapter 5) and for Speed
Learning (Chapter 6).
12:15 The eighth meditation conditions students to
the Three Fingers Technique and teaches them
to use it. The second morning ends with ques-
tions and answers and a general discussion of
what has been accomplished.
1:00 Lunch break.
Afternoon of the Second Day
2:00 The second afternoon begins with an explana-
tion of one of the key problem-solving tech-
niques of Dynamic Meditation, the Mirror
of the Mind—an elaboration of the Mental
Screen. In addition, a deepening exercise, Hand
Levitation, and a method for controlling pain,
Glove Anesthesia, are discussed. A question
period follows.
3:20 Coffee break.
3:40 Another question-and-answer period, followed
by the ninth meditation, during which students
learn the Mirror of the Mind. Discussion fol-
lows.
4:40 Coffee break.
5:00 The tenth meditation is the deepest yet. At
these deeper levels the Memory Pegs are rein-
forced, and students practice the Hand Levita-
tion and Glove Anesthesia exercises. The
discussion period is largely a sharing of ex-
periences.
6:00 Dinner break.
Evening of the Second Day
7:00 A lecture-discussion explores various beliefs
and some research on reincarnation. The Glass
8:20

of Water technique is explained as a method
of triggering problem-solving dreams.
Coffee break.
After a brief question period, students learn
the Glass of Water technique.
The lecturer explains how to use Mind Con-
trol to break unwanted habits (Chapter 9).
Coffee break.
The lecturer previews events of the third day
and, after a brief question-and-answer period,
begins the eleventh meditation for habit con-

may demonstrate how cases will be worked on
the fourth day. The students leave relaxed and
with a growing sense of well-being.
Morning of the Third Day
9:00 This eventful day opens with a discussion of
the many differences between Mind Control
and hypnosis, particularly with respect to the
spiritual dimension in which the students are
about to function. Questions and answers.
10:20 Coffee break.
10:40 Students are told they are about to function
psychically and as a first step will mentally
project themselves from where they are to their
own living room and then into the south wall of
this room (Chapter 12).
10:55 In particularly deep meditation students vivid-
ly experience Effective Sensory Projection to
their living room and into its south wall.
11:40 Coffee break, during which the students, with
growing excitement, familiarize themselves with
metal cubes (Chapter 12).
12:00 Lecturer explains that students will mentally
project themselves into metal cubes to estab-
lish points of reference. In the thirteenth
meditation, they experience the metals' color,
temperature, odor, and sound when tapped.178 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
This is followed by a spirited sharing of ex-
periences.
1:00 Lunch break.
Afternoon of the Third Day
2:00 The lecturer discusses two new experiences in
store for the students: projection into living
plants, and deliberate shifting of time back-
ward and forward. This is followed by a deeper
exploration into the implications of Mind Con-
trol.
3:20 Coffee break.
3:40 The fourteenth meditation is explained. During
this meditation students visualize a fruit tree in
the various seasons, then mentally project
themselves into its leaves. A sharing of ex-
periences follows.

5:00 The lecturer previews another major step for-
ward: this one into a living animaL
5:15 During the fifteenth meditation students visual-
ize a pet and mentally project themselves into
it Their sensations as they enter the pet's
organs will soon be useful as reference points
in working human cases. The discussion that
follows is often the most animated so far.
6:00 Dinner break.
Evening of the Third Day
7:00 A lecture prepares students for objectively ver-
ifiable clairvoyant functioning, which they will
do tomorrow. First requirement is a fully
equipped laboratory (Chapter 12).
8:20 Coffee break.
8:40 Students are urged to exercise freedom and
imagination in creating their laboratory and its
instruments. During the sixteenth meditation
the laboratory is mentally created. In most
cases it remains basically unchanged years
Appendix I I 179
after the course, and becomes as familiar to
the graduate as his own living room. An ani-
mated sharing of experiences and laboratory
designs follows.
9:40 Coffee break.
10:00 Before the big day to come, the soon-to-be
psychics will need their counselors for consul-
tation in the laboratory. The lecturer explains
how to evoke or create them, then answers
students' questions.
10:15 The seventeenth meditation is a memorable one:
Two counselors appear in the laboratory, where
they will be available whenever the student
needs them.
10:45 The day's final discussion is filled with ex-
clamations as students share their colorful ex-
periences. Many are surprised at who turned
up as their counselors; others will have had
genuine psychic experiences.
Morning of the Fourth Day
9:00 The day opens with a lecture on psychic and
prayer healing, a preview of the events to
come, and a general discussion.
10:20 Coffee break.
10:40 In deep meditation, the students, with the help
of their counselors, examine portions of the
body of a friend or relative to establish, for
the first time, points of reference in the human
body.
11:40 Coffee break.
12:00 During the nineteenth and final group medita-
tion, students complete the psychic examination
of their friend or relative.
1:00 Lunch break.
Afternoon and Evening of the Fourth Day
2-00 The lecturer gives students detailed instructions
on how to work cases and, in pairs, they begin180 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
work—at first doubtfully, then with growing as-
surance, and finally with an exhilarating real-
ization that they have been successfully trained
to call on Higher Intelligence and function
psychically whenever they wish.
As you read the above you were probably amazed at the
frequency of the coffee breaks. Actually, very little coffee
is consumed. These breaks have several important functions
in the training. One is to allow students time to reflect on
what they have experienced. Another is to give them plenty
of unstructured time to become acquainted. This is part of
the way a powerful group spirit develops—a collective psy-
chic energy that grows as the course progresses, adding to
everyone's confidence and success. It also allows students to
stretch and to go to the bathroom. Finally, and not unim-
portant, it allows them to return to the Beta level, which
adds to the depth of later meditations. For this reason,
many lecturers call coffee breaks "Beta breaks."
The lecture material is developed largely by the lecturers
themselves, around outlines provided by headquarters in
Laredo. They draw heavily on their own backgrounds and
experiences. However, all exercises and instructions the
students hear while in meditation are delivered word for
word as I prepared them myself.
After the students graduate, there is available to them a
three-day graduate course taught by Dr. Wilfred Hahn
(Director of Research), Harry McKnight (Associate Di-
rector), James Needham (Director of Graduate Training),
and myself. This course sets forth the intellectual founda-
tions of Mind Control training and provides some addi-
tional techniques.
Many Mind Control centers offer workshops of their
own design. Some concentrate on working cases, others on
memory improvement, subjective communication, healing,
and sparking creativity.
Some graduates form organizations of their own—cot-
tage groups—and meet regularly in members' homes for
explorations in meditative technique.
Appendix I I 181
The Mind Control organization is a fairly simple one.
The Institute of Psychorientology, Inc., is the parent or-
ganization. The course is taught by Silva Mind Control
International, Inc., in 34 nations. One of its divisions, Silva
Sensor Systems, makes tapes, study aids, and research
equipment available to students and graduates, and man-
ages the Mind Control Bookstore. The Institute of Psy-
chorientology, Inc., publishes a newsletter for graduates and
holds conventions, graduate courses, seminars, and work-
shops. Mind Control research is conducted by Psychorien-
tology Studies International, Inc., a nonprofit organization.
SMCI Programs, Inc. concentrates on marketing relaxation
seminars, some of which use biofeedback custom tailored
for executives.
