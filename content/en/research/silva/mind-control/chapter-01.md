Imagine coming into direct, working contact with an all-pervading higher intelligence and learning in a moment of numinous joy that it is on your side. 

Imagine too that you made this contact in such simple ways that for the rest of your life you need never again feel helplessly out of touch with something you always suspected
was there but could never quite reach—a helpful wisdom, a fash of insight when you need it, the feeling of a loving, powerful presence. 

How would it feel?

It would be a peak experience not too different—perhaps not different at all—from spiritual awe.
This is what it feels like after four days of Silva Mind Control training. So far, more than a half-million people know; they have been through it. 

As they become more accustomed to using the methods that produce this feeling they settle down into a calm, self-confident use of new powers and energies, their lives
richer, healthier, freer of problems.

Shortly Jose Silva will explain some of these methods so that you will be able to start using them yourself. 

First let's look in on the beginning of a Mind Control class and see what takes place.

To start off, there is an introductory lecture of about an hour and twenty minutes. The lecturer defines Mind Control and outlines the two decades of research that led
to its development. 

Then, briefly, he describes ways the
students will be able to apply what they learn in improv-
ing health, solving everyday problems, learning more
easily, and deepening spiritual awareness. A twenty-
minute break follows.
Over coffee the students become acquainted. They
are from widely varying backgrounds. Physicians, sec-
retaries, teachers, taxi drivers, housewives, high-school
and college students, psychiatrists, religious leaders, re-
tired people—this is a typical mix.
After the break there is another hour-and-twenty-
minute session beginning with some questions and an-
swers, then down to business with the first training
exercise, which will lead to a meditative level of mind.
The lecturer explains that this is a state of deep relaxa-
tion, deeper than in sleep itself but accompanied by a
special kind of awareness. It is in fact an altered state
of consciousness used in virtually every meditative dis-
cipline and in intensive prayer.
No drugs or biofeedback machines are used. Mind
Control lecturers speak of entering this state as "going
to your level," or sometimes "going into Alpha." In a
thirty-minute exercise they lead the student there gently,
giving instructions in plain English. In fact all of Mind
Control is in plain English: no scientific jargon or Far
Eastern words.


Several of the students may already have learned
to meditate before coming to class, some using methods
that take a few weeks to learn, others after months of
determined effort. They are amazed at a simple exercise
that takes only thirty minutes.
One of the first things students hear is, "You are
Using More of Your Mind in Special Ways I 19
learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a
special manner."
This is a simple sentence they hear and internalize
at the outset The full meaning of it is nothing less than
stupefying. Everyone—no exceptions—everyone has a
mind that can easily be trained to exercise powers that
beginners openly doubt they have. Only when they ac-
tually experience these powers do they come to believe.
Another thing that students are told is, "Project
yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation"—a
pleasant calming, remarkably vivid exercise, which
both strengthens the imagination and leads to deeper
relaxation.
A word about meditation: In everyday speech it
means thinking things over. If you set this book aside
for a moment and consider what to have for dinner
tomorrow, you are meditating.
But in the various meditative disciplines the word
has a more specific meaning, referring to a special level
of mind. In some disciplines, reaching this level is an
end in itself, clearing the mind of all conscious thought.
This produces a pleasant calm and goes a long way to-
ward relieving and preventing illnesses caused by ten-
sion, as countless studies have proved.
But this is passive meditation. Mind Control goes far
beyond this. It teaches the student to use this level of
mind for solving problems, little nagging ones as well
as larger, burdensome ones. This is dynamic medita-
tion; the power of it is truly spectacular.
We hear more and more about Alpha nowadays. It
is one of the brain-wave patterns, a kind of electrical
energy produced by the brain, and can be measured by
an electroencephalograph (EEG). The rhythms of this
energy are measured in cycles per second (CPS). Gen-
erally, about fourteen CPS and up are called Beta20 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
waves; about seven to fourteen are Alpha; four to
seven Theta; and four and below are Delta.
When you are wide awake, doing and achieving in
the workaday world, you are in Beta, or "outer con-
sciousness," to use Mind Control terminology. When
you are daydreaming, or just going to sleep but not
quite there yet, or just awakening but not yet awake,
you are in Alpha. Mind Control people call this "inner
consciousness." When you are asleep you are in Alpha,
Theta, or Delta, not just Alpha alone, as many believe.
With Mind Control training you can enter the Alpha
level at will and still remain fully alert.
You may wonder what it feels like to be in these dif-
ferent levels of mind.
Being in Beta, or wide awake, does not produce any
one particular feeling. You might feel confident or fear-
ful, busy or idle, engrossed or bored—the possibilities
in Beta are endless.
In the deeper levels the possibilities are limited for
most people. Life has taught them to function in Beta,
not Alpha or Theta. At these deeper levels they are
pretty much limited to daydreaming, the edges of sleep,
or sleep itself. But with Mind Control training, useful
possibilities begin to multiply with no end in sight As
Harry McKnight, Associate Director of Silva Mind
Control, wrote, "The Alpha dimension has a complete
set of sensing faculties, like the Beta." In other words,
we can do different things in Alpha than we can do in
Beta.
This is a key concept in Mind Control. Once you
become acquainted with these sensing faculties and
learn to use them, you will be using more of your mind
in a special manner. You will actually operate psychi-
cally whenever you want to, tapping in on Higher In-
telligence.
Most people seek out Mind Control as a way to

relax, to end insomnia, to find relief from headaches,
or to learn to do tilings that cost great efforts of will,
such as stopping smoking, losing weight improving
memory, studying more effectively. This is what most
of them come for; they learn much, much more.
They learn that the five senses—touching, tasting,
smelling, hearing, and seeing—are only a part of the
senses they were born with. There are others, call them
powers or senses, once known only to a gifted few and
to mystics who developed them over lifetimes removed
from the active world. The mission of Mind Control is
to train us to awaken these powers.
What this awakening can mean was well put by
Mademoiselle's beauty editor, Nadine Bertin, in the
March 1972 issue:
"The drug culture can have its mind-expanding pills,
powders and shots. I l l take mine straight Mind Con-
trol does expand your mind. It teaches you HOW to
expand it. It is aptly named because, unlike drugs or
hypnosis, you are in control. Mind expansion, self-
knowledge and helping others through Mind Control
are only limited by your own limitations. ANYTHING
is possible. You hear about it happening to others. And
suddenly, you see it happening to you."
