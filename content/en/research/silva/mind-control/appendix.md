In November 1970 we attended a Silva Mind Control class in Philadelphia because we were curious about some of
their claims. As the course progressed, it became apparent to us there were three persons who were definitely emo-
tionally disturbed and a fourth whose stability was in
question. What was the reason? Did the course precipitate
emotional illness? Had they been ill when they arrived?
Were disturbed persons attracted to the course?
We discussed the possibilities with our colleagues, and
many of them speculated that the course could precipitate
acute psychosis in unstable individuals. This sounded plau-
sible. It is generally accepted that anything that facilitates
regression may bring about an acute psychosis in someone
who is so inclined. Sensory deprivation and hallucinogenic
drugs can bring on psychotic-like behavior, and even such
techniques as biofeedback and hypnosis can alter the
psyche as well. Most psychoanalysts do not recommend

formal psychoanalysis on the couch for the psychotic pa-
tient because it produces further regression. It remains
undetermined how great this risk factor is, but there are
claims that all these procedures have ended up in psy-
chosis.
In 1972 two thousand students at a Philadelphia high
school went through the SMC training with no psychiatric
casualties, according to a responsible school official. This
aroused our curiosity in another way. Since adolescents are
already in a state of ego instability, hearsay claims that the
course was dangerous for unstable individuals were thrown
into doubt Our dilemma was compounded. We saw three
disturbed individuals in a group of 30 and did not know
if they had been made better or worse. There were claims
by some members of the scientific community of large num-
bers becoming psychotic. The high-school study indicated
this was not the case. In fact some of our own patients,
even severely disturbed ones, had taken the course and ap-
peared to be dramatically benefited by it. A review of the
literature showed opinions but no actual studies.
Clearly, the only way to proceed was to evaluate and
test individuals before and after the training. Over the next
four years 189 of our psychiatric patients voluntarily went
through the Silva Mind Control training while they were
in therapy. Particular emphasis was given to a group of 75
patients who were diagnosed as psychotic, borderline, or
psychosis in remission, before entering the course. These
we called the severely disturbed group. At some time in
their lives, 60 of them had either been psychotic or had
been hospitalized.
The 75 included everyone from the severely disturbed
group found in McKenzie's practice over the last four years
who agreed to attend the SMC course (66 patients) and a
sampling found in Wright's practice over the last four years
(9 patients). There were 7 severely disturbed patients who
refused to attend, even when the course was offered free.
They were not more disturbed than the ones who did at-
tend. Those who attended included the most disturbed;
those who refused simply tended to be more rigid and in-184 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
flexible in their thinking. Presumably they would not rep-
resent persons who might get into difficulty during the
course, because they were not likely to take the course in
the first place.
Initially patients from the severely disturbed group were
sent to the course one at a time and with great caution.
During the initial part of the study the patients were sent
during a time of their remission. As the study progressed,
however, the patients were sent during less-stable periods
of their illnesses. Toward the end of the four-year period,
17 were sent while they were actively psychotic and delu-
sional, and sometimes 10 or more went through the course
at once.
In addition to their ongoing psychiatric treatment and
evaluation, 58 of the 75 were given the Experiential World
Inventory questionnaire before and after the course. The
EWI is a 400-item questionnaire designed to measure real-
ity perception. Drs. El-Meligi and Osmond, authors of the
questionnaire, attempted to put the Rorschach in question-
and-answer form, and arrived at a sensitive test for the mar-
ginal individual.
The primary purpose of the study was to find out which
patients might become more disturbed with the training. In
that regard the results were startling because only one
patient became appreciably more disturbed after the course.
He was a twenty-nine-year-old catatonic schizophrenic pa-
tient who became upset two weeks after the course when
he stopped taking his medication and began dating for the
first time in his life. He was also the only patient who
scored appreciably worse on the EWI after the course. He
did not require hospitalization.
Two other patients, one who had experienced psychotic
depression and one with involutional depression, showed
an increase in depression following the course, perhaps in
contrast to the way they had felt during the training. The
high feeling during the course was a marked contrast to
their depressive state, and the experience was like taking a
headache away from a person who had had it all his life.
Appendix II I 185
• returned it was more noticeable. However, these pa-
rents did score better on the EWI afterward, and they were
asie to make use of the training. The involutional de-
pressed patient was able to use the Mind Control program-
ming later the same week and function with less anxiety at
work; and the person with a history of psychotic depression
• i s able to work through things in therapy she had pre-
wnsly been unable to handle.
Twenty-six other depressed patients, including involu-
tional, psychotic, schizo-affective, and manic-depressive
opes, were much less depressed after the course and
•owed no harmful effects.
One woman reported a sudden feeling of sadness during
ace of the relaxations. A man, not included in the 75,
topped out after the second day because he had flashbacks
sf unpleasant Vietnam experiences. His condition was not
(bought to be worse than when he began, but he did not
' •tarn for further evaluation. (The relaxation puts persons
it touch with feelings. Usually, because the mood of the
poup is high and the focus is positive, the feelings are of
wxrmth and love, but on infrequent occasion persons evoko
sadness and unhappy memories.)
Still another patient (not in the severely disturbed group)
• i- afraid of the things to be done on the last day of the
coarse, and after a bad dream did not go to the last day.
A paranoid schizophrenic man, age thirty, demonstrated
jreat exuberance, approaching cyclothymic proportions,
after the course. He tried various Mind Control techniques
(> determine what to do with the rest of his life, and spent
many hours checking out possibilities from programmed
ireams. This was seen as an increase of compulsive de-
feases. Nevertheless, as a result of his heightened activity,
ie was able to go back to school to earn his Ph.D. He also
vas able to discuss a delusional system he had experienced
several years before, when he thought he was sent tele-
pathically on a mission to kill someone. If he had not taken
the course, this might never have been brought up and
resolved.
In comparison with the relatively few and minor negative
;186 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
effects of the course, the positive effects and results would
require a book to describe. The most consistent finding was
one we were not looking for and did not expect In almost
every instance there was an increase in reality perception.
Of the 58 who took the EWI, one became appreciably
worse, 21 remained about the same, and 36 demonstrated
an impressive increase in reality perception. Of the 21 who
remained about the same, 15 had scores that moved in the
healthy direction.
The average scores of the first 20 women who took the
course were sent to Dr. El-Meligi, co-author of the EWI
questionnaire. He lauded the dramatic changes that took
place after the Silva Mind Control training and said that in
some categories the before and after scores were like those
of a person during and after a bad LSD trip (see charts A
and B). In each of the eleven categories there was con-
sistent improvement Individual scores were more impres-
sive (charts E, F, and G). Composite scores of the 50 per-
cent of the men and women who improved the most are
indicated in charts C and D. It is thought that no conven-
tional psychotherapy could produce as much change in a
week; indeed, it might have required months or years of
therapy.
One involutional paranoid woman's scores changed as
much with the one-week course as they had on another oc-
casion with eleven electroshock treatments and twelve weeks
of hospitalization. After the one-week course, she was able
to get on a bus by herself for the first time in four years.
Another woman, who was paranoid schizophrenic and
acutely delusional, maintained some of her delusional
thoughts after the course, but was able to go repeatedly to
her "Mind Control level" to examine these thoughts, and
each time arrive at clear, rational ideation.
Another woman, with an acute undifferentiated schizo-
phrenic reaction, was too disturbed to fill out the EWL
She was given her choice: shock treatment or Mind Con-
trol. At the end of the course there was clinical improve-
ment, and she not only could fill out the EWI but she
scored quite well on it
Appendix 11 I 187
Still another, a hypochondriacal woman with a history of
arenty operations, was about to have another. While the
sternal-medicine specialists were still checking out the
ieart and kidneys, she used a Mind Control technique to
program a dream that diagnosed an intestinal obstruction
• the ileocecal junction. She discovered from the same
cream that she had produced the obstruction and how and
why. Mind Control techniques enabled her to release the
obstruction in a sudden, unexplained way one hour after
™e diagnosis was confirmed at the surgical hospital. The
mrt location of this obstruction was confirmed from
records of previous surgery.
Another very distracted twenty-one-year-old woman was
iangerously suicidal and in the early phases of an acute
psychosis. The patient had assured us there was nothing
-s could possibly do that would help, and that she prob-
ably was just going to kill herself. We sent her to the Mind
Control course under careful monitoring. Much to our
•apprise, she became remarkably calm, was more rational,
ter thought processes no longer raced in all directions at
•3o.ce, and she was less pessimistic. Hospitalization and high
•nses of medication could not have calmed her as much.
&e repeated the course two weeks later and again im-
proved. She had changed dramatically for the better.
Yet another very delusional individual, who thought he
aould shrink people, took the course while hospitalized,
returning each day to the hospital. Although he continued
to think he could shrink people, he was remarkably calmed,
=se affect was improved, other parts of the delusional sys-
tem were fading, and he no longer spent hours ruminating
•toer the meaning of simple parables. He took the course
| «toring his sixth week of hospitalization, and the changes
•m more dramatic than during all of the previous five
weeks. (See chart E).
An involutional paranoid woman was back to her nor-
n a l self after the course. Several others had a better un-
derstanding of their illnesses as a result of portions of the
course.188 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
Clinically, the severely disturbed group as a whole
showed an impressive change. Only one became more up-
set All the others benefited to some degree from the train-
ing. There was an increase in emotional energy after the
course and an improvement in affect Many persons with
flat affect showed enthusiasm for the first time. They had a
more positive outlook about their future, and for some
there was a better understanding of their psychotic pro-
cesses. Even some who maintained delusional thought were
able to evaluate their ideation at the "Mind Control level"
and arrive at clarity and understanding.
There was a greater relaxation and lessening of anxiety.
Patients learned to rely on their own inner resources to
understand, cope with, and solve problems, and being able
to do so gave them more self-confidence.
Some of the patients who had been psychotic found that
their illness had enhanced their ability to function in an
altered state of consciousness, and this added meaning to
their prolonged illness and meaning to their lives.
Neurotic patients (114 of them) showed no negative ef-
fects clinically. Six of them took the EWI. Their scores im-
proved, but not as much as the severely disturbed group's,
because their first scores were already so near the healthy
end of the scale. Invariably the neurotic patients seemed to
benefit from SMC training. Those who continued to prac-
tice the techniques after training were able to alter their
lives greatly, and even those who did not practice the tech-
niques steadily were able to use them in times of personal
crisis: when they had to cope with stress or had important
decisions to make. For all it seemed to be a mind-expand-
ing experience, a revelation that they could use their minds
in new ways. Group enthusiasm mounted toward the end
of the course, and most persons experienced a higher and
more positive emotional level.
In general, both the neurotic and psychotic groups im-
proved after the course, as demonstrated on psychological
examination and as determined clinically. Only one out of
189 patients became appreciably worse.
Appendix II I 189

Data from any research have to be evaluated in light of
ail conditions present the tests and criteria used, and the
are that goes into the study. Therefore, we will try to point
xt all the factors we are aware of that might have in-
fcriKid the result.
From the standpoint of research, we wanted to know
what effect the training had on disturbed individuals. As
physicians, we wanted our patients all to get well. This
Kdoubtedly had some bearing on the result as they surely
•eased this. We believe our optimism carried over in some
way; this is an integral part of our everyday therapeutic
snort
Initially with some of the psychotic patients we waited
••til they were well stabilized before sending them through
±4 course, but eventually patients were sent in acutely
>-. chotic states.
The EWI test was thought to be a sensitive indicator of
reality perception, and we found that the scores matched
zse clinical findings. Dr. El-Meligi confirmed that our clini-
cal observations were consistent with the changes reflected
ay the EWI scales. The only patient who became appre-
ciably more disturbed was the only one whose score became
appreciably worse. The ones whose scores dramatically im-
proved consistently showed remarkable clinical improvement
a well.
The authors of the EWI believe that the test is repeatable
tad can be given over and over again. We did not initially
est to see whether any of the changes noted were related
to some repeatability factor. We tried to give the test the
week before and the week after the training, but this was
•at always accomplished. More recently, in seven cases the
tost was given twice the week before and once the week
after, to determine whether there is any repeatability factor.
The ratio of "wrong" answers on the three tests was
100:92:65. Thus the difference between the first two tests190 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
was nominal compared with the change after the SMC
training.
Counterbalancing any repeatability factor is the fact that
there were many answers expected after but not neces-
sarily before the training that would earn negative points.
For example, two of the questions were "Can you read
persons' minds?" and "Have you had a religious experience
recently?" An affirmative answer to either earns a negative
point. The course teaches persons to function psychically,
and most persons become convinced they experience ESP;
and for some the experience is almost a religious one. Thus
we would have expected a worse performance after the
course instead of a better one.
Summarizing the reliability of the EWX a repeatability
factor was nominal and was counterbalanced by another
factor that caused a worsening of the score. The test was
thought to be sensitive and reliable, and results corre-
sponded with clinical evaluation as well as with how the
patients felt subjectively.
For the purpose of the study we decided that anyone
who became disturbed within a three-week period follow-
ing the course would be considered a casualty, whether or
not there were other factors contributing to the illness.
With any group of 75 highly disturbed patients followed
over a period of three weeks, we might expect one or more
to become more disturbed. This might happen even if they
are in treatment and not exposed to a regressive expe-
rience. The fact that all patients were in treatment at the
time of this study, and at times were given direction and
reassurance, undoubtedly was supportive and perhaps pre-
vented illnesses from occurring. But we believe that this
supportive therapy could not of itself account for the
dramatic positive changes that took place.
m
It is our experience that acute psychotic illness has an
early origin, with a pathological mother-infant relationship
Appendix II I 191
in the first two years of life, often reinforced by subse-
quent trauma. This predisposition requires a precipitating
factor in the person's current life situation to cause him to
regress and re-experience the feelings and reality of the
distant past Usually the precipitating factor is a severe
rejection or separation from an important person. The
cause is early. The precipitating factor is current. Beyond
this there may be a facilitating mechanism, such as hal-
kscinogenic drugs, contact with original family, and other
processes that foster regression. Thus we differentiate
among (1) origin or predisposition, (2) precipitating fac-
tor, and (3) facilitating mechanisms. Psychosis can be
Ekened to most natural processes that have an origin, a
triggering mechanism, and facilitating mechanisms.
All psychotics we have treated became ill as a result of a
rejection, separation, threatened loss (real or imagined),
diminished attention, etc., triggering an unconscious fear of
abandonment. In several hundred psychotic patients over
•-ie last ten years, the authors cannot recall any that did
aot experience some relative degree of loss or separation,
even if this was only implied. The twenty-nine-year-old
catatonic who became worse during the study, for example,
was in conflict with his mother, who he thought would
disapprove of his dating. This served as a precipitating
cause, triggering regression to age one, when he perceived
disapproval as impending abandonment and death.
If the Silva Mind Control course were to produce psy-
chosis in an individual, it would be acting as a facilitating
mechanism, which would have to be combined with a
precipitating cause in a vulnerable person. We cannot recall
Keing any patient whose psychotic process was produced
by a facilitating mechanism alone. Although we do not
doubt that this is possible, it must be relatively rare.
IV
What is Silva Mind Control?
Silva Mind Control is a forty-hour course consisting of
thirty hours of lecture and ten hours of mental exercises.192 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
The mental exercises not only teach persons how to relax
the mind and body, as do other approaches such as bio-
feedback and Transcendental Meditation, but they go one
step beyond. They teach persons how to function mentally
when they are at the relaxed level.
The entire course consists of techniques for using the
mind in beneficial ways. After experiencing this ourselves
and witnessing many others using it, we have no doubt
about the superior ability of the mind to function when the
person is using specific techniques in an alert relaxed state.
It is similar to the state Sigmund Freud described in his
paper on listening; like the state Brahms went into for
creating his compositions, or the state Thomas Edison de-
scribed for arriving at new ideas.
The course teaches a quick, easy method for going to
this level of relaxation at any time. Trainees practice visual-
izing, imagining, and thinking at this level of consciousness,
until they learn to function there mentally. They capture a
wider range of brain activity for conscious use. They have
an expanded range of consciousness. Instead of just day-
dreaming when they are relaxed, they can use their minds
effectively at that level. Instead of being in a light slumber,
they can have awareness and use of the mind at that level
too. Instead of just dreaming at night, they can use the
dream state to solve problems and arrive at answers the
mind is not capable of at any other time.
When persons learn to function mentally at the deeper
levels of relaxation of mind and body, creativity is en-
hanced. Memory is improved, and persons are better able
to solve problems. From the altered state, they are able to
direct the mind to do what they desire, and thus control of
such habits as smoking is made easier.
Continued practice at the relaxed level has an effect on
the thought processes of everyday life as well—i.e., per-
sons have access to their "level" without being there, like a
musician who no longer has to concentrate on the music
to know when a wrong note is played.
The mind has great capabilities, but at its normal level
of functioning it is constantly bombarded by various stimu-
Appendix II I 193
5 at once: thoughts, wishes, needs, desires, noises, lights,
pressures, conflicts, stresses of all sorts; it is not free to
• n e t more than ten percent of its attention to any one
'i ing. At the relaxed level it is. But persons ordinarily are
at that level only when they are falling asleep, and they
have not practiced using that level. Most often they do not
even know that it exists and can be used.
Once a person experiences the results obtained from this
level of consciousness, he never attempts to make impor-
tant decisions or solve problems without using it
The course most importantly teaches a person to use this
level of mind. In addition to teaching persons to think
while in the state of relaxation, the course teaches special
techniques for habit control, problem solving, goal achieve-
ment memorizing, health care, pain control, sleep and
iream control, etc.
Mind Control is not hypnosis; it more nearly approaches
self-hypnosis. Persons learn to get a fuller attention of the
mind, perhaps because it is no longer bombarded by as
many external stimuli when it is relaxed. With this fuller
attention, they are better able to direct the mind to do what
they want it to.
Another large portion of the course is learning to repeat
beneficial phrases to oneself while at this level of mind-
body relaxation. This is thought to have a powerful effect
Positive thinking is always valuable, but positive thinking in
the relaxed state is immeasurably more so.
The last portion of the course deals with parapsychology;
almost all persons report having ESP experiences during
the course. This is so common that Mind Control guar-
antees a full refund if trainees do not feel they have ex-
perienced clairvoyance on the last day.
V
Why does Mind Control help the mental patient?
Early in the study we stopped speculating on why Mind
Control might harm the mental patient and turned our at-
tention to why it helped.194 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
We do not know all the answers, but we think we are in a
better position to speculate than those who have not care-
fully evaluated patients before and after the training.
The mobilization of energy may be an important factor.
Freud said, in "Analysis Terminable and Interminable,"
that the effectiveness of a therapy of the future may depend
primarily on the mobilization of energy. Persons are highly
energized by the end of the course.
The positive attitude and optimism generated in the
course must have a beneficial effect on the patient Perhaps
telling oneself beneficial phrases while at the relaxed level
does effectively program the mind in a way that goes be-
yond simple positive thinking.
Relaxation diminishes anxiety and therefore decreases
symptomatology. A person cannot be in a relaxed state of
mind and body and be extremely anxious or conflicted at
the same time. Functioning at that level is thought to
produce the same carry-over effect of relaxation throughout
the day as noted in TM.
The mood of the Mind Control group is high, and per-
sons experience greater feelings of warmth and love while
at the relaxed level. Perhaps the love energy plays an im-
portant part Persons in love are generally not troubled by
things that might otherwise bother them.
Since persons at the relaxed level are not in as much con-
flict the early defenses of emotional distancing are not as
necessary. Therefore affect is improved. They are more in
touch with their feelings and more in touch with reality.
They have captured a wider range of brain activity for
reality testing. Perception is improved at the relaxed level
of mind and body, and clear thought and judgment are
enhanced.
Special techniques help patients to solve some of their
own problems, and they are able to program for relaxation
and better feeling to last throughout the day. To be able
to rely more on their own inner resources gives them more
confidence. The therapists trust the answers they get at the
altered state, and this adds to the patients' confidence.
A group phenomenon is present. The good emotional
Appendix II I 195
feeling of the group is contagious and carries over even to
the most disturbed.
The parapsychological part of the course helped some of
die disturbed patients in an unexpected way. Many who
were pushed to the outer reaches of the mind reported fre-
quent paranormal experiences that psychotherapy did not
explain. It was only in the parapsychological part of the
course that they gained understanding. One of the stated
purposes of deep psychotherapy is to make conscious what
was unconscious. Expanding the range of consciousness
and exploring the parapsychological aspects of the mind
served this very same purpose. Patients felt relieved to un-
cover this aspect of their mental processes and found it to
be real and accepted.
Because emotional illness helped them experience para-
normal phenomena, this added meaning to their prolonged
illnesses and meaning to their lives.
The therapist learned to apply Mind Control techniques
to psychotherapy, helping the patients further.
VI
Summary and Conclusions:
Seventy-five highly disturbed patients were sent through
Silva Mind Control training to determine which patients
might get into difficulty. Only one became appreciably
more disturbed. The most consistent finding was a dramatic
increase in reality perception, as determined clinically and
on objective psychological testing.
It is important to note that all the disturbed patients
from one psychiatric practice were asked to go through
the course, which meant that this was a complete sampling
from one psychiatric-patient population. No one was with-
held. Therefore the results do not apply to selected in-
dividuals only.
Silva Mind Control is not a psychotherapy. It can be
used as a tool in any psychotherapy, particularly if the
therapist is familiar with the course and not antagonistic
toward its concepts. It provides the patient with an en-196 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
hanced ability to use the mind and apply himself to what-
ever therapy he is in.
Psychotics have been helped so dramatically (at least
when the patient is in treatment and the psychiatrist under-
stands the course) that Dr. McKenzie now insists all his
psychotic patients attend, while under his care and super-
vision.
Because of the dramatic improvement in most of the
disturbed individuals, and because the training can be ap-
plied to large groups at once, the authors foresee an ap-
plication as an ancillary form of treatment in the hospital
setting.
The course was found to be safe and potentially bene-
ficial for neurotics. It was relatively safe and definitely
beneficial for the highly disturbed individual, when under
the care of a psychiatrist familiar with the program. Both
clinical and objective psychological data show that the
benefits far outweigh any negative effect

CHART Ai
Average difference in T scores before and after SMC train-
ing, for 38 women from the highly disturbed group.
There are improvements in all eleven scales, including the
euphoria scale. A lower score indicates improvement ex-
cept on the euphoria scale, where a higher score indicates
that the patient feels better and is more optimistic.
The scales are as follows: 1. Sensory perception consists
of items which describe the external world through direct
tense experience, utilizing all sensory modalities. 2. Time
perception samples phenomena related to subjective time
m four categories: change in experience of time flow:
temporal discontinuity; orientation, including mode of
engagement in past present and future; experiental age or
awareness of one's age and identification with or alienation
from one's generation. 3. Body perception covers three
aspects of experiencing one's body: emotive aspects, hypo-
chondriacal complaints, perceptual aspect 4. Self-percep-
tion includes emotive tendencies toward self-expression of
one's self-esteem and identity problems. J. Perception of
others is represented by five different patterns: dehumaniza-
bon of people, ascribing unusual powers to people, feelings
cf change, ideas of reference, anthropomorphic tendencies
in relating to animals. 6. Ideation focuses on pathology as
reflected in one's experience of his own thinking process
or its content and it deals with various categories such
as: deficit in thinking process, disorganization, change
m thinking habits or ideology, intellectual omnipotence,
change in rate of thinking, and presence of bizarre ideas.
7. Dysphoria taps three levels of dysphoric affect; somatic,
emotional, and intellectual. In addition, it contains items
concerned with death wishes and self-destructive tenden-
cies. 8. Impulse regulation contains herns emphasizing def-
icits of volition or will as an experience rather than actual
loss of control. The three classes of phenomena repre-
sented are: manifestations of hypertonicity; work inhibi-
tions and problems of decision making, compulsivity, and198 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
complete suspension of action; asocial, antisocial or bizarre
impulses.
