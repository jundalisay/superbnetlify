When you learn the memory techniques in the last chapter you will be well on your way to our next step, Speed Learning. 

Briefly, this is how you will progress: You will learn to enter the meditative level; then, at
that level, to create a mental screen, which is useful for
various purposes, one of which is to recall information.

Then, as a shortcut, you will learn the Three Fingers Technique for, among other things, instant recall. Once you have accomplished this you will be ready for new
ways of acquiring information, malting recall even
easier. 

Equally important, these new ways of learning will not only make recall easier but will both speed up
and deepen your understanding of what you learn.
There are two learning techniques. 

Let's start with the simpler, though not necessarily the easier, one.
The Three Fingers Technique, once it is so thorough-
ly mastered that you can instantly reach your level and
operate consciously there, can be used while you listen
to a lecture or read a book. 

This will vastly improve concentration, and information will be implanted more firmly. Later you will be able to recall it more easily at the Beta level and more easily still at the Alpha level. A student writing an exam with his 3 fingers together

can almost see the textbook he read, almost hear the instructor as he discussed the lesson in class.
The other technique is not as simple, but you will be ready for it earlier in your practice of Mind Control. It
has all the effectiveness of learning at the Alpha level
plus the added reinforcement of learning at Beta. 

You will need a tape recorder for this.

Let us say that you have a complex chapter of a textbook to learn; you must not only remember but under-
stand it. During the first step, do not go into Alpha but remain at outer consciousness, Beta. Read the chapter
aloud into the recorder. Now go to your level, play it back, and concentrate on your own voice as it recites
the material.

At an early stage of your Mind Control, particularly if you are not too familiar with the machine you are
using, you may flip back to Beta when you push the playback button and find that the sound of the tape
will make it more difficult to return to Alpha. 

By the time you do return, you will have missed part or all of the lesson. 

With practice, this is less likely to happen.

Here are a few tips:

Go to your level with your finger already on the
button. This will prevent your having to search for it
with your eyes open.

Have someone else press the playback for you when you give the signal. 

Use the Three Fingers Technique to speed up your re-entry into Alpha.

The problem may appear more serious than it is. In fact, it may actually be an indication of your progress.
As you become more adept, the Alpha level itself will begin to feel different. It will feel more and more like
Beta because you will be learning to use it consciously.

Being wide awake with full mental effectiveness while at Alpha is a special feature of Mind Control.
As you progress and recapture the earlier feeling of being at Alpha, you are really going to a deeper level,
perhaps Theta. 

In Mind Control classes, I have often seen graduates operating effectively at a deep level with
eyes open, fully as awake as you are now, speaking
clearly, asking and answering questions, cracking jokes.

Back to your tape recording: For added reinforcement, let some time pass, several days if possible, then
read the material again at Beta and play it back in Alpha.

The information will now be firmly yours.

If you are working with others in learning Mind Control with this book, you may exchange tapes in a
sort of division of labor to save time. 

This works perfectly well, though there is a slight advantage to listening to your own voice.

Speed Learning and the Three Fingers Technique have proved to be valuable time-savers for Mind Con-
trol graduates in a number of fields—sales (particularly
insurance), academic study, teaching, law, and acting
to name just a few.

A successful Canadian life insurance agent no longer exasperates his clients by riffling through the papers in
his briefcase to find answers to their questions about complex estate and tax problems. The tremendous array
of facts he needs are on the tip of his tongue, thanks to Speed Learning and his three fingers.

A trial lawyer in Detroit has "liberated" himself from notes when he sums up a complex case to a jury.

He records his summation and listens to it in Alpha the night before, then again early the next morning. Later,
when he stands confidently before the jurors, he maintains reassuring eye contact with them. The result is
that he speaks more persuasively than if he were consulting notes, and no one notices what he does with the
three fingers of his left hand. 

A New York night club comedian changes his routine every day; he "comments" on the news. 

An hour before show time he listens to a tape of himself and he is
ready with twenty minutes of "spontaneous" high humor. "I used to cross my fingers, hoping for the best.

Now I join three fingers and I know what's going to happen—lots of laughs."

Speed Learning and the Three Fingers Technique, of course, are ideal for students—one reason why Mind
Control has so far been taught in twenty-four colleges and universities, sixteen high schools, and eight grade
schools. Thanks to these techniques, thousands of students are studying less and learning more.
