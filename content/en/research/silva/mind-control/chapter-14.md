Detecting illnesses in persons you have never seen is astonishing enough, but we never let it go at that Into
the bodies where we project our awareness we also project healing.

Obviously there is an energy involved in mental projection, an energy aimed by the intentions of our minds.
Change these intentions from information gathering to healing and we change what the energy does.
How do we link our intentions to this energy so that it accomplishes what we want? The intention alone, in
its pure form, is something like the will. 

The will alone is of very little use. Just as we detect abnormalities by visualizing
them, we visualize conditions as we want them to be—
without the abnormalities. This is psychic healing. It's
as simple as that 

For most of the healing that you will want to do, it will not be necessary to master the technique of work-
ing cases. You can become an effective psychic healer simply by using your mental screen as you do in prob-
lem solving. In fact, even if you are in the early stages of meditation and visualization, you may still achieve
some effective results.

Many of life's possibilities hang in a precarious balance. One little push and you can tip this balance your
way. Sometimes, of course, the balance is already tipped and it takes a more accomplished psychic—
which you will become—to tip h back. 

If you wait until you are as effective at Mind Control as you would like to be before you begin psychic healing you will waste
priceless opportunities to provide needed help.

I began healing work long before I had developed Mind Control, and in fact long before I had an or-
ganized methodology for healing. I tried one method after another, with varying results. The important thing
is that I did not wait and a significant number of healings did take place—enough, in fact that I developed
a certain renown as a healer in my area of the U.S.-Mexican border. Many thought I had special gifts or
unusual powers; but I had simply read and experi-
mented until I got the hang of it.
One of my early healings shows how different my
methods used to be. In 1959 I heard about a parish
priest near Laredo who had suffered for fifteen years
from a painful swelling of the knees. He was often con-
fined to bed. The pain and confinement were not all
that troubled the priest; he was unable to kneel at
moments in the celebration of the Mass when kneeling
is called for. The Archbishop had granted him a dis-
pensation, but no dispensation could free the poor man
from the feeling that he was compromising a sacred
ritual.
I went to see him. "I think I can help you," I said.
"I am no doctor, but for the past twelve years I have
been working on parapsychology and we have obtained
results much like those of faith healing, with which you
are familiar."110 
As soon as I said the words "results much like those
of faith healing," the priest became more concerned for
me than for himself. Parapsychology?
"I have never heard of such a science. I trust you
are not getting into anything of which our Holy Church
would disapprove."
I explained, as best I could, some of the principles
of parapsychology I had learned and how healings can
be triggered. Nothing that I said seemed to mesh with
this man's theology. He promised to look into it further
and perhaps call me sometime soon. The look of com-
passion on his face and the sound of disbelief in his
voice gave me no hope at all that I would hear from
him again. I knew, though, that he would pray for my
protection from dangers so serious in his mind that they
dwarfed even his own plight.
I did hear from the priest a month later and once
again sat by his bedside.
"Jos6, as you know, the Lord leads us in strange
ways. A few days after your visit I received a circular
reviewing a book written by one of the brothers in our
order. I found a whole chapter devoted to this para-
psychology you were explaining to me the other day.
Now I understand this a little better and I am willing to
let you try your work on me."
I sat with him for over an hour and spoke of my
reading and some of the work I had done. The longer I
remained, the more I liked the man. Finally he grew
tired and it was time to leave.
"All right then," he said, "when shall we start the
treatment?"
"Father, it has already started."
"But I don't understand."
"This thing is mental, Father, and while we were
talking I have done the initial work."
I did the rest of the work at home that night The

next morning the priest was on the telephone and with
surprise and joy in his voice reported mat a great im-
provement had taken place during the night
Three days after my visit he could walk and kneel,
and he has never since experienced discomfort in his
knees. A miracle? No, a purely natural phenomenon.
Here is how I did it
Daring the more-than-an-hour chat we were both
alert and relaxed, two conditions helpful in healing.
The subjects we discussed gave him added confidence
in parapsychology. In psychic work, confidence is as
important as faith is in religion. Meanwhile I began to
visualize him in better health and, just as important
learned to like him more and more. Love is a tremen-
dous power; I wanted that on our side, too.
I did one more thing in preparation for what I would
later do that night. To help visualize him later, I studied
the priest—his face, the feel of his handshake, his
various expressions and mannerisms, the sound of his
voice, the overall feeling of being in his presence. This
was the "initial work."
Several hours later, when the priest was asleep and I
was back home, I did the rest of the job. What I did
was totally different from what I do now. I had learned
that psychic energies are transferred most effectively
when survival is at stake, as I mentioned in die last
chapter. Instead of going to my level, as I would to-
day, I held my breath while picturing the priest in per-
fect health. Long minutes went by, until my body
screamed for breath. Still I held on to my image of the
priest in perfect health. Meanwhile my brain, in a sort
of psychic scream, cried out and the energy of the
scream carried the carefully held image of perfect health
exactly where it was supposed to go.
Finally I breathed, convinced the job was done, and
it was. The method I teach and use today is much112 
easier on the operator and just as effective. Simply
learn to use the mental screen vividly, with confidence.
Let me outline the procedure for you, step by step.
1. It is helpful, though not necessary, to know the
condition of the person you are about to heal. You can
learn this psychically or objectively; it does not matter.
2. Go to your meditative level and project this per-
son onto your mental screen as he is, with whatever
ailment is troubling him. Place another image on the
screen to the left, showing something being done to
correct the problem. (If you have not met the person
and are not yet ready for case work, try to learn before-
hand what he looks like to make your visualization as
accurate as possible.)
3. Now project onto the screen—still farther left—a
vivid image of the person in perfect health, filled with
energy and optimism. In deep meditation you are acute-
ly receptive to what you say to yourself. This particular
moment is crucial to developing a conviction that the
happy image you now have of the person is the real one
—not that it is becoming real or that it will be real,
but that it is real. The reason for this is that at this
meditative level, at Alpha and Theta, your mind is in
league with causes; at Beta it deals more with results.
By visualizing with conviction in Alpha and Theta you
are causing. Never mind what you seem to be doing to
time by substituting "is" for "will be." Time is some-
thing else at this level. Visualize the results you want
as being already achieved.
Among the laws of the universe there seems to be a
sort of cosmic Bill of Rights which guarantees that all
of us, no matter how high or low, no matter how bright
or dull, can take part in causing lawful things to hap-
pen through the firmness of our desire, belief, and ex-

pectancy. This was said earlier, and better, almost 2,000
years ago, as reported by Mark in the New Testament:
"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ye shall receive them."
While you visualize this person in perfect health
there will come an instant, a very pleasant one, when
you know that you have done enough. It is pleasant
because it is a feeling of accomplishment Count your-
self out to Beta, one to five, "feeling wide awake and
better than before."
The more you practice this technique, the more
beautiful coincidences will occur and the more firm will
be your belief, which in turn will produce even more
beautiful coincidences. As soon as you learn to use
your mental screen you can begin to spark this chain
reaction.
While the techniques of faith and psychic healing
may be different I believe their principles—and results
—are the same. Rituals of faith healing differ from one
culture to another, but they have the same twofold ef-
fect: to induce a deeper level of mind, and to buttress
belief and expectation.
Many healers use methods which exhaust them. They
are drained of energy and sometimes lose weight in a
single sitting. This is not necessary. In fact Mind Con-
trol methods have the opposite effect Once we sense
that feeling of accomplishment we experience a lift—
not a subde one; it is quite strong—and we do awaken
"feeling better than before." Healing others, we find, is
good for the healer.
Many healers believe they cannot heal themselves.
Some feel that if they even try this they will lose their
"power." We have proved this to be untrue, over and
over. Many also believe they must be in the presence of
the person they are healing for the "laying on of hands."
For those of us who are not licensed physicians or of-114 
ficials of recognized churches, this is illegal. More im
portant in terms of larger laws, it is unnecessary. Ab-
sent healing works.

In discussing this in Mind Control classes, we often
cite the case of the Centurion's servant whom Christ
healed at a distance. Christ did not see the servant, only
the Centurion who told Him of the problem. "And his
servant was healed in the selfsame hour."
One small observation: Notice that in our folklore,
when we make a wish—with a wishbone or when we
see a star fall or when we blow out birthday candles—
we are admonished not to reveal our wish. This secrecy
is probably more than mere child's play; I think there
is some wisdom behind it. Keeping our wish—or, more
to the point, our visualization of a healing—bottled up
in secrecy seems a way to avoid dissipating its energy,
maybe even to add to its energy. For this reason, I and
many of our lecturers advise students to keep their
healing work to themselves. When Christ said after one
of His healings, "See that no man know of it," He was
not asking for a cover-up; His reasons were deeper.
