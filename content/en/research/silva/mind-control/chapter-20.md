From the moment of your first accomplishment with  Mind Control you will be launched on an odyssey of
self-discovery. What you learn about yourself will be all good news. Finally, when you have made everything
work for you as Jose has described in his chapters, several paths for future development will be open to
you.

You may, through books or friends or other courses, try out still more techniques and add to the mental
tools at your disposal. On the other hand, you may find that even a miracle repeated over and over becomes
commonplace and, with the excitement of your new discoveries fading, you may slack off and drift back to
where you were at the outset Or, finding that one Mind Control technique works better for you than others, you
may specialize in that one and make it a reliable part of your life.

None of these paths is the best for you. 

If you begin a search for other techniques, you will find many that work. Chances are, the ones you find
have already been researched by Jose and set aside in favor of those now in his course. Those who become
technique collectors take time away from developing a 163164 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
few useful ones to the point of mastery. More on this later.


If you find that your excitement dims and you drift away from practicing Mind Control, you will not be
alone. More important, your experience will not be a total loss. Jos6 has observed that, once acquired, Mind
Control training is never completely lost and can be recalled and put to use in an emergency.

What many Mind Control graduates do is settle for one particular technique that works best for them. The
more they use it, the better the results. 

However, there is a fourth way better than any of these three.
Mind Control is a very careful selection of mental exercises and techniques that reinforce each other. To
ignore one because it does not work as well for you as
another is to pass up the opportunity of truly full
development. Dream Control reinforces your ability
with the Mental Screen; the Mental Screen makes
Dream Control more reliable and vivid. The course,
and Josh's chapters here, are all of a piece; the whole
is much greater than the parts.
Still, you may wonder where you go next when you
have practiced it all and made it work.
Simply making Mind Control work is not enough.
There are always degrees of control, subtleties of ex-
perience ahead of you.
A student once asked Jos6, "At what point does a
person know he has gotten out of Mind Control every-
thing there is to get?"
"When you can convert all your problems into proj-
ects and make your projects work out the way you
want them to," he answered. Then he paused a mo-
ment and added, "No . . . it goes deeper than that
When you realize what enormous powers we were all
born with, when you see in your own experience that
these powers can only be used constructively, you come

to realize that there is a dignity and a purpose behind
our presence on this planet My own opinion is that
the purpose we must serve is to evolve, and this evolu-
tion is now our own, individual responsibility. I think
most people have a kind of weak hunch about this. The
more you practice Mind Control, the stronger this
hunch becomes until it becomes a firm certainty."
It is this depth of experience that awaits you—the
"firm certainty" that there is a benign purpose behind
everything. In Mind Control, this comes not as a mys-
tical flash after years of life-renouncing meditation, but
quite soon, out of the daily business of living more ef-
fectively—from the everyday details of life as well as
its destiny-shaping events.
Let's take a very small incident the kind a new Mind
Control graduate might experience, and we will see how
it becomes a step toward building this "firm certainty."
The first thing a recent graduate did on returning home
from vacation was to remove the film from his camera
and then search his luggage for another roll of exposed
film. He could not find it The film was not a great loss,
but an annoying one; it was a record of the first week
of his vacation.
He went to his level and relived the moment he last
put film in his camera; but all he saw on his Mental
Screen was the camera itself on his coffee table, where
he had put the first roll in, not the second. He stayed
at his level and went from one picture-taking moment
to another, but still no scene of bis reloading the cam-
era. Stubbornly, the coffee-table scene kept reappearing.
Convinced that his Mental Screen had failed, he
turned in the one roll of film for developing. When it
came back it contained all the photographs he had
taken, from the beginning to the end of his vacation.
There never was a second roll.
As small as this incident was, it provided the grad-166 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
uate with the first concrete reason he had encountered
outside the class for having more confidence in his own
mind. With a few more small incidents like this, then
several major ones in which he helps not only himself
but someone else as well, his view of himself and the
world around him will change. His life will be changed
because he will be on the brink of that firm certainty.
Along the way, he may achieve something like the
following: A graduate who had been practicing Mind
Control for several months had a daughter who was
allergic to his family's two cats. Whenever she played
with them she wheezed uncomfortably and broke out
in a rash. He put the problem, then imagined the solu-
tion, on his Mental Screen during his meditations for
about a week. The solution he imagined was his daugh-
ter playing with their cats, breathing easily, with no
rash. One day he saw in real life what he had been
imagining. His daughter was no longer allergic to cats.
Both these cases involved the Mental Screen alone.
They were both successful, so, you might ask, why
bother with other techniques?
In the first case, if the graduate had learned nothing
except how to use his Mental Screen, it is just possible
that he would have achieved the same results—assum-
ing that he had simply triggered the recall of a "forgot-
ten" fact and that Higher Intelligence did not come into
play, which is far from certain.
However, the second case involved a broad range of
Mind Control training—going to level, visualization ex-
ercises, Effective Sensory Projection for the telepathic
transmission of healing, Dream Control, and case work-
ing, so that he could add a full measure of expectancy
to his desire and belief.
With extensive practice, your mind will begin to take
short-cuts. It will become sensitive to faint signals on
important matters and will pass them on to you without

your having to search for them. One Mind Control
graduate's life may have been saved this way. She was
meditating one morning just before going to work, using
her Mental Screen to correct a small office problem,
when a large black X blocked out the scene she was
trying to create. Then it blocked out all other scenes
connected with her office. A "hunch" too strong to ig-
nore told her to avoid her office that day, and she
happily stayed home. Later she learned that if she had
gone to the office that day she would have walked into
an armed robbery in which several persons were badly
injured. This is the kind of information we would nor-
mally get with Dream Control, but the Mental Screen
was what she was using and that is where it came
through.
Here is another case, in which the mind was so
trained that in a serious emergency it was brought under
control by a graduate without taking time to go into
Alpha. Many of the events described in the following
letter were attested to by nine witnesses.
Wednesday, I came home from shopping, my
arms loaded with bags. I opened the screen door,
which swung back on me before I could open the
inside door. Impatiently, I gave the door a hard
push. To my horror, it slammed back fast, and the
pointed door handle stuck in my arm below the
elbow. I dropped the bags and slowly pulled the
handle out of my arm. I could see down through
layers and layers of tissue into a deep hole.
Then blood started to well up, filling the hole,
flowing over. I didn't have time to feel faint In-
stead, I concentrated intensely on stopping the
bleeding. A great surge of joy shot through me
when the bleeding stopped—I could barely be-
lieve my eyesl168 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
While I was washing and cleansing the wound,
the first pains came. I sat down and went to my
level, trying to find out whether I should cancel a
trip to Boston to hear Major Thompson at a Mind
Control meeting and go to a doctor instead. But I
felt a strong urge to go to Boston, also a strong
urge to test my belief in having learned to control
pain.
I worked on my pain incessantly on the way to
Boston. But during the lecture it became so severe
and my fingers so numb that even at my level I
could hardly stand it. I felt guilty that I couldn't
listen to the lecture—yet next day I was able to
repeat it almost word for word.
While in such severe pain, I kept calling for help
psychically over and over. Martha must have heard
my cry because, after the lecture, as people wan-
dered over to the coffee table, she insisted on
seeing my "cut." When I raised the bandage, the
wound was still gaping open. A piece of flesh had
been somewhat dislodged when I pulled out the
handle, and the skin around it was purplish black.
She went for help and, having found out where
the nearest hospital was, came back with Dennis
Storin. I said I did not want to go to the hospital.
I wanted Dennis to work on it, so we withdrew to
a quiet corner where Dennis went to his level.
Once he started to work on the wound, my pain
became so intense that I had to go to my level to
work on it, too. As he began knitting the broken
tissue together bit by bit, his fingers seemed to
draw out the pain in huge waves. The wound be-
came so sensitive I felt like screaming! I tried to
concentrate on making the pain go away and on
sending help to Dennis and to myself, over and
over and over again—successfully combating the

urge, undoubtedly conceived in Beta, to tell him to
stop and let me go to an accident room. I really
wanted it to work.
And, after hours, it seemed, I could feel the pain
begin to subside. First, I felt about ten percent less
pain, then about fifteen percent. When Dennis
asked how it was, about a quarter of the pain had
gone.
As we continued, the inner tissues mended.

Then, as the outer layers began to mend, the pain became even more intense. Despite my concentra-
tion on the healing, I was slightly conscious of people moving around me—especially of someone
standing behind me, taking away some of the pain when I needed it most desperately. I felt so grate-
ful Then the next waves started, and I had to concentrate hard on coping with them.
Then we worked on closing the deepest part of the wound. I felt people forming a circle around us
to give us strength. I could feel the energy surging through me—it almost lifted me off the chair.
Dennis could feel it, too, and with the help of the others, the healing progressed much faster.
Some of those in the circle later told me that they could see the wound closing, the swelling going
down, the skin turning from an unhealthy purple to reddish^purple, to red, to pink, and, finally, the
two outer layers of skin coming together like the well-cut pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 

When we got back to where my car was parked, my friends wanted to drive me to Warwick—they didn't want the wound to open up when I used my arm on the stick shift of the car. But I refused. I knew I would get home safely. And so I did—with absolutely no pain!

Next morning, I woke up in fine shape. My arm felt as if I had been in a fight—I've never been beaten up, but I imagine it must feel like that!

But there was no pain, and my arm looked great I sat up in bed and saw our beautiful world bathed in brilliant sunshine. I felt as if I had been reborn!

As you can see, if you continue to explore the potentials of your mind, it will pay off in priceless ways. 

In this respect says Dr. J. Wilfred Hahn, Mind Control's Director of Research, every Mind Control graduate becomes his own director of research.

"In what other field of research," he asked, "are expensive laboratories and sophisticated equipment so un-
necessary? The most sophisticated research tool ever developed—one so remarkable that I am in awe whenever I think of it—is at your disposal and mine 24 four hours a day: our minds. We are all, therefore, directors of research."

One important advantage that we have now is that for the first time in the history of modern science, psychic research is becoming respectable. The danger of a serious investigator being put down as an irresponsible crackpot as Jose" was in his early days, is vastly reduced.

This danger, however, is not entirely behind us.

There are physicians learning to use Mind Control in
their practice, industrial scientists who use Dream Control to put them on the track of new products, men and
women in all walks of life—some mentioned anonymously in this book—who say, "Don't use my name. My friends will think I'm crazy." 

This is becoming more and more rare. Hundreds of thousands of Mind Control graduates proudly speak of what they are accomplishing with their training. Respected medical journals carry scientific and clinical papers on psychic heeling and mind-body interactions.

Men and women in the public eye—members of the Chicago White Sox and performing artists such as Carol Lawrence and Marguerite Piazza (mentioned earlier), Larry Blyden, Celeste Holm, Loretta Swit, Alexis Smith, and Vicki Can*—all these have spoken out publicly of their Mind Control experiences.

Where do we go from here? Down a long path of exciting self-discovery. 

With each new finding yoti will
be closer to the goal of the ultimate research project
spelled out for us by William Blake:
To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.
