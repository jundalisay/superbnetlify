"We waste too much of our time dragging ourselves under. 

If we spent one half of it just researching in our mind how to deal with life, we'd find we're so much
stronger than we think," singer-actress Carol Lawrence was quoted as saying in the Chicago Tribune, Novem-
ber 14, 1975. She became a Mind Control graduate on the recommendation of another graduate, singer Mar-
guerite Piazza.

True, most of us are imprisoned by narrow ideas of who we are and what we can do. You will soon ex-
perience the exhilaration of smashing these confines and
finding new freedoms outside them. When you see what
you are capable of, your self-esteem will soar. 

A number of studies have been made of this, and the results
are in. 

They cover large groups with no special problems as well as others whose self-esteem is obviously in
shambles—students as well as alcoholics, drug addicts,
prisoners, and the welfare poor.

Let us look first at students. Mind Control has been taught, often as a full-credit course, in twenty-four col-
leges and universities, sixteen high schools, and eight
elementary schools.

You might expect that the same course taught the same way in different schools to students of different ages and different cultural and economic backgrounds would achieve different results. Not so—the results
have been so uniform that it can now be safely claimed
that in basic respects they are predictable. 

Introduce Mind Control in a school and the result will be students with more powerful self-direction, greater self-
goidance sternming from improved ability to solve problems on their own. In other words, greater ego strength.
This has been scientifically measured by Dr. George De Sau, former Director of Educational Research for Silva
Mind Control and previously Director of Counseling and Testing at the Williamsport (Pennsylvania) Area
Cornmunity College.

The first test, in 1972, was at Hallahan High School in Philadelphia, where 2,000 students took the course.
A week before and two weeks after, 220 randomly selected students were given the High School Person-
ality Questionnaire,* which consists of some 140 ques-
tions that sensitively measure a person's self-image.
His total self-image can then be drawn up as a sort
of portrait with fourteen characteristics—adventurous,
zestful, self-assured, and so on. The test is widely used
in research and counseling.

The self-image portraits of these 220 students were] combined into a single group profile, then compared
before and after. Results: major shifts toward higher ego strength, self-assurance, and composure, and away
from impatience, insecurity, and detachment. 

In some respects students remained unchanged—as in balance between dominance and submissiveness, tender- and
tough-rnindedness. What all this added up to was that these students had greater respect for themselves after
Mind Control than they had before.

Naturally, with life's changing patterns, our view of
 <!-- Published by the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing.140  -->
ourselves changes from day to day. If we gave the test to a randomly selected group and then repeated it three
weeks later, we would find some changes. This too has been studied by those who developed the test The ran-
dom changes that would occur by chance are a normal expectation, and their rate has been calculated. To
evaluate the results at Hallahan High, it was necessary to determine by how much the reported changes ex-
ceeded those that chance alone could produce. 

Here is what was found:

For chance to produce positive changes in ego strength as great as those brought about by Mind Con-
trol at Hallahan High, the test would have to be given more than a thousand times to a randomly selected
group—more than a thousand times to match the change in self-assurance, more than a thousand times
to match the change in composure. What made the dif-
ference was not chance but Mind Control.
While the course was in progress, a Philadelphia
Daily News reporter, Joe Clark, interviewed some stu-
dents during a lunch break. In an article that appeared
September 27,1972, he quoted thirteen-year-old Kathy
Brady, who had been biting her nails since she was
eight: "I always bit them when I got nervous. When I
was in the auditorium this morning I felt like biting
them, but I didn't I just thought to myself, Don't bite
your nails.' I closed my eyes and relaxed."
Pat Eisenlohr told him she had passed up a fight with
her younger brother, something that had hardly ever
happened before. "I told myself, There's no use in
getting mad. Why fight?' I d i d n t I also got rid of a
headache this morning by telling myself to get rid of it
I know it sounds weird, but it works."
Now let's compare results at this school with two
other studies, one at Lawrenceville, a co-ed Catholic
high school in Pittsburgh, and the other at St Fidelis,
Your Self-Esteem Will Soar I 141
a Catholic high school for men planning to become
priests.
At Lawrenceville and St Fidelis, as at Hallahan, the
greatest change among the students was in ego strength.
What's more, this change was uniform—in each school
the group profile improved to a degree that could have
occurred by chance alone only once in a thousand
times. The same degree of change occurred in com-
posure at Hallahan and Lawrenceville, though less at
St Fidelis. Varying degrees of change in self-assurance,
though all sharply positive, occurred at all three
schools.
The findings of which the above are a part did not
fully satisfy Dr. De Sau. Although he was cheered by
the positive results and reassured by the uniform pat-
tern of benefits from Mind Control, something was
missing. Tests of a group before, then two weeks after
Mind Control training do not indicate whether these
benefits are of lasting value. Testing four months after
the training would.
Dr. De Sau did this at Lawrenceville and St. Fidelis;
he faced some surprises. In all the above characteristics
—ego strength, self-assurance, composure—the students
of both schools improved far more over the four-month
period than they had during the two weeks immediately
following the course!
In his report on these studies, Dr. De Sau con-
cluded:
Perhaps the changes which took place with the
above students in their various educational settings
can best be evaluated from a perspective such as
that held by John Holt, educator and author. It is
Holt's position that the educational process has
often been one of teaching stupidity through con-
tributing to the increasing of anxiety, guilt, and142 
almost continuous reliance upon the external en-
vironment for approval or disapproval—all the
conditions which may produce conforming, neu-
rotic, robopathic behavior but do little to enhance
education or human growth. There are reasonable
grounds to believe the same conditions are found
in other societal institutions.
The research data above indicate, at least from
the educational perspective, a refreshing, viable
alternative. A factor of change which is persistent
and strong after Mind Control training is that of a
shifting to internal points of reference—another
way of saying the recognition by an individual of
his own value and a significant step toward self-
control as opposed to being controlled by external
others.
In most schools where Mind Control is taught, teach-
ers are urged to take ft, too. The reasons—all except
one—are obvious enough, considering the benefits of
the training. The teachers become less flappable, more
patient, far easier for students to spend their class hours
with.
It is well known that a teacher who expects less from
students gets less, and one who expects more gets
more. The teacher trained in Mind Control has had
firsthand experience with what in Chapter 14 Jose calls
the "cosmic Bill of Rights," with its humanity-wide
jurisdiction. No teacher with this training can ever
again scoff at anyone's "mental equipment"—he knows
the vast scope of every human mind too well for that.
He is a better teacher as a result, even if his students
have never heard of Mind Control.
However, when the students and the teacher are
Mind Control graduates, great things happen in the
classroom.
Your Self-Esteem Will Soar I 143
One grade-school teacher in Buffalo teaches her stu-
dents to "tune in" to George Washington and other
figures of the past to help them study history, using
techniques they learned in the final hours of Mind Con-
trol, when they worked cases. This way they experience
history. And to help them later, when they take tests,
they tune in to her and find confirmation of their an-
swers.
Another teacher, this one on the college level, has
her students tune in to philosophers for explanations of
points they find obscure in their writings. "It works!"
she says.
Mrs. Joe Lytle, a Mind Control lecturer in Virginia
Beach, takes special delight in teaching youngsters from
ages seven to seventeen. Some of her experiences were
reported in the Ledger-Star of Norfolk (July 16, 1975)
under the headline "Students Excel After Course in
Mind Control." One of her students was on medication
for hyperkinesis. The mother of this overactive young-
ster is quoted as saying, "The changes were absolutely
fantastic after the course. My son was able to stop tak-
ing the medicine and his grades went from C's to A's.
Mind Control gave him the knowledge that he had the
power to change."
Another student's grades in junior high school jumped
from C's before the course to A's after it. Still an-
other was failing her spelling tests. After the course
she made A's on all her spelling tests, and in one year
her reading ability jumped from fourth- to ninth-grade
leveL
There was no practical way to compare those who
chose to take the course with those who did not, or to
measure the difference between the two groups after-
ward, because at the three high schools where Dr. De
Sau conducted the before and after tests virtually all
the students signed up for Mind Control.144 
This opportunity came, however, at the University of
Scranton, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Professor Donald
L. Angell of the Department of Human Resources of-
fered the course to graduate students in Rehabilitation
Counseling. Enough students decided not to take the
course to permit him and Dr. De Sau to study some
differences. They gave a test similar to the one used at
the high schools—though designed for adults—to 35
students who took the course and 35 who did n o t
Differences between the two groups showed up even
before the course. Those who elected to take it were,
according to test results, more open to experience and
more inner-directed. Those who did not want the
course were more traditional, rule-bound, and practical
A month after the course, the two groups were
tested again and, while the original differences re-
mained, other significant ones had cropped up: The
Mind Control group was more emotionally stable and
mature, more self-assured, more relaxed than the other.
In short, this study suggests that those who choose
to take Mind Control are different from those who do
n o t and that once they take it they benefit
While a boost to self-esteem is important to every-
one, it can be of life-saving importance to the drug
addict fighting his way to freedom from this addiction.
Mind Control has limited experience with drug addicts,
but the experience has proved instructive.
Paul Grivas, co-director of the Mind Control Center
in Manhattan, wanted to see what Mind Control could
do for the addicted. He volunteered to start with four
addicts, two of them on methadone, two still on heroin.
The two on methadone found the course useful but it
did not free them from methadone. Methadone is highly
addictive and is used in many drug programs to free
the addicts from heroin. To withdraw from methadone
Your Self-Esteem Will Soar I 145
is physically painful and the pains, these addicts said,
were so severe that they could not concentrate on their
Mind Control exercises.
One of the addicts still on heroin faced a family
crisis the first day of the course and dropped out. The
remaining one was able to detoxify himself—to become
free of the drug for several months after the course.
Then he telephoned Mr. Grivas to report that he was
back on heroin. He asked to repeat the course. Mr.
Grivas spent a day with him to reinforce his Mind Con-
trol training, and again he became free of the drug.
Months later he was still free; then he moved away
and Mr. Grivas lost touch with him.
The second effort to help addicts through Mind Con-
trol was at a community project in the Bronx, with
eighteen former addicts, some of whom were adminis-
trators and staff of the project itself. Those who took the
course said they felt far more in control of themselves
than ever before, and several of them, months later,
reported they were even able to pass on some of their
training to their families. Reliable testing before and
after was not possible because three months later many
of the original eighteen were no longer available.
Has anything been learned from these two experi-
ences? Yes, says Paul Grivas. While there is not yet
statistical proof, his experience indicates two things:
First Mind Control should not enter an addict's life
for forty-eight hours and then leave the rest up to him.
For most of us it is a permanently transforming ex-
perience, but for the addict with years, perhaps a life-
time, of strong negative conditioning to overcome, plus
a mental and physical addiction, a greatly extended
period of frequent reinforcement is necessary. "Give
me a drug rehabilitation program where I can do this,"
Grivas says, "and I'm sure 111 get results."
Second, difficult as drug addiction is to overcome,146 
the addict takes more easily to Mind Control training
than do many others. The reason, Mr. Grivas believes,
is that Mind Control involves an altered state of con-
sciousness. While most people have never altered their
consciousness, the drug addict has done it often. What
he has not done before is enter a useful level of mind
where he gains control instead of losing it. This is where
Mind Control holds special promise for the addict
Although there have been no extensive studies in
this area, there are frequent enough success stories from
individual graduates to suggest that Mr. Grivas' con-
fidence in Mind Control is well founded.
Here is one from a graduate who cured his own ad-
diction in 1971. He is still "clean."
I knew I had a serious problem: an addiction to
heroin. How a course called Mind Control, which
claimed among other things to help people elimi-
nate undesired habits, was going to help me when I
had already tried most drug rehabilitation methods
was beyond my present level of understanding.
Skeptical as I was, after going to psychiatrists,
psychotherapists, methadone programs, and hos-
pitals, I was willing to try anything! I was con-
vinced I would not stay alive the three more years
to my thirtieth birthday unless I stopped heroin
use and the lifestyle it required to obtain up to
$200 a day worth of drugs.
"A habit is nothing more than impressions on
brain cells that have been reinforced by repeti-
tion," said the Mind Control instructor. "Change
•the programming at the cause level, the subcon-
scious mind," he continued, "and you change the
behavior patterns at the effect level, the outer con-
scious dimension." It made sense to me logically
but my emotional levels were telling me I needed
Your Self-Esteem Will Soar I 147
to use drugs to desensitize myself to life and the
negative feelings I had about myself. Then the in-
structor gave us a technique for changing our self-
image from a weak, no-willpower, ineffective
person to a confident, self-reliant, healthy-self-
imaged human being.
Still skeptical, but with a glimmer of hope, I
began to change myself in my imagination at the
"Alpha" level. I programmed myself three times a
day, morning, noon, and night, that by July 20,
which was thirty days from the date of my initial
programming, all desire for drugs would disappear
forever. During the thirty days, I continued to use
drugs but decreased the amount used slowly, plan-
ning it so that I would be off drugs completely by
my target date.
On that great day in July I stopped using drugs
and have never used them since. It was not at all
like the many times before, when I would stop
using drugs only to return a few days or weeks
later. This time my "gut" feeling was I genuinely
had no desire for drugs. No willpower, no substitu-
tions, no suppressing of feelings and desires. It
worked! Free at last!
Alcoholism, another addiction, is far more wide-
spread than drug addiction and darkens many more
lives—millions of them in the U.S. alone. Its victims
also have a desperate need to overcome feelings of
helplessness, failure, and guilt, to build self-confidence
and composure to ease their return to health.
These needs were met when IS alcoholics took Mind
Control in 1973 as part of a research project at a half-
way house where they were under treatment. The re-
sults were measured by Dr. De Sau. He administered
the same personality test he had used earlier with the148 
graduate students at the University of Scranton and,
as in the earlier study, he gave it once immediately be-
fore and again a month after the course.
The sharpest contrast between these 15 persons be-
fore the course and after it was in manipulative be-
havior. There was a shift in the group profile away from
sly control of events toward greater candor and open-
ness in the pursuit of goals, a shift which chance would
produce only one time in a hundred times. Other
changes generally followed the pattern seen among the
high-school and graduate students described earlier.
They had greater ego strength and self-assurance, were
more relaxed and open to new experiences—all qual-
ities of priceless value to anyone struggling for freedom
from alcohol.
One of the most significant changes was a reduction
in "threat sensitivity," or anxiety. Dr. De Sau wrote,
T h e area of threat sensitivity, with its high autonomic
tenseness and overactivity, may be of considerable im-
portance in understanding the behavior of the alcoholic.
It is very possible that alcoholics use alcohol as a means
of attempting to balance out their mental/physical
symptoms. Alcohol as a response to balance the mind/
body in a threat situation could provide relief from
that anxiety level. An improved self-concept and ability
to handle anxiety would seem to be a meaningful al-
ternative to alcohol."
The director of the halfway house reported how each
of the 15 new Mind Control graduates was doing six
months later. (To preserve their privacy, they are
simply referred to as "subject," or "S," rather than by
name.)
Subject 1: No relapse since undergoing a 90-day
rehabilitation program. S since taking the Mind Control
course has progressed from a very passive, withdrawn
Your Sell-Esteem Will Soar I 149
individual to an affable, outgoing, and dry-witted hu-
morist
Subject 2: Since taking Mind Control, S has not ex-
perienced any relapses and has left the residency and
treatment program at the halfway house. It seems that S
is developing a sense of well-being and confidence in
self.
Subject 3: No relapses since undergoing rehabilita-
tion treatment in hospital program. Since the Mind Con-
trol course S has experienced definite progress in A.A.
program.
Subject 4: No relapses since hospitalization prior to
taking Mind Control. The Mind Control course has
very definitely reinforced his therapeutic treatment pro-
gram.
Subject 5: No relapse has been experienced by S
since discharge from hospital rehabilitation program.
Subject 6: No relapses. The S's sense of well-being
is very definitely improving. Improvement is reflected
in an apparent stabilization of his entire family. His
grades in college have also improved.
Subject 7: To date S has not experienced any re-
lapses. After Mind Control course, S discontinued A.A.
program. However, it is evident that he is living the
A.A. philosophy. Family relations are also seemingly
improving.
Subject 8: No relapses since taking the Mind Control
course. Family relations have vastly improved. S has
changed from a caustic, angry type of individual to an
affable "Love thy neighbor" temperament
Subject 9: The subject, a female, has had no relapses
and is presently employed.
Subject 10: No relapse. S is now goal-oriented and
has definitely altered self-imposed limitations and is
looking for opportunities for higher achievement
Subject 1 1 : Since taking Mind Control, S has stated150 
his life has progressively become better, which is evident
in the sense of well-being exhibited by his family and
in his work record. No relapses have been experienced
byS.
Subject 12: Twelve years in A.A. program. Since
taking Mind Control, S has had one brief relapse of
less than one hour's duration. No subsequent relapses.
Subject 13: No relapses since discharge from hospital
rehabilitation program. Since Mind Control, S is pro-
gressively "getting it all together." Improvement is noted
in areas such as work, family, etc.
Subject 14: Since taking the Mind Control course, S
has had several relapses, from all of which he has
recovered on his own. He has not been hospitalized for
any of these relapses as was the case prior to taking
Mind Control.
Subject 15: Eight years on and off A. A. program.
Hospitalized four times prior to taking the Mind Con-
trol course. Intermittent slips or relapses during this in-
terim. Since taking the Mind Control course, S has
experienced four relapses, two of them requiring brief
hospitalizations.
Mind Control was obviously a powerful boost in the
struggles of all but the last of these 15 alcoholics.
This one small study, of course, is not enough to
prove that Mind Control should now be accepted as an
integral part of the alcoholic's treatment. However, the
improved sense of well-being that has turned up so
uniformly in before and after tests on students and psy-
chiatric patients clearly suggests that those looking for
better ways to help the alcoholic should give Mind
Control a try.
There is another condition that involves shattered
self-esteem, not as self-imposed as drug or alcohol ad-
Your Self-Esteem Will Soar I 151
diction, but even more widespread—poverty. Causes of
poverty and the remedies for it have been debated for
as long as there have been human societies. Mind Con-
trol does not enter this debate, but it can be of im-
mense help in persuading the poor to rally their
strengths and help themselves.
This may sound to some as if the debate has already
been entered—as if in persuading the poor to help
themselves we are assuming that they are to blame for
their own poverty. This is obviously untrue, but every
poor person can help himself break out of bis confines
when he finds in Mind Control what all others find,
greater ability to control his own life.
The first serious effort to find out how useful, if at
all, Mind Control might be as part of a rehabilitation
program in social work was a study of 41 men and
women on welfare.
It is well known that a person who finds himself out
of work suffers a blow to bis self-esteem. This makes it
more difficult for him to think and act his way out of
his problem. A defeated, self-deprecating job applicant
conducts lackluster interviews that prolong his unem-
ployment, in turn lowering his self-esteem even more.
This may ultimately lead to welfare. If something could
intervene in this downward spiral and provide a real-
istic boost to self-esteem, the person would be in a
more powerful position to help himself.
This, roughly, was the reasoning of Larry Hildore,
director of the Ottawa County Department of Social
Service in Michigan. He had taken the course himself
and knew what the training could do. The only question
in his mind was whether the results could be measured
and what the measurements would look like.

To design the research project and do the testing, he and Dr. De Sau turned to Dr. James Motiff of the psychology department of Hope College in Holland,152  Michigan. For the test, they chose the widely used sixpage hundred-question Tennessee Self-Concept Test, which measures five aspects of a person's opinion of himself: physical self, moral/ethical self, personal self, family self, and social self. The test was given twice, once before the course and once after.

This alone might lead some to see the results as mere "Hawthorne Effect,'' In the mid-20's and early
'30's, Western Electric Company launched a far-reaching research project to study various changes in work-
ing conditions that might improve employee morale at their Hawthorne Plant in Chicago. No matter what the
company did, morale soared. They put something in; morale soared. They took it away; morale soared again.
The conclusion was that folks are simply glad to be noticed, and this shows up in improved morale.
To measure this possible "Hawthorne Effect," Dr. Motiff tested another group of welfare recipients, who
did not take the Mind Control course. 

They were tested twice, but unlike the Mind Control group, they experienced nothing special between the two tests. There
was no "Hawthorne Effect" 

Those who received Mind Control training wound up
with radically different views of themselves—changes
which in some cases exceeded chance by odds of millions to one. Changes were dramatic in all categories: The new graduates saw themselves as far better persons than they had earlier thought they were, and felt a new confidence in their ability to solve their own problems.

The degree of change led Dr. Motiff to exclaim that the data "are the most significant I have ever seen."

A report on the study said:
There had been some concern as to how receptive a . . . [welfare] mother in the depths of her misery would [be] to a sudden input of Mind

Control, with its optimistic "better and better" philosophy. That concern was quickly washed away . . . on the second weekend. One hundred percent of those originally enrolled returned to finish the course, and the original shy silence had been replaced by a buzz of animated conversation that threatened to turn the session into a full scale
revival meeting.

Almost everyone had something constructive to report . . . a new closeness to their children . . . a
chronic headache gone . . . decreased frustration . . . lost weight. One radiant young mother used the
Mirror of the Mind technique to find the answer to employment and saw only a hand writing a check.
The next day she got the job she'd always wanted. 

It is generally a state of mind, a damaged self-image, that puts a person in prison, and that coarsens and
brutalizes him while he is there; and it is a state of mind that often ensures his quick return once he is "free." The kind of freedom that Mind Control could be expected to give a prisoner is the kind it can give the rest of us: the smashing of mental confines that are manifested to many of us "on the outside" as headaches, ulcers, insomnia, and failure in life's work, and to the prisoner as walls and bars as well.

Mind Control's limited experience in prisons indicates that it results in an environment that is less brutal. Time spent there is no longer empty hours snatched by law from a person's life, but a rich part of life itself—hours of growing and self-discovery. 

Mind Control may not make prison a happy hermitage, but it can make it a more civilized place in which to grow.

Although statistical studies have not been made, the personal experiences of the prisoners and their instructors are far more eloquent. Lee Lozowick, when he was Mind Control's area coordinator in New Jersey (he resigned early in 1976 to establish Hohm, a spiritual community), taught the course seven times at Rah way State Prison—four times to a total of some sixty inmates, and three times to prison staff.

'There is no question," he said, "about the benefits the inmates and staff received from the course. 

You could see it in their faces." Officials were so impressed with Mind Control that prisoners who were studying for a college degree were given academic credit for the course.

Ronald Gorayeb, who succeeded to Mr. Lozowick's Mind Control post, offered the course to ten inmates at the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey. 

One man dropped the course when he was released from jail and wanted to return to complete it—prison officials had to say no. Another requested solitary confinement after the course to help him meditate—prison officials said yes. Still another, using the mental screen technique, programmed a job on the outside. He found one—all he needed for parole.
