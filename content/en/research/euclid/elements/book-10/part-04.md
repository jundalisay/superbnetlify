## Proposition 9

Squares on straight-lines (which are) commensurable in length have to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.

Squares having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number will also have sides (which are) commensurable in length. But squares on straight-lines (which are) incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. And squares not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number will not have sides (which are) commensurable in length either.

For let A and B be (straight-lines which are) commen- surable in length. I say that the square on A has to the square on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.

For since A is commensurable in length with B, A thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (that) which C (has) to D. Therefore, since as A is to B, so C (is) to D. But the (ratio) of the square on A to the square on B is the square of the ratio of A to B. For similar figures are in the squared ratio of (their) corresponding sides [Prop. 6.20 com.]. And the (ratio) of the square on C to the square on D is the square of the ratio of the [number] C to the [number] D. For there exits one number in mean proportion to two square numbers, and (one) square (number) has to the (other) square [num- ber] a squared ratio with respect to (that) the side (of the former has) to the side (of the latter) [Prop. 8.11]. And, thus, as the square on A is to the square on B, so the square [number] on the (number) C (is) to the square [number] on the [number] D.+
And so let the square on A be to the (square) on Bas the square (number) on C (is) to the [square] (number) on D. I say that A is commensurable in length with B.
For since as the square on A is to the [square] on B, so the square (number) on C (is) to the [square] (number) on D. But, the ratio of the square on A to the (square) on B is the square of the (ratio) of A to B [Prop. 6.20 corr.]. And the (ratio) of the square [number] on the [number] C to the square [number] on the [number] D is the square of the ratio of the [number] C to the [number] D [Prop. 8.11]. Thus, as A is to B, so the [number] C also (is) to the [number] D. A, thus, has to B the ratio which the number C has to the number D. Thus, A is commensurable in length with B [Prop. 10.6].
And so let A be incommensurable in length with B. I say that the square on A does not have to the [square] on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
For if the square on A has to the [square] on B the ra- tio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number then A will be commensurable (in length) with B. But it is not. Thus, the square on A does not have to the [square] on the B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number.
So, again, let the square on A not have to the [square] on B the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. I say that A is incommensurable in length with B.
For if A is commensurable (in length) with B then the (square) on A will have to the (square) on B the ra- tio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number. But it does not have (such a ratio). Thus, A is not commensurable in length with B.
Thus, (squares) on (straight-lines which are) commensurable in length, and so on....
Corollary
And it will be clear, from (what) has been demon- strated, that (straight-lines) commensurable in length (are) always also (commensurable) in square, but (straight- lines commensurable) in square (are) not always also (commensurable) in length.


##  Proposition 10

To find two straight-lines incommensurable with a given straight-line, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incommensurable) in square.
A+
E
D
B
C
Let A be the given straight-line. So it is required to find two straight-lines incommensurable with A, the one (incommensurable) in length only, the other also (incom- mensurable) in square.
For let two numbers, B and C, not having to one another the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number-that is to say, not (being) simi- lar plane (numbers)-have been taken. And let it be con- trived that as B (is) to C, so the square on A (is) to the square on D. For we leamed (how to do this) [Prop. 10.6 corr.]. Thus, the (square) on A (is) commensurable with the (square) on D [Prop. 10.6]. And since B does not have to the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number, the (square) on A thus does not have to the (square) on D the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square number either. Thus, A is incommensurable in length with D [Prop. 10.9]. Let the (straight-line) E (which is) in mean proportion to A and D have been taken [Prop. 6.13]. Thus, as A is to D, so the square on A (is) to the (square) on E [Def. 5.9]. And A is incommensurable in length with D. Thus, the square on A is also incommensurble with the square on E [Prop. 10.11]. Thus, A is incommensurable in square with E.


Thus, two straight-lines, D and E, (which are) in- commensurable with the given straight-line A, have been found, the one, D, (incommensurable) in length only, the other, E, (incommensurable) in square, and, clearly, also in length. [(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.]

## Proposition 11

If 4 magnitudes are proportional, and the first is commensurable with the second, then the third will also be commensurable with the fourth. And if the first is in- commensurable with the second, then the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth.

Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, (such that) as A (is) to B, so C (is) to D. And let A be commensurable with B. I say that C will also be com- mensurable with D.
For since A is commensurable with B, A thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. And as A is to B, so C (is) to D. Thus, C also has to D the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number. Thus, C is commensurable with D [Prop. 10.6].
And so let A be incommensurable with B. I say that C will also be incommensurable with D. For since A is incommensurable with B, A thus does not have to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.7]. And as A is to B, so C (is) to D. Thus, C does not have to D the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number either. Thus, C is incommensurable with D [Prop. 10.8).
Thus, if four magnitudes, and so on.


## Proposition 12

(Magnitudes) commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another.
For let A and B each be commensurable with C. I say that A is also commensurable with B.
For since A is commensurable with C, A thus has to C the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (the ratio) which D (has) to E. Again, since C is commensurable with B, C thus has to B the ratio which (some) number (has) to (some) number [Prop. 10.5]. Let it have (the ratio) which F (has) to G. And for any multitude whatsoever


of given ratios F to G-let the numbers H, K, L (which are) contin- uously (proportional) in the (se) given ratios have been taken [Prop. 8.4]. Hence, as D is to E, so H (is) to K, and as F (is) to G, so K (is) to L.
(namely,) those which D has to E, and
C
B
A
D
H
E
K
L
F
G
Therefore, since as A is to C, so D (is) to E, but as D (is) to E, so H (is) to K, thus also as A is to C, so H (is) to K [Prop. 5.11]. Again, since as C is to B, so F (is) to G, but as F (is) to G, [so] K (is) to L, thus also as C (is) to B, so K (is) to L [Prop. 5.11]. And also as A is to C, so H (is) to K. Thus, via equality, as A is to B, so H (is) to L [Prop. 5.22]. Thus, A has to B the ratio which the number H (has) to the number L. Thus, A is commensurable with B [Prop. 10.6].
Thus, (magnitudes) commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
