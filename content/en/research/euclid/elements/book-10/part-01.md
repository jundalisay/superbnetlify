## Definitions

1. "Commensurable" are magnitudes measured by the same measure.

"Incommensurable" are magnitudes which have no common measure.

2. Two straight-lines are commensurable when their bounding area are measured by the same area.
<!-- in square  squares on them -->

They are incommensurable when their area has no common measure.*

<!-- in square of the squares on them. -->

> *Superphysics note: This means that measurers have to be on 'the same page'


3. There is an infinite number of straight-lines which are either commensurable or incommensurable.

- Some are commensurable or incommensurable in length only.
- Others are commensurable or incommensurable in area also, with an assigned straight line. 

<!-- Therefore, let the assigned straight-line be called ratio- nal. And (let) the (straight-lines) commensurable with it, either in length and square, or in square only, (also be called) rational. But let the (straight-lines) incommensu- rable with it be called irrational.* -->

'Rational' lines are:
- the assigned straight line 
- those straight lines which are commensurable with the assigned straight line, whether in length and in square, or in square only

'Irrational' lines are those which are incommensurable with the assigned straight line.*

> *Superhysics note: Rational waves or ideas are those that have a single wave or idea as their reference. Irrational ones are those that are not bound by that single wave or idea. Irrationals are free and wild.   




4. The [binding] square on the assigned straight line is called 'rational'

Those areas which are commensurable with it are rational.

But those areas which are incommensurable with it are irrational
- The straight lines which produce those areas are irrational
<!--   - In case the areas are [binding] squares, then the bindings themselves are irrational
  - But in case the bindings are any other rectilineal shapes, irrational are the straight lines on which are described squares equal to them -->

<!-- sides -->
<!-- And let the square on the assigned straight-line be called rational. And (let areas) commensurable with it (also be called) rational. But (let areas) incommensu- rable with it (be called) irrational, and (let) their square- roots (also be called) irrational-the sides themselves, if the (areas) are squares, and the (straight-lines) describ- ing squares equal to them, if the (areas) are some other rectilinear (figure)." -->


## Proposition 1

Assume there are 2 unequal lines. 

- The longer line has more than half of it subtracted
- More than half of the reainder is subtracted

If this happens continually, then some magnitude will eventually be left. It will be less than the lesser laid out magnitude.

Let:
- `AB` and `C` are unequal magnitudes
- `AB` is the longer or greater

We subtract more than half from `AB`. From the remainder, we also subtract more than half. If this happens continually, there will be some magnitude left. But it will be less than the magnitude `C`.

If we keep on multiplying `C`, it will eventually be greater than `AB`.

Let it be multiplied, and let `DE` be a multiple of `C`, and greater than `AB`.

Divide `DE` into the parts `DF`, `FG`, `GE` equal to `C.


Subtract:
- from `AB`, `BH` greater than its half
- from `AH`, `HK` greater than its half

Repeat this process continually until the divisions in `AB` are equal in multitude with the divisions in `DE`.

Then, let `AK`, `KH`, `HB` be divisions which are equal in multitude with `DF`, `FG`, `GE`.



The remainder `GD` is greater than the remainder `HA` because:
- `DE` is greater than `AB`
- from `DE` there has been subtracted `EG` less than its half
- from `AB`, `BH` greater than its half 

`GD` is greater than `HA`

The following were subtracted:
-  from `GD`, the half `GF`
- from `HA`, `HK` greater than its half

This is why the remainder `DF` is greater than the remainder `AK`.

But `DF` is equal to `C`.
- Therefore `C` is also greater than `AK`.
- Therefore `AK` is less than `C`.

Therefore, there is left of the magnitude `AB` the magnitude `AK` which is less than the lesser magnitude set out, namely `C`.

The theorem can be similarly proved even if the parts subtracted be halves.


<!-- For C, when multiplied (by some number), will some- times be greater than AB [Def. 5.4]. Let it have been (so) multiplied. And let DE be (both) a multiple of C, and greater than AB. And let DE have been divided into the (divisions) DF, FG, GE, equal to C. And let BH, (which is) greater than half, have been subtracted from AB. And (let) HK, (which is) greater than half, (have been subtracted) from AH. And let this happen continu- ally, until the divisions in AB become equal in number to the divisions in DE.
Therefore, let the divisions (in AB) be AK, KH, HB, being equal in number to DF, FG, GE. And since DE is greater than AB, and EG, (which is) less than half, has been subtracted from DE, and BH, (which is) greater than half, from AB, the remainder GD is thus greater than the remainder HA. And since GD is greater than HA, and the half GF has been subtracted from GD, and HK, (which is) greater than half, from HA, the remain- der DF is thus greater than the remainder AK. And DF (is) equal to C. C is thus also greater than AK. Thus, AK (is) less than C.
Thus, the magnitude AK, which is less than the lesser laid out magnitude C, is left over from the magnitude AB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show. - (The theorem) can similarly be proved even if the (parts) subtracted are halves.
