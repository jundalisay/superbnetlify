Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s values. 
- If a man values productive work, then his happiness is in the service of his life.
<!-- the measure of his success in  -->
- But if a man values destruction, then his happiness is in the service of his own destruction.
 <!-- like a sadist—or self-torture, like a masochist—or life beyond the grave, like a mystic—or mindless “kicks,” like the driver of a hotrod car—his alleged happiness is -->

 <!-- then the measure of his success in the service of his own destruction.  -->

The emotional state of irrationalists cannot be properly designated as happiness or even as pleasure.
- It is merely a moment’s relief from their chronic state of terror.

Neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims. 

Man is free to attempt to survive by any random means, as:
- a parasite, or
- a moocher,
- a looter

But he is not free to succeed at it beyond the range of the moment.

Likewise, he is free to seek his happiness in any irrational fraud, whim, delusion, mindless escape from reality. 
- But he is not free to succeed at it beyond the range of the moment nor to escape the consequences.

I quote from Galt’s speech: 

{{< q a="John Galt" >}}
“Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy—a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of
your values and does not work for your own destruction. ... 

Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.”

The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not two separate issues. 



The following are two aspects of the same achievement:

1. To hold one’s own life as one’s ultimate value
2. To hold one’s own happiness as one’s highest purpose 

Existentially, the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of maintaining one’s life. Psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is an emotional state of happiness. 

It is by experiencing happiness that one lives one’s life, in any hour, year or the whole of it.

When one experiences the kind of pure happiness that is an end in itself—the kind that makes one think: “This is worth living for”—what one is greeting and affirming in emotional terms is the metaphysical fact that life is an end in itself.

But the relationship of cause to effect cannot be reversed. 

It is only by accepting “man’s life” as one’s primary and by pursuing the rational values it requires that one can achieve happiness—not by taking “happiness” as some undefined, irreducible primary and then attempting to live by its guidance. 

If you achieve that which is the good by a rational standard of value, it will necessarily make you happy; but that which makes you happy, by some
undefined emotional standard, is not necessarily the good. 

To take “whatever makes one happy” as a guide to action means: to be guided by nothing but one’s emotional whims. 

Emotions are not tools of cognition; to be guided by whims—by desires whose source, nature and meaning one does not know—is to turn oneself into a blind robot, operated by unknowable demons (by one’s stale evasions), a robot knocking its stagnant brains out against the walls of reality which it refuses to see.

This is the fallacy inherent in hedonism—in any variant of ethical hedonism, personal or social, individual or collective. “Happiness” can
properly be the purpose of ethics, but not the standard. 

The task of ethics is to define man’s proper code of values and thus to give him the means of achieving happiness. 

To declare, as the ethical hedonists do, that “the proper value is whatever gives you pleasure” is to declare that “the proper value is
whatever you happen to value”—which is an act of intellectual and philosophical abdication, an act which merely proclaims the futility of ethics
and invites all men to play it deuces wild.

The philosophers who attempted to devise an allegedly rational code of ethics gave mankind nothing but a choice of whims: the “selfish” pursuit of
one’s own whims (such as the ethics of Nietzsche)—or “selfless” service to the whims of others (such as the ethics of Bentham, Mill, Comte and of all
social hedonists, whether they allowed man to include his own whims among the millions of others or advised him to turn himself into a totally
selfless “shmoo” that seeks to be eaten by others).

When a “desire,” regardless of its nature or cause, is taken as an ethical primary, and the gratification of any and all desires is taken as an ethical
goal (such as “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”)—men have no choice but to hate, fear and fight one another, because their desires and their interests will necessarily clash. If “desire” is the ethical standard, then one man’s desire to produce and another man’s desire to rob him have equal ethical validity.

One man’s desire to be free and another man’s desire to enslave him have equal ethical validity; one man’s desire to be loved and admired for his virtues and another man’s desire for undeserved love and unearned admiration have equal ethical validity. 

If the frustration of any desire constitutes a sacrifice, then a man who owns an automobile and is robbed of it, is being sacrificed, but so is the man who wants or “aspires to” an automobile which the owner refuses to give him. 

These 2 “sacrifices” have equal ethical status. 

If so, then man’s only choice is to rob or be robbed, to destroy or be destroyed, to sacrifice others to any desire of his own or to sacrifice himself to any desire of others.

Then man’s only ethical alternative is to be a sadist or a masochist.

The moral cannibalism of all hedonist and altruist doctrines lies in the premise that the happiness of one man necessitates the injury of another.

Today, most people hold this premise as an absolute not to be questioned.

When one speaks of man’s right to exist for his own sake, for his own rational self-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his
right to sacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own belief that to injure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man’s self-interest—which he must selflessly renounce. 

The idea that man’s self-interest can be served only by a non-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred to those humanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to achieve the brotherhood of men.

It will not occur to them, or to anyone, so long as the concept “rational” is omitted from the context of “values,” “desires,” “self-interest” and ethics.


Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and upholds rational selfishness. 

Rational selfishness is made up of:
- the values required for man’s survival qua man.
- the values required for human survival

Irrational brutes:
- have never outgrown the primordial practice of human sacrifices
- have never discovered an industrial society
- have a concept of self-interest that manifests only as the grabbing the loot of the moment.

Rational selfishness is not made up of the values produced by the desires, emotions, aspirations, feelings, whims or the needs of irrational brutes.

Objectivist ethics holds that human good:
- does not require human sacrifices and
- cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone.

It holds that:
- the rational interests of men do not clash
- there is no conflict of interests among men who do not desire the unearned, who do not make sacrifices nor accept them, who deal with one another as traders, giving value for value.

The principle of trade is the only rational ethical principle for all human relationships whether they be:
- personal and social
- private and public
- spiritual and material.

It is the principle of justice.

A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. He does not treat men as masters or slaves, but as independent equals. 

He deals with men by means of a free, voluntary, unforced, uncoerced exchange—an exchange which benefits both parties by their own independent judgment. 

A trader does not expect to be paid for his defaults, only for his achievements. He does not switch to others the burden of his failures, and he does not mortgage his life into bondage to the failures of others.

"Spiritual" means that which pertains to man’s consciousness.

In spiritual issues, the currency or medium of exchange is different. But the principle is the same. 

Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of another man’s character.

Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciation of another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one’s own selfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether one deals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether one marries an ideal woman or a slut. 

In spiritual issues, a trader is a man who does not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or flaws, only for his virtues, and who does not grant his love to the weaknesses or the flaws of others, only to their virtues.

To love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self-esteem, is capable of love—because he is the only man capable of holding firm, consistent, uncompromising, unbetrayed values. 

The man who does not value himself, cannot value anything or anyone.

It is only on the basis of rational selfishness—on the basis of justice—that men can be fit to live together in a free, peaceful, prosperous, benevolent, rational society.

Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society?

Yes—if it is a human society. 

The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own life-span; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others. 

The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a man to devote his effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others who specialize in other fields. 

This form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it to achieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort than they could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desert island or on a self-sustaining farm.

But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can be of value to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, productive, independent men in a rational, productive, free society. 

Parasites, moochers, looters, brutes and thugs can be of no value to a human being—nor can he gain any benefit from living in a society geared to their needs, demands and protection, a society that treats him as a sacrificial animal and penalizes him for his virtues in order to reward them for their vices, which means: a society based on the ethics of altruism. 

No society can be of value to man’s life if the price is the surrender of his right to his life.

The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. No man—or group or society or government—has the right to assume the role of a criminal and initiate the use of physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. 

The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-defense. 

A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.
