The Lunarian is represented by the Mount of Luna or the Mount of the Moon. 

This mount is strengthened by the:
- star
- triangle
- circle
- single vertical line
- square, or 
- trident

Defects are shown by:
- grills
- crosses
- cross-bars
- islands
- dots, or
- badly formed stars either of health or character

<!-- Color, nails, and other matters detailed in the course of this chapter will determine which (119). The Mount of the Moon must be judged both by the strength of its curve outwardly on the percussion of the hand and by the size of the pad it forms on the inside of the palm.  -->

It is a well-developed Mount (120) if forms a bulge outwardly.
- If it is also exceedingly thick, forming a large pad on the inside of the hand, it is a very strong Mount (121).
- If the outward protuberance and the thick pad are both unusually large, you have an excessive Lunarian subject (122). 

In this type, vertical lines on the Mount add strength to it and cross lines show defects. 

If you see a strong vertical line extending the length or nearly so of the Mount, it will indicate an added strength, and a number of vertical lines if lying close together will also increase its power. 

These lines on a Mount developed at the side, but flat in the palm, will be nearly as powerful as if the Mount showed a medium development inside the palm. 

If the outward development and the large pad in the palm is seen, which has also a deep, well-cut vertical line or lines, it will show an excessively developed Lunarian reaching to the danger-point of the type. The Mount must be divided into three sections, the upper, the middle, and the lower, corresponding to the three worlds of the fingers in their qualities, each section enabling one also to locate health difficulties peculiar to the type. 

Grilles, cross-bars, or crosses on the Mount, badly formed stars, islands, dots, chained or wavy lines will locate health defects. When seen, the health indications of color, nails, I.ife line, and line of Mercury must be examined in connection with the Mount to aid in confirming the indications. 

The health defects of the Mount of the Moon are important, especially with women, as they bear directly on diseases peculiar to them, affecting life, temper, maternity, and future happiness. 

The upper, middle, and lower thirds of this Mount each show separate health difficulties. 

When defects are seen on any particular third, you are at once warned that the health troubles peculiar to that third of the Mount are present. In this manner you can not only tell that your subject has a health defect, but as well what this defect is.

Cross lines at the side of the hand have been erroneously called travel lines, and were supposed to show journeys. 

Older palmists interpret the following:
- vertical lines show voyages by water
- cross lines show journeys by land

These show that the Lunarian:
- has a penchant for water
- is naturally nervous, restless
- loves change or travelling

When strong lines are on this Mount, his restlessness has been accentuated, making him want to travel. 

Vertical lines, strengthening as they do his typical love of travel and also his typical love of water, make him the more likely to choose journeys by water rather than by land. This is the method of reasoning from which the use of vertical lines to indicate voyages arose. 

In our study of the Lunarian type, health defects must be constantly watched for. 

You might mistake cross lines or vertical lines as travel lines indicating journeys instead of as Lunarian health defects, especially among women. This will lead you to interpret the line as a journey, when it really indicates illness. 

The entire percussion of the hand is often found covered with cross lines. This shows that the subject is delicate in more ways than one, even if no sign of it has appeared to make him conscious of any health delicacy. 

They are always hyper-nervous, which precedes actual disease. 

These cross lines are also seen on the hands of old persons, often those who did not have them when young. 

They have appeared as age has weakened the constitution. 

The health defects of Upper Mars, which are throat and bronchial difficulty, intestinal inflammations, and blood disorders, are all shown by these cross lines on that Mount, which lies on the percussion. 

Those of the Mount of the Moon, which will be enumerated later, are also shown by cross lines on the Mount, and thus a crossing of the whole side, or percussion of the hand, would show delicacy of the entire structure from throat to kidneys and bladder. 

If any portion of the percussion is more thoroughly cross-lined than the others, or lines run across from it to the Life line, with health defects of nails, color, etc., shown, you can tell which one of the delicate parts will first give way, by the portion of the Mounts at the side of the hand on which these markings occur most strongly, or from which a line runs to a delicate Life line. 

This will be more fully treated in the study of the lines.

## Part 2 

The pure Lunarian is not often seen. Yet Luna qualities will be present in nearly everyone. 

His realm is the world of imagination.

He keeps humanity from becoming too material, and enables us to see with the " mind's eye." 

It is entirely because of the possession of imagination, a quality of mind which does not belong to the lower animals, and which gives to man the ability to form mental pictures, that certain words, sounds, or signs convey meanings - in short, that we have the power of speaking and communicating with each other. 

These methods of communication may be either by word of mouth in various languages; by telegraph, where each combination of dots on the sounder means a different letter, by combining which, words conveying ideas are produced; by writing, where each letter and every combination of them forms a word which conveys an idea to the mind; or by the sign language of the hand as employed by mutes, where each different manner of placing the fingers either means a letter, a word, or, with advanced users of this method, a whole statement. 

But none of these methods of communication would be possible if we lacked the imaginative power to link these lines, words, or gestures with the idea which they are intended to convey, and the understanding of these varied forms of communication would be impossible if we had not the ability to form a mental picture of the thing to which they refer. If I write the word house, it brings to mind a building and you mentally picture some sort of a structure. 

If I add, "A white frame house with low roof and red chimneys," you mentally see the house in your "mind's eye." This is the power of imagination, and if we did not have it we would be unable to communicate with each other, would have no ability to express ourselves. Thus the Lunarian was necessary, as he represents imagination, which makes possible communication, and he was made one of the seven types. Manifestly the more refined and greater the power of well-balanced imagination a subject possesses, the larger will be his vocabulary; the power of description will be greater and the ability to evolve new ideas increased. The more dense the subject, the more material are his imaginings, the more restricted his vocabulary, and, instead of catching an idea quickly, you have figuratively "to beat it into his head." 

This faculty of imagination and speech is what makes a high type of Lunarian brilliant; the lack of it makes the clodhopper, who can never say just what he wants to, who never mentally rises above the earth. Those subjects who can believe in nothing that they cannot touch, and who cannot carry in their minds mental pictures, lose much enjoyment and have little expansive ness of mind to help them through the world. When we find a subject with a well-developed Mount of the Moon, we have one who expresses himself well and can enjoy the pleasures of imagination; when we find it absent (123) we have one who can picture nothing to himself; when we find it excessive (see 122), we have a subject who easily becomes flighty, imaginative to a dangerous degree, and who even loses control of the mind entirely, becoming insane. 

Manifestly we care to find no excess nor deficiency with this Mount, but a good medium development, showing the presence of a healthy imagination, one that lifts the world above the plane of materialism into the realm of fancy. In the hands of the greatest linguists, musicians, composers, fiction or romance writers, we find this Mount strong.

They are able to see their characters in the "mind's eye," clothe them with proper attributes, and make them living realities in the minds of their readers. It is the power of imagining how scenes described look, and how characters portrayed appear, that makes it a delight to read. If the power of imagination were gone from us, we could conceive nothing but the bare things we see. 

Beautiful scenery, birds, flowers, color, or form would have little meaning to us, and pure, dull, monotonous reality would be all we had. If there were no imagination there would be no hope for the future. Many have no such hope; they can picture no future toward which to press. These subjects are deficient in Lunarian qualities, and spend their lives arguing that nothing is true, and that life is a vain struggle. 

Granting that imagination may sometimes lead to false conclusions, it is better to have some of them than to be unable to see beyond a limited horizon. 

<!-- DEFICIENT MOUNT OF MOON No. 123. DEFICIENT MOUNT OF MOON.  -->

The Lunarian is tall in stature, fleshy in build, with the lower limbs thick and the feet large. He is often quite stout, but his flesh is not firm and his muscles are not strong. 

He is soft and flabby and instead of muscular vitality, his flesh has a spongy feeling. His complexion is dead white, giving him a decided pallor and marking him as the victim of a weak heart's action, anaemia, kidney trouble, and often of dropsy. His head is round, thick through the temples, bulging over the eyes, and with a low forehead. 

The hair is not thick, but straggly and fine in quality, blond or chestnut in color, and quite straight. His eyebrows are scanty, uneven in contour, and often grow together over the nose. The eyes are round and starey in appearance, often bulging, and frequently watery. The color is gray or light blue, the whites are clear, and the pupil has a luminous appearance, seeming to refract light and showing a prismatic gleam. 

The lids are thick and flabby, giving them a swollen look. The nose is short and small, quite often turning up at the end, and sometimes showing the nostrils very plainly.

Frequently it is what we call a "pug" nose. The mouth is small and puckers, giving the appearance of being drawn together. The teeth are large and long, yellow in color, and irregularly placed in the gums, which are prominent and bloodless-looking. The teeth are soft and decay early. The chin is heavy, hanging in flabby folds and receding. 

The neck is fleshy, flabby, and wrinkled, connecting this peculiar-looking head with the fleshy-looking chest, which is again flabby and spongy in consistency. The voice is thin and pitched often in a high key. The ears are small and set close to his head. 

The abdomen is large and bulges forward, giving an awkward look, and the legs are not graceful, but thick and heavy, having a dropsical appearance. The feet are flat and large and the gait is a shuffle or is shambling, very much like the gait of a sailor when he walks on land.

The hand of a Lunarian is often found puffy in appearance, flabby in consistency, white in color, fingers short and smooth, with tips conic or pointed; the thumb small in size, with the first phalanx pointed or deficient in length. The Lunarian is controlled by imagination, consequently he is dreamy, fanciful, and idealistic. He is one who builds air castles, plans great enterprises, which are never put into operation because they generally have no practical value. The Mount Of The Moon.
