<!-- The Mount Of Venus. Part 6  -->

Bulbous nails shows throat, bronchial, or pulmonary trouble. 

Note this peculiar fact in these cases, that the consumptive Venusian has his sexual desires increased tremendously. This seems to be a symptom of this disease, especially in the middle stages. Hair on the hands, if black, will show the increased vitality peculiar to that color. 

If it be plentiful, it also shows increased muscular strength. Black color, showing plentiful supplies of iron, adds to the ardor of the type, and the subject is vigorous, energetic, and volatile. If the Mount be a strong one, black hair must be considered as an addition to its strength. Red hair adds its flashing excitability to the subject, making him preliable to quick temper and sudden changes of mood. In both these colors I suppose the hair to be fine in quality. 

If coarse, it will show all the indications of color, but in a coarse degree. This coarse black or red hair with a large Mount, grilled, will make the subject very susceptible to sexual attraction, where physical instead of mental charms are the moving power. Red or black hair, fine in quality, shows volatility in refined degrees. Gray or white hair is often seen on Venusians even when young. 

In these cases if the depleted vitality shown by this color comes from exhausted powers due to excess, the flabby much-grilled Mount will be seen. Blond color is normal, and gives its typical qualities. If straw color, it is not the Venusian blond, which must have a tinge of auburn or red to be normal. 

The more silver the blond color, the more it shows Teutonic phlegmatism, and the more it is tinged with the auburn shade, the more ardor is present. The hand as a whole will show the three worlds, and these must be more largely depended upon with this type than with any of the others except the Martian. With the fingers long, and especially the first phalanges of them, the mental world will govern the subject. The love will be ideal, the sympathy lofty, and the generosity intelligent. 

He will love music, poetry, romance, all of which will be viewed from a high plane and away from base thoughts and ideas. The middle portion of the hands and fingers strongly developed will add practical ideas, and make the subject less idealistic. The feeling of fellowship with all mankind will be very marked, and a full operation of generosity is expected, especially if the thumb be supple. This subject will love warmly, but will be sensible, not carried away by the idealism of the upper world nor the sensualism of the lower. 

These people are strong in the Venusian qualities, but regulate them. If the base of the palm be full and large, and stronger than the upper developments, the subject will be dominated by the low desires of the type. Fierce passion will inflame him, and he will regard all persons simply from the standpoint of ability to satisfy his desires. The pure, ideal side of love is unknown, and the bond of attraction to his fellows is physical desire. 

If this development of the base of the palm be very great, the third phalanges of the fingers thick, the first short, the Mount of Venus red and deeply grilled, and the thumb weak, the subject will murder if necessary to gratify his desires. These are the markings found on ravishers. The fingers and other Mounts must be examined to see what types are secondary, or which side of these types. If the Venusian has no Jupiterian ambition, Saturnian wisdom or soberness, or Mercurian shrewdness in his make-up, he will not achieve success in worldly or business affairs. 


While a lovable, attractive type, the Venusian needs some other types in combination to develop him. Whatever the secondary or tertiary types may be, they must be considered as back of the Venusian qualities as driving forces. The Apollonian is too closely akin to the Venusian to make a good combination; he has too many similar qualities. The Lunarian is not a good secondary combination, for imagination in too great degree will inflame the passions and make an already inert subject more lazy. 

It needs some side of the Jupiterian, Saturnian, Mercurian, or Martian type to perfect the Venusian. The finger-tips will tell their story. Marked ideality is present with pointed tips, in which case the dreamy qualities will render these subjects impractical, but lovable and fascinating. They are hot-house plants, "human china," fit to love and play with, but unequal to a struggle against the roughness of the world. 

Conic tips show artistic tastes and give conic qualities to the subject. Square tips make him practical, regular in habits, tidy in dress, and methodical in his ways. Delicately square tips are often seen, but not those which are broad, or pronouncedly square. Spat-ulate tips add energy, fire, and originality to the subject. He is ready, seldom taken off his guard, and in ideas or speech is always equal to the occasion.

The spatulate tip is a fine combination for the Venusian, for it makes him human in sympathy and love. These subjects are intensely fond of pets, - horses, dogs, or all animals; they are constant in their affections, original in ideas, active in games, skilful, graceful, and charming. 

They are passionately fond of children, and tender and gentle with everyone. Knotty fingers will greatly reduce the impulse of the subject. Though knots are unexpected still they are found, and must be considered. The first knot alone will make the subject intelligent, systematic in his mental operations, and less frivolous. 

The second knot will make him tidy, unusually careful of his appearance, and orderly in everyday life. Both knots will make him analytical, but, as the subject is dominated by enthusiasm and impulse, they are seldom seen well marked. Smooth fingers are expected. The artistic ideas, impulsive ways, and spontaneous methods in thought and action which are peculiar to the Venusian are all emphasized by smooth fingers; there may, however, be seen a slight development of the second knot, and still the fingers may be considered as smooth. These subjects love dress and good appearance, and are nearly always tidy. 

<!-- The Mount Of Venus. Part 7 -->

Long fingers are not expected, for the Venusian does not love detail. He loves pleasure, and to have someone else see that everything is planned and systematized. After all these details have been attended to, the Venusian likes to be called in to enjoy the things prepared. He will then be full of praise, and the long-fingered subject who has done all the work will say, "What an agreeable fellow he is, and how appreciative." Thus the Venusian by a few kind words often compensates for hours of labor, and his fellow-men will crowd each other in an effort to serve him. He lacks long-fingered detail, and also the suspicion and sensitiveness that belong to long fingers.

Long fingers add their propensities and are not normal to the type. 

Short fingers, with their quickness of thought and impulsiveness of action, are normal with the type.

Note carefully whether they are too short, for the impulsiveness of this type needs nothing to increase it. The natural distaste of the Venusian for detail emphasizes his short-fingered qualities, and increases the impulsive-ness and desire for quickness in thought and execution. Thus, when short fingers are seen, place short-fingered quickness and liability to carelessness back of the Venusian qualities and you will get the proper result. The thumb will be largely the key to your subject. 

If small or pointed, or both, you know the character is weak and vacillating. The desires will rule and be gratified, the subject will be easily led by others, and, with his natural pleasure-loving proclivities, will be led away by whoever obtains an influence over him. The natural laziness of the type will be increased, and determination lacking. You must compare the two phalanges to see if will or reason is greater. If will be stronger, determination will be exercised without good judgment, and this subject is determined by fits and starts. If the will phalanx be pointed, the impressionability is increased and the will weakened. 

If it be square, the will is stronger, common-sense, and practical. If it be spatulate, the will becomes very strong per se, but if unsupported by a good second phalanx and a good Head line will not be brought into operation. The clubbed formation is not often seen on this type, and is not normal. 

There is no fierceness nor bloodthirsty desire for murder in the good Venusian. When he kills, it is in a fit of jealousy or thwarted passion, and it is a low specimen of the type who does it. Refined, high-class Venusians never commit murder - there is too much kindness and sympathy in them. On low type Venusians you will always find a strong secondary type present, nearly as strong as the Venusian, and it is from this secondary type that they get the nerve and brutality to commit murder. 

The Venusian type supplies the passion and jealousy, the secondary type the instinct to kill. 

If the clubbed thumb be seen on a refined Venusian subject, you will find that the brutal tendencies are inherited, sometimes from generations back, and often never display themselves. The paddle-shaped will phalanx is an excellent one to find on this type, for the tendencies of the type are so strong that it needs all the restraints possible .to hold them in check, and strong, evenly balanced will power is one of the best possible restraining elements. 

The second phalanx must be long and well balanced to get the best results, for reason and good judgment are needed to keep the subject level. If this is deficient, he becomes a prey to his emotions, impulses, and desires, and lacks the good sense and judgment to restrain them, even if he has a will strong enough to do it. 

In this case, will is in operation, but is not backed by judgment. The best formation of the second phalanx is the waist-like, for tact is then indicated, and the subject does not offend by brusqueness. Thus, on a Venusian, the large thumb, giving good judgment and determination, will hold in check any amount of strong desires. 

In the chapter on the Thumb we said that this digit shows will, reason, and love, the three great moral forces of the universe. Thus the Venusian, in a perfect state, combines all these. 

The Head line must be clear, well cut, well colored, and unbroken, to give the best results, for the Venusian needs self-control and clear judgment to steer him from pitfalls. These elements he gets from such a Head line, which is a fine adjunct to a good thumb. Of the seven types the one which lightens the world with love, charms with beauty, attracts with health, sympathizes in sorrow, and relieves distress is the Venusian, and while we can by no means say that he is faultless, we must recognize that his good qualities are so predominant that his faults are forgotten.
