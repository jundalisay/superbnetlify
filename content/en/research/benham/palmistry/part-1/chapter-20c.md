<!-- Part 4  -->

Unless there are other things present which red qualities might influence, red is a good color. 

Blue will show liability to hemorrhoids and varicose veins, as well as heart disease. 
- A grille or blue cross-bars on the Mount of Saturn is a sign of piles, possibly of varicose veins. 

Look to the veins on the back of the hand for further confirmation. 

Nails are important to consider for both character and disease. 

The short, critical nail on a bad Saturnian will be a poor accompaniment. 

All the mean, critical qualities of this nail will be added to the disagreeable qualities of the type. Critical nails on even a good Saturnian are an unpleasant indication, and will make him cranky and pronounced in his views. 

The best nail is the broad healthy one, which will tend to give better health and consequently better temper. 

The narrow nail of delicate constitution does not help his condition, nor does it make him any more agreeable. Consumption and heart-disease nails will show these diseases present, though not being difficulties peculiar to the type, their presence would not be expected. If seen, use them as denoting their peculiar trouble. 

Fluted and brittle nails are expected, as nervousness and paralysis are health defects of the type. 

Judge the degree which the trouble has reached by the extent of change in the nail. Beginning at the white spots, through all the various stages to the brittle turned-back nail, you can tell how far the difficulty has progressed. In all nails first determine what the nail indicates, its degree of development, and then apply it to the Saturnian qualities which will give the correct reading. 

If it is a health indication, think whether the trouble is peculiar to the type. If it is, the danger is greater than if it is not.

Hair on the hands will tell by its presence and color how hardy the subject is. 

Black hair will add tricky tendencies to a Saturnian, blond color will make him more likely to be frank and trustworthy. 

Gauge the amount of hair found, its color and fineness. Use them to judge those of the type. 

Fingers being in excess of the palm will show that the mental world is in excess. 

This will make the subject a student and scholar, but he will not be much of a business person. 

He will write learned books, make a good teacher, but will not be a money-maker. 

If the middle portion of the hand is most pronounced the abstract world rules, and he will find success in business. 

If the lower third of the hand is developed grosser qualities will be added to the Saturnian and make him a very bad person. If one of the three worlds is absent and the other two developed, work out the combination. 

If it is mental and baser worlds with the middle absent, you know that a visionary Saturnian, who is ruled by bad, earthy qualities, is present, without the good influence of the middle world. Use this same reasoning with the other worlds which are present or absent. Note also the phalanges of the finger. If the first is longest the mental world is the strongest. 

The subject will be a student and a thinker inclined to superstition and fond of occult sciences. The second phalanx of the finger longest will show that farming, agriculture, scientific investigations, chemistry, physics, history, and mathematics are the things most to his taste. This is the medium world and the business side of the Saturnian is shown here. With this second phalanx longest he will be able to gain a livelihood from the pursuit of the vocations peculiar to the type, and should be advised to go into such occupations and pursue these studies. If the third phalanx is longest, the baser attributes will be in the ascendency. 

The Saturnian is not sensual. The baser quality which belongs to the type is money-worship.
 
A long third phalanx does not mean sensualism. 
- If the type is good and the third phalanx long you then he is only economical. 

If the type is coarse or bad and third phalanx long it means miserliness. 

If this third phalanx is thick it will make him less studious, if it is waist-like he will pursue with great eagerness the investigation of the studies for which he has peculiar aptitude. 

If the finger is bent it adds shrewdness to the Mount and the Saturnian qualities. If the finger is very short he is not a Saturnian, and entirely lacks seriousness and balance. 

Note whether the apex of the Mount leans toward Jupiter; if it does the wisdom of Saturn will be added to the Jupiterian ambitions, pride and love of command. If the apex lies toward Apollo it will lend soberness and wisdom to the Apollonian qualities. 

In either of these cases the severity of the morbidness of Saturn is diminished, for he gives himself over to the other Mounts. 

If the apex is in the centre of the Mount all his interest is centred in himself and is uninfluenced by the qualities of the other Mounts. If the finger leans toward Jupiter it will give off some of the strength of Saturn to Jupiter. 

Thus Jupiter will become wise and cautious as a leader. If the finger leans toward Apollo some of the Saturnian soberness will be drawn toward Apollo and he will become more quiet and careful. You must note the finger tips. If all the tips are of one shape and Saturn's tip is different, it means that Saturn will have the qualities of his tip, the other fingers those of the tips they have. 

This is very useful if the fingers be conic, for a conic tip to Saturn alone with all other tips square or spatulate, would make the balance wheel weaker than the rest of the fingers. If the other fingers are conic and Saturn conic also, it does not throw him out of balance. 

The more pointed the tip of Saturn, the more idealism enters into the subject. Superstition is rampant, and he is ruled by dreams, signs, and omens. This is especially true if the first phalanx be long as well as pointed. The character is more erratic, and the balance wheel not so powerful. 

If the tip be square you find practical common-sense, and the subject becomes quiet, less superstitious, and inclines to soberness and even melancholy if very square. Note which phalanx is the longest. A conic tip and long second phalanx will give idealism to the attributes of the second phalanx and affect their operation. In like manner it will affect both the first and third phalanges if they are longest. The Mount Of Saturn. 

## Part 5 

Square tips will make the farming, chemistry, medicine, physics, or mathematics of the second phalanx very practical, useful, and likely to be pro ductive of money results. 

It will add greatly to the economy or miserliness of the third phalanx, and take away from the superstition of the first. 

Spatulate tips will add activity and originality to the Saturnian wisdom and soberness, will impel the subject to mingle with his fellows, be more active, and will make him a great worker, if he is a farmer. 

If a chemist, it will lead him to seek new compounds, if a doctor, new treatments, if a mathematician, new systems for figuring, and it will give great activity in all these operations. 

The individual phalanges must be judged, and spatulate qualities added to them as found developed. The spatulate tip is the broadest of all; it will thus give the greatest seriousness to the finger. The spatulate balance wheel will be the strongest balance of alt. 

If the Saturnian type be very pronounced with this spatulate tip (100), the subject will be gloomy, morose, sullen, and hard to get along with, for he will push his disagreeable qualities with spatulate activity and originality. If the finger be very deficient with a conic tip, the subject will be led by everyone and will have no stamina whatever (101 two illustrations). The balance wheel is entirely lacking, and even a good thumb will not help this subject, for he is flighty and entirely untrustworthy.

If the fingers are knotty, the qualities of analysis and reasoning will be present. They will make Saturnian qualities more pronounced and add to the seriousness of the subject. Always a careful type, knotty fingers will make them more careful and slow and with knots, there will be no such thing as impulse or sentiment. 

A natural doubter, the Saturnian with knotty fingers will be an absolute skeptic. 

he will be analytical in his agricultural and scientific pursuits, and a methodical person. The knotty-fingered Saturnian makes a good judge, for he is wise, not governed by sentiment, and analytical. Conic tips lessen the intensity of knotty fingers. Square tips make them practical, spatulate tips, active and original. All these combinations of tips will be seen on knotty-fingered Saturnians, and life to this subject is serious and real. Smooth fingers make a Saturnian impulsive, a lover of the beautiful, and his musical nature becomes prominent.

If the tips be conic this is most pronounced, if the tips be square the artistic side becomes practical, and with spatulate tips spatulate qualities are present. 

The smooth-fingered Saturnian is a decidedly happier type, and not so liable to despondency. He tends strongly toward superstition and becomes proficient in occult sciences. Long fingers give him detail and minutiae. If the first phalanx be long, he goes into the depths of mysticism and superstition. With the second phalanx long, he will not omit a detail in the scientific studies or the agricultural pursuits which he follows. 

Short fingers will give the quick thought and action peculiar to them. The Saturnian qualities will be present but will be operated with short-fingered quickness. If the tips be conic, the short-fingered impulse will be very great, if square it will decrease in degree, and spatulate tips will add the fiery impetuosity belonging to these tips. 

Short fingers will make the Saturnian less careful in dress but also less repellent and more approachable. Long fingers make him tidier, but the suspicion of long fingers leads him to distrust and dislike mankind, and he is hard to get acquainted with. The thumb tells what support will and reason are to give to the subject. A short thumb will show a weak character and will make the Saturnian racillating. 

A large thumb will add to the gravity and ceterciizatxoci of the type 

With the thumb thoroughly understood, it will not be hard to apply whatever thumb is fosced to the Saturian qualities of the subject.

The excentt of oceernsirmtion. gange by Length of the will phalanx, what kind. by the shape of the phalanx. for was reason is present, by the Length of the second phalanx, and that kind by the shape of this phalanx. Whether will or reason are balanced, is determined by the comparative lengths of the phalanges. 

These will all tell the amount and kind of force pushing the Saturnian qualities forward. Pointed thumbs take away from the strength of the type, square or spatnlate add greatly to it. Note carefully which Mount type is secondary and which world guides it from the phalanges of its finger. In this way having found in which world the Saturnian subject is most prominent, you will be able to judge what side of the secondary Mount will operate to aid him. The Saturnian is predisposed to suicide as an end to his woes. 

Always more or less gloomy by nature, ill-success, sickness, or slighting treatment often casts him into depths of despair from which he sees no relief but death. 

If he be a high type he may, by mental force, hold himself level. If he be ill or weak in character, a dose of poison will relieve him from suffering. 

See hands of the Chittenden Hotel suicide. 

<!-- In considering the matter of criminology in connection with the types, we find more  -->

Real criminals come more from the Saturnians and Mercurians than from any of the others. 

There is in these two types an instinct of dislike toward mankind, even if the subjects have only a slightly excessive development. 

This leads the bad specimens to constantly invade the rights of others. The prisons are occupied by a majority of Saturnians and Mercurians. In examining the crimes for which law-breakers are incarcerated, it becomes apparent that the other types have fallen, often from bad environments or from sudden temptations to do wrong, which have overcome the subject before he has had time to think it over. 

In these cases, the subjects are heartily sorry they transgressed the law, and very infrequently become chronic law-breakers.

They are the so-called criminals who can be reclaimed. The fact is, they were never real criminals. 

The professional crooks who commit crime at every opportunity, and serve 2-3 sentences, becoming under the law "habitual criminals," are almost all Saturnians or Mercurians. 

They are real criminals at heart - mean to do wrong. Their hands are against every man. They live and die planning how to best their fellows. 

These subjects do not reform in reality - all pretences in this direction are merely to deceive and gain an advantage over the unsuspecting. 

An interesting fact to note in this matter of criminality is that the two types from which criminals come are the two bilious ones, the Saturnian and Mercurian. 

Bile seems capable of perverting everything and making it evil. Certainly, its 2 types are those from which the most desperate criminals spring. Keep this well in mind in estimating the Saturnian. 

Not all Saturnians are bad. 

Some of the grandest of men, noble, high-minded, and successful, belong to this type. 

Abraham Lincoln was one. Do Saturnians justice. They might be Lincolns. But at the same time, do not forget the many "Burglar Jims" who are also Saturnians.
