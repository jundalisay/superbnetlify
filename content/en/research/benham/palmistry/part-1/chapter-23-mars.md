THE fifth Mount type is the Martian. He is identified by:
- the 2 Mounts of Mars
- the Upper Mount on the percussion and above the Line of Head
- the Lower Mount under the Line of Life and above the Mount of Venus

The Plain of Mars is located in the centre of the palm, which bears some relation to the Martian type.

In the map, the lower boundary of Lower Mars is the word "aggression," and all under that word belongs to the Mount of Venus.
As single signs or in combination the star, triangle, circle, single vertical line, trident and square, strengthen the Upper Mount of Mars.

The cross-bar, cross, island, dot or grille, show defects of the Mount, either of health or character. Nails, color, etc. will determine which.

All cross lines, stars, crosses or grilles in the Plain of Mars, increase the inflammability and temper of the subject.

Signs on the Lower Mount of Mars must be read on the Influence lines inside of the Life line (113). In the earlier history of Palmistry the Plain of Mars was considered to be the principal part of the Martian development. The Upper Mount was afterwards located and found to be a strong factor, and in later years the Mount of Venus was subdivided so as to give the upper portion to what is now called the Lower Mount of Mars because it is below the Line of Life. 

Any attempt to use only one of these Martian developments to the exclusion of the other, will lead to error, and it is only by the combined use of the two Mounts and the Plain of Mars that you will be able properly to estimate the Martian, a type constantly encountered in very pure development, and which you will find in combination with most of the other types. 

In gaining the material for this chapter I have taken the most pronounced Martians, and alongside of them, subjects who have been entirely deficient in Martian development, and from these pronounced cases, several thousand in number, I have tabulated what I believe to be an accurate and trustworthy system of handling the type. 


This type embodies the elements of aggression and resistance. This makes the Martian a fighter.

It does not mean that:
- the Martian always fights physically. 
  - He really more often fights in the mental or business world. 
- all Martians will be soldiers 
  - Though all true Martians would quickly enlist to fight for a beloved country

Instead, they will:
- always push with vigor anything with which they may be connected
- more stoutly resist the efforts of those who seek to force them, than will the other types. 

Thus, the Martian is aggressive.

In almost all hands we find some Martian development. If we fail to find it, the subject is easily discouraged and overcome in the struggle for existence. 

The Martian qualities of aggression or resistance are necessary to the completion of any character, for without them the subject will be run over and trampled under foot, and no matter how brilliant or talented he may be, without the Martian fighting qualities, his brilliancy will never be brought before the eyes of the world. There are two kinds of fighters=  those who are the aggressors and force the issue, and those who act in self-defense or resist the pressure brought to bear upon them. This separation of Martian qualities is shown in the Upper Mount of Mars, which indicates resistance (114), and the Lower Mount of Mars, which shows aggressive spirit (115). 

Often you find one of these Mounts largely developed and the other small, in which case the subject will have either great aggression, or great resistance, according as it is the Lower or the Upper Mount which is the larger. Often you find both Mounts very largely developed. In this case you have a large supply of both aggression and resistance, and the subject will push himself forward with great persistence, and will also resist vigorously the attempt of anyone to impose upon him. These subjects with both Mounts large, simply shove themselves over every obstacle and stubbornly resist any attempt to force them clown. They never know when they are beaten, and permit no one to think that defeat is a possibility with them. 

The strong double Mount is a most advanced Martian development, and when seen, the subject must be classed as a Martian at once. This type is unmistakable. The Plain of Mars, if largely developed, or if much crossed by fine or red lines, will show sudden temper to be present. This development with the other two Mounts large will make a dangerous combination, for it will add inflaminability to the already great aggression and resistance. 

To the Plain of Mars used to be attributed the aggressive qualities which we now ascribe to the I.ower Mount of Mars, for it was observed by the old palmists that sudden tempers which were present with a strong Plain of Mars made the subject flare up and become very aggressive. But this temper soon died, and it has been observed that there is a vast difference between one who steadily and coolly pushes his way over all opposition, and one who simply gets mad and for the time being makes "Rome howl." The ancients fully appreciated the value in human success of this aggressive quality which would force men to overcome opposition at any cost, and when they put forth the rule that "A hollow palm indicates misery, loss of money, and failure in all enterprises," it was because they thought that the hollow palm showed lack of aggression and that its absence would produce these results. 

The Mount Of Mars. Part 2 In this case the hollow palm did not locate the seat of aggression, and its absence only allowed a lack of temper, which had been confused with real aggression; so the hollow palm is now shorn of its terrors, and is to be found in the hands of very successful people. The absence of the Lower Mount of Mars (116) is much more likely to produce the resulting failure attributed by older palmists to a hollow palm, for without the Lower Mount developed, a subject will allow someone much inferior in attainments to push past him by the sheer force of aggression. 

The three subdivisions of the Martian are resistance (Upper Mars), aggression (Lower Mars), and temper (Plain of Mars). The Martian according to this division becomes a three-sided fellow and you will have no trouble in estimating him properly if you carefully note which formation he has, and in what degree of development. When the Upper Mount of Mars is developed so as to make a curve outwardly at the percussion of the hand (see 114), it is a strong Mount; when, in addition, it is so full that it forms a perceptible pad on the inside of the palm, it is unusually strong. 

When the side of the hand at the percussion is straight, or with a depression where the Mount ought to be, the qualities of the Mount are absent (117). This absence of Martian development is to be noted carefully, for dire results often follow such a deficiency. The Upper Mount of Mars gives to a subject the power of resistance, that is, under all circumstances he is cool, collected, calm, does not lose his head, is equal to emergencies, and does not get discouraged if things go against him. He does not give up fighting even when the chances seem slim, and when knocked down he rises again seemingly unaware of the possibility of defeat. This power of resistance, this faculty of never giving up, often makes the Martian successful over all obstacles. 

When, on the contrary, this Upper Mount is absent, and the side of the hand fiat or hollow, you know that the subject is easily discouraged, gives up quickly when hard pressed, and lacks resistance. In moments of danger he becomes excited, and when knocked down he does not rise, for he thinks that it is no use to try any more. Thus you can see what a wonderful power this Upper Mount gives through this faculty of resisting, and what a loss the lack of it is. 

In the reading of every hand it must be thoroughly taken into account, for even dull or ordinary persons will push themselves through the world if they do not get discouraged. This deficient Mount is found on the hands of almost all suicides. The subject with only the Upper Mount developed will not force the fighting, will not hunt strife, but will be content to resist opposition, and to overcome oppression when it appears. 

The Lower Mount of Mars (see 115) will show the subject who pushes his plans to the fullest extent, does not stop to consider other people, but with "hammer and tongs," if necessary, forces himself over and through all opposition. He seeks strife, loves it, and is always the pusher who is full of aggression. Note this point carefully, if you find a hand with the Lower Mount strong and the Upper one lacking, the subject will be a great bluffer, but not having resistance will back down easily if pressed. Having fixed the distinction between aggression, resistance, and temper, we will consider the typical Martian, and judge him as being the aggressor, the resister, or a combination of both, according as the respective Mounts are developed.

The Martian is of medium height, very strongly built, muscular looking, carries himself erect, shoulders back, and has the appearance of one ever ready to defend himself. His head is small, bullet shaped, with an unusually large development at the base of the brain. The back of the neck is broad and, in a pronounced specimen, developed much above the average. The face is round, the skin thick and strong, red in color, and often presenting a mottled appearance. The hair is short, stiff, sometimes curly and of an auburn or red color. 

The beard is short and harsh. The eyes are large and bold looking, with a bright expression, dark in color, and with the whites often bloodshot, showing the great strength of his blood supply. The mouth is large and firm, the lips thin with the under one slightly the thicker. The teeth are small, regular, strong, and yellowish in color. The brows grow thick, straight, and low over the eyes, giving often the appearance of a scowl. The nose is long, straight, or of the Roman type, the chin firm and strong, often turning up slightly at the end. 

The ears are small and set close to the head, the red color of skin being quite prominent around them, this red often turning to a purple, congested appearance with strongly marked subjects. The neck is short and thick, connecting the head with a finely developed pair of shoulders, broad and muscular, with large muscles running down the back and a big expansive chest. 

In this chest is a pair of large, strong lungs which send forth a big commanding voice full of resonance and power. The legs are short but stout and muscular, the bones of the body are big and strong, the feet are broad and the instep inclined to be flat, making the subject walk in a proud, determined manner. Altogether he shows himself one well able to force his way through the world, mentally if he can, physically if he must. 

The Martian by his very appearance shows his true character, full of fight, either aggressively or in self-defence, mentally or physically, a strong, robust constitution, and one ardent in all things. The Martian is first of all brave, to him the conflict brings no thought of danger. Consequently the Martian makes an excellent soldier. If an army could be marshalled which should be composed of typical Martians, there would be no such thing as defeat possible to them, it would be victory or death. (Leonidas at the pass of Thermopylae undoubtedly had such a band and their work was tinged with the true Martian spirit.) 

The Martian has also robust health, consequently is naturally energetic, and with good health is not so likely to have his vital forces sapped by inertia. The Mount Of Mars. Part 3 This gives him an added power, which pushes forward his aggressive side and makes him able more readily to resist discouragements. As a soldier it also makes him able to endure the fatigue of any campaign, and to push forward by rapid marches to seek and smite his opponent.

His vigorous constitution fills him with the desire to accomplish whatever he sets out to do, and his energy makes him put forward the utmost effort to gain success. He is exceedingly generous in the use of his money, caring for wealth only for what it will buy for him. He is one who loves to have friends and admirers, and generally succeeds in gaining them. He is exceedingly devoted to these friends and will fight for them, as well as spend his money freely with them and in their behalf. He is not always refined and delicate in his ways, but is often brusque and lacking in tact. He is well-meaning, however, and while he sometimes accomplishes his purposes in a vigorous manner, his typical characteristics must be taken into account and you must not expect him to be always a Chesterfield. He is determined, and the stronger the type the more this is accentuated.

Do not think you can oppose a Martian with impunity, and be sure that if you do oppose him there will be a fight on your hands. 

The Martian can be reasoned with and coaxed, but never driven. He is exceedingly amorous. His strong blood current and big muscular development speak of an exuberance of health, and fill him with the fire of passion, and the opposite sex becomes very attractive. 

When he falls in love it is with all the intensity of his strong nature. He simply proceeds to storm the heart of bis charmer, as he does the works of an enemy. 

This Martian fire and dash so astound the object of his love that she is apt to surrender to the assault. No sickly sentimentality takes part in his wooing, it is audacity and vigor from start to finish. The Martian is domineering, especially if the Lower Mount is developed. 

Remember opposition rouses all of his fighting qualities, and this is his strong side; so all other types do well to mollify him, leading him by tact and diplomacy, rather than trying to force him. The Martian is a heavy eater. 

It takes plenty of fuel to feed the fires of his strong body, so it takes a great deal of food and the heartiest kind at that. 

He wants plenty of rare beef, potatoes, eggs, cabbage, turnips, and all of the more solid kinds of food. Salads and dainties that attract the epicurean taste do not suffice for him. He is very fond of games that require physical strength and power. 

Wrestling, boxing, football, baseball, and all kindred sports strongly appeal to him. The rougher the sport and the greater the strife, the better he likes it, and the better he succeeds. His is a big nature, he is not narrow in his views, and in all games or sports he wants absolute fairness to rule and the best man to win. He is primarily an active type, so those things which are accomplished by daring and energy seem to him the real things. The student and the philosopher appear to him small and insignificant. 

The achievements accomplished before the eyes of the world are what appeal to him. The Martian is found in every walk in life. His strong characteristics are daily felt in the mental world, the business community, the army, the church, the state - everywhere. He must be put into occupations and surroundings where he can work off his surplus energy either in pushing his affairs or fighting in the field. 

To put a Martian where he must be under restraint would be like stopping the safety-valve on a boiler and crowding on steam. Outdoor active occupations best suit him, and one confined to office routine should have a gymnasium near at hand. Wherever he may be, in whatever walk in life, he is always the same ardent, strong fellow, proud to a degree, fond of show, an imposing figure and the hero of the masses who bow down to his superior strength and daring. As a painter the Martian will choose battle scenes, hunting scenes, or games of sport. 

As a reader he chooses tales of war or strife, and never tires of the heroes who have come down through the traditions of the ages. As a musician he loves music full of fire and pronounced rhythm, and not the plaintive love song. A brass band most strongly appeals to him. As a speaker he deals in strong sentences, and loves to tell of battles and physical prowess. In everything he is the same, and his Martian ideas tinge his horizon with their ardent strength.
