The Apollonian is identified by the Mount and finger of Apollo.
- This is a good type. 

The Apollonian sometimes becomes mercenary and shoddy. 
- But he does not often become bad or criminal.
- Saturn and Mercury, the bilious types, become bad and vicious. 

Apollonians do not often descend to criminality. 
- When they do, it is the result of sudden emotions or circumstances, and not as a result of inherent badness. 

The following strenthen the Mount of Apollo as single signs, or in combination:
- star
- triangle
- circle
- single vertical line
- square
- trident

The cross-bar, grille, cross, island, or dot, show defects of the Mount, either of health or character. Nails, color, etc., will determine which (102). 

The normal Apollonian is healthy and vigorous. Consequently, he is happy, genial, and attractive. 

He is a spontaneous type, and versatility, brilliancy, love of the beautiful and artistic in everything, are his attributes. Standing alongside the Saturnian, he is the direct opposite of that gloomy fellow. 

The dark side of life is in the background with him and, as the Saturnian was needed as a check to over-enthusiasm, so the Apollonian is needed in order that darkness and gloom may not dominate. 

Play and diversion must follow work if we are to keep ourselves healthy and vigorous, and someone must provide these recreative things, these rests from seriousness. We must have comedians, for laughter is atonic to the tired brain. The Jupiterian is engrossed in his schemes for aggrandizement; 

The Saturnian is absorbed in wisdom, sobriety, or gloom; who then shall provide the bright things which shall make life worth living? That task is the Apollonian's. This type has been completely misunderstood. It has always stood for art and brilliancy. and the temptation has been to ascribe to every hand which has a good Mount of Apollo great artistic talent, frequently far in excess of that really possessed by the subject. 

All Apollonians are not artists or actors, and never can be. 

All Apollonians love beauty in dress, home, business surroundings. <!-- , and every walk in life in which they are found. --> 

They enjoy life by the force of their spontaneous natures, and cause those around them to enjoy it. 

All things beautiful and artistic appeal to them. 

They might be producers or creators of art, but they always love it. 

There is a wide difference between a creative person and a mere lover of the beautiful. 

Do not ascribe great artistic talent to one who is merely fond of beauty in dress and surroundings. 

The creative Apollonian has:
- a finely developed Mount
- apex in the centre
- finger long
- first phalanx long
- a fine, deep-cut Line of Apollo (103), often with stars in it


<!-- With the above strong markings, he will have creative power and will not be merely a lover of the beautiful (104).  -->

The Apollonian <!-- has another side. He --> is also highly successful in business. He carries his love of beauty here as everywhere else. 

He is richly endowed with graces which draw people to him, and with his natural brilliancy and versatility he adapts himself to the conditions of the times, the demands of the public, chooses his goods with a tasteful eye, and makes money thereby. 

The business Apollonian has:
- a strongly marked high Mount
- apex in the centre, but not necessarily cut with deep lines. 
  - if there are any, you will find several vertical ones on the Mount, showing diversity of talent, but not the creative power of the artist.

Generally you find a secondary, Mercurian development to accentuate the business shrewdness. With the Apollonian it is necessary, above all, to distinguish these two classes, - those capable of creative power in art, and those who are mere lovers of the beautiful and tasteful things of life.

The Apollonian is a handsome and a manly type. 

He is of medium height, between the Jupiterian and Saturnian, is not fleshy like the Jupiterian nor lean and lanky like the Saturnian, but is shapely, muscular, and athletic. The lines of the body run in graceful curves, and he is light and supple. His complexion is clear, his skin white, fine and firm in texture, and cheeks rosy. This pinkness of color gives the clue to a healthy condition and consequent attractiveness. 

The hair is thick, wavy, and black or auburn in color, fine and silky in quality, and when he has a beard it partakes of the same fineness and abundance, growing over the chin, lip, and high on the cheeks. His forehead is broad and full, but not high, the eyes are large, almond-shaped, brown or blue in color, with long lashes curling up at the ends. 

The eyes have a frank, honest expression, which changes to sweetness and sympathy when the emotions are in play, and they sparkle with the brilliancy and life of the brain behind them. 

His cheeks are firm and rounded, showing no hollows. The nose is straight and finely shaped, the nostrils beautifully proportioned, and dilating sensitively under the play of emotions; as is the case with all highly strung organizations. 

The mouth is graceful in outline, the lips curved and set evenly, neither thin nor large and thick. The teeth are finely shaped, strong, even, and white, firmly set in healthy red gums. The chin is shapely and rounded, neither retreating nor protruding, showing evenly balanced firmness. The ears are of medium size, well formed, and pink, setting close to the head. The neck is long, muscular, and well shaped, but showing neither cord-like muscles, nor a prominent "Adam's apple." 

This shapely neck connects the well-shaped head with strong shoulders, which are muscular and graceful. The chest is full and capacious, expands well under the inspiration, which fact undoubtedly contributes much to purifying the blood, pink color with healthy conditions following. The voice is musical, but not full or resonant. The lower limbs are graceful, muscular, finely proportioned, and are never fat. 

The feet are of medium size, the insteps arching and high, which gives spring and elasticity to the walk. 

This is a particularly distinguishing feature of the Apollonian. In this type is a picture of healthy conditions, beautiful proportions, grace and symmetry of body, and to these must be linked a mind full of similar charms and attributes. 


## Part 2 

From every point of view the Apollonian is brilliant, full of the love of beauty, art, color, and form. 

The Mount, from its brilliancy, has also been called the Mount of the Sun, and the Line of Apollo, when strongly marked in the hand, has been called the Line of the Sun, or of Brilliancy, and to it has been ascribed a fortunate career, with wealth and fame as the reward. As this line shows the strength of development of the Apollonian qualities in a subject, making the Mount stronger, thus the type also, it is not unreasonable that wealth and fame should be secured by so brilliant a subject as is the Apollonian.

The Apollonian is highly intuitive. He sees through things more quickly than other people and especially is this perceptive faculty strong in art and literature. He does not labor to learn, as does his companion, the Saturnian, neither is he as profound and deep. But the Apollonian, no matter how little he may really know, will make a brilliant show of it, and in any company, from the seeming depth of his knowledge and research, is a surprise. This arises from the wonderful versatility of his nature, and the quick way he has of grasping a small idea and making a great deal out of it. He is inventive as well as an imitator, and can put old things in new ways. 

 Thus he often gets credit for knowing a great deal more than he really does. He is always the centre of attraction in whatever company he may be found, and will adapt himself to circumstances and people. He can be thrown with scientists and will cope with them in whatever field of research they are working. 

 He will, with equal facility and without thought or preparation, join a body of socialists, artists, anarchists, doctors, lawyers, or any profession or class, and will astonish those present with his seeming mastery of the particular subject. His adaptability and versatility are astonishing, and "brilliant" is the only word that fitly describes him. He fairly sparkles with intuition, and seems to learn without study.

 This makes him sought by all classes of people. He is the life of the drawing-room, the hero of the athletic field, the daring and successful plunger either in the stock market or at the gaming table. In any and all walks of life he is found, full of dash, brilliancy, versatility. For him the beautiful in nature, women, home decorations, and dress, have always a fascination. Anything that lacks beauty is repulsive.

 With this strong passion in him he is the artist always and in everything. He may not be the great painter, but if he have short nails, surely he is the critic. He adores art in every form, and owing to his versatility, he is always a dabbler in it. He loves fine clothes, luxurious home surroundings, and jewels. 

 If he is the refined type with first phalanx the longest, he will have excellent taste in all these. If he belongs to the class who have the world of the third phalanx longest, he will be loud and shoddy in displaying his love of such matters. He is a good fellow. Health is good with him, so he feels kindly toward mankind, especially as he manages to cope with them so easily. He is a warm friend, but being somewhat changeable is not always constant. 

 Being brilliant, he makes enemies among those less so than himself, and these enemies often become bitter and envious rivals. His brain is clear, and in all matters of business, religion, art, or literature he sees things from a logical point of view. He has a great facility of expression, and while not always deep is easy to understand. 

 To him success is natural, it comes by the very force of circumstance. Friends and the world like him and gladly do much to forward his interests, and he is thus pushed by his admirers into many advantageous enterprises. He attains high positions and is a great money-maker. He is never economical and does not rely on putting away a part of his earnings, but by brilliant and successful spurts forges ahead. 

 His tastes are luxurious and his expenditures follow them, but he makes so much that the expenses seem little. He is always figuring in the thousands, and looks down upon the single dollars. The Apollonian is never afraid to air his views, or to speak his mind freely, and he loves to hear himself talk. He is religious in his instincts, and seemingly understands religion as he does every other subject and problem of the universe. He is not a fanatic, nor superstitious, nor is he a doubter; but he embraces religious faith with the eagerness characteristic of him. Among his other accomplishments, he is proficient in occult sciences, and does some wonderful things. He cannot explain how, but knows it is not from deep study. It is in reality his highly intuitive faculties that make him proficient here. 

 He is cheerful, happy, and bright, and though he is subject to bursts of quick temper which are fierce while they last, it is only a momentary flash, and he holds no resentment. He does not harbor grudges and has the ability to win over his worst enemy to at least a seeming friendship. He does not make lasting friends, but by his brilliancy temporarily attracts and enslaves. He himself is not a lasting friend, consequently he does not inspire true friendship in others. As much as he loves pleasure and gayety he is neither amorous nor sensual, - that is, in the high type. He loves a banquet as much for the after-dinner wit, the music, the decorations, the beauty of dress, as for the viands which grace the table. 

 He loves women who are beautiful, finely or tastefully dressed, and passions of the baser sort do not inflame him. He does not fall a prey to dissipation as easily as might be thought, though he will not refuse pleasure in any form when it has the proper accompaniments. He is a great traveller and fond of seeing the world. \

 He is honest, and acknowledges his faults, fully appreciates his own brilliancy and does not deny it. 

 He does not need to steal for he can make money too easily. 

 He honestly desires celebrity and gains it. If he relied more on effort and less on brilliancy, he would reach fame more frequently and in greater degree. 

 If he could chain his talents, his brilliancy of mind, body, and endowment, down to a definite line of work, he would dominate the world. As it is, he moves among us a brilliant possibility, a magnificent specimen physically and mentally, a joy, a pleasure, a benefit, but too often, through his versatility, a "Jack-of-all-trades." In his marriage relations the Apollonian is often unhappy.
