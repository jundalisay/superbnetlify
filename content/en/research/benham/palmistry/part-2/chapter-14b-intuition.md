The line of Intuition lies at the side of the hand near the percussion.

It rises on the Mount of Moon, and after describing a curve toward the Plain of Mars, ends on or near the Mount of Mercury.

It occupies the same position as the line of Mercury, but is distinguished from it by its curved formation, though I consider it practically a Mercury line. 

The presence of this line, if well marked, adds greatly to the intuitive faculty of a subject, though this may be only another name for Mercurian shrewdness. These subjects seem to receive impressions for which they cannot account, and to form opinions which are accurate, and yet if asked the reason for these opinions they are unable to give any. 

There seems to be an added faculty of sensitiveness, of keenness in estimating people, and of adroit shrewdness in arriving at correct opinions concerning many of their fellows. Some subjects having this marking are not conscious of these faculties, and upon being asked to give a reason for some statement will tell you that they "feel it in their bones." This faculty of receiving correct impressions from those you meet can be cultivated. 

If a subject be unconscious of such powers and does not use them, he goes along feeling many things concerning other people, but dismisses the impressions from his mind as vain fancies. By. allowing the impressions to take some definite form, for instance, by thinking of each person, "he impresses me favorably, or unfavorably," as the case may be, gradually the impressions will increase. 

 first a subject may impress him unfavorably; the next impression may be that the subject is not honest or truthful, or that he is playing some part and not showing his real character. As he begins to put the impressions into words and give them form, they increase, and the ability to receive and. classify them increases. 

I have noted this mark in the hands of celebrated spirit mediums (552), who tell me that their inspirations seem to "come to them"; that impressions about their visitors form in their minds, they often have mental pictures, and, as they come to rely upon these intuitions, they find them increasing in number and accuracy. Whatever intuition is, it operates to give a mental impression from one person to another, and those who have the line of Intuition in their hands seem to be endowed in the highest degree with the faculty of receiving these impressions.

If with a line of Intuition the hand be square, hard, and few lines be seen, the subject will dismiss his intuitions as foolishness. If the fingers be long, tips pointed, Mount of Moon full, Head line sloping, tip of thumb pointed, and a line of Intuition be seen, the subject will be a " Psychic." 

He will have visions, dreams, strong impressions of impending danger, and will see signs and believe in omens. He is dreamy, nervous, highly strung, and wears out easily. From this class genuine " Psychics" are recruited. They have been supposed to be those who can obtain the greatest proficiency in occult studies. 

They do not, however, for they do not want to study or work, but wish to rely entirely upon their impressions and visions, and, except in rare cases, never accomplish as much in any line as do those who use industrious effort thoughtfully expended. A deep line of Intuition will indicate the greatest amount of intuition, and broken or defective lines will show only a limited amount.

Islands in the line will show that the faculty will bring poor success, and islands in the beginning of a line of Intuition indicate a tendency toward somnambulism (553). If the line of Head sinks low on the Mount of Moon and the line of Intuition cuts it, the mental forces will be injured by allowing too much imagination and intuition to have play. If a branch rises from a line of Intuition and runs to the Mount of Jupiter, the subject will be ambitious to accomplish something with his intuitive faculties; these are successful occultists (554).

If a line rises from the Hue of Intuition to the Mount of Apollo (555), the subject will achieve renown through the exercise of his intuitive faculties. If a hue from the line of Intuition cuts the Saturn line (556), the exercise of the intuitive faculties will impair the career of the subject.

In all of these cases the subject will probably use these faculties as a medium or clairvoyant. If the line of Intuition ends in a star (557), the subject will have great success from the exercise of these faculties. If the Mercury development be strong, the subject will make money from the exercise of his intuitive faculties, or can do so if he wishes. 

If the Mercury development be bad the subject will resort to tricks and imposition to make money from the intuitive faculties. If crosses be seen on the line it adds to this indication. These are humbug clairvoyants, mediums, and fortunetellers. 

If a line from the line of Intuition merges into the Saturn line (558), the exercise of the intuitive faculties will assist the career of the subject. With good common-sense to back it, this line is a help to any hand. If the subject be so constituted that he is likely to become unbalanced from believing he is a medium or clairvoyant, a line of Intuition is a poor possession. With a careful estimate of the Chirognomic indications you can apply the line and tell what its effect will be on any subject, and this is the proper use to make of it.


The line which has received the name of Via Lascivia is seldom seen, but should run so as to form itself into a sister line to the line of Mercury (559). 

It is generally supposed to occupy a slanting position rising from the inside of the base of the Mount of Moon and terminating on the lower part of the upper Mount of Moon near the percussion. 

The cause for its name was the fact that with a strong line of Mercury and a sister line beside it, the subject would have a superabundance of vitality and good health, and would work off a good part of it in lascivious practices. 

This might be the case if the type of the subject's hands were sensual, but if they were not, he could just as easily, and would be much more likely to expend his surplus energy in the sphere of activity in which the type of his hands placed him. Because it occupies a slanting position, and does not rise to the top of the hand was another reason why the line was taken as indicating an operation in the lower world located at the base of the hand. 

If a Via Lascivia be deep and clearly marked, it will undoubtedly have a strong tendency to lower the subject in some directions. 

He will be more apt to think evil, even if he does not practise it, and temptation will more surely cause him to fall than if the marking were not in his hand. With a soft, pleasure-loving hand, full Mount of Venus, and a well-marked Via Lascivia, the subject will devote himself to pleasure, and will pursue it regardless of the cost in dollars and cents or in consequences.

If the Via Lascivia be seen, estimate carefully and at once the appetites of the subject, and the likelihood that he will be led where pleasure calls, and if any indication be seen that he is a voluptuary, the line will be a menace to his career. If with such a line the Head line becomes defective, the excesses are affecting the brain. 

If with such a hand the Saturn line have islands, pleasure seeking will cause financial embarrassment. If with such a hand a dot or cross be seen on the Apollo line or Mount, the excesses of the subject will ruin his reputation. If a chance line run from a deep Via Lascivia and cut the line of Affection which ends in a fork (560), the lasciviousness of the subject will ruin his married life. 

If a rising branch from the Via Lascivia cut the Apollo line (561), the lascivious tendencies will ruin the success of the subject. The same reading applies to the line of Saturn. If a chance line from the Via Lascivia cross the Life line (562), the lascivious practices of the subject will injure his health and cause illnesses. 

If after such cutting lines the Life line becomes defective or in any way impaired, the excesses will permanently injure the subject's health. If bars from the Via Lascivia cut the Mercury line (563), the excesses will injure the health and prospects of the subject. 

If a chance line from the Via Lascivia run to a dot in the Life line (564), the excesses will cause a severe illness at the age which the dot indicates. 

If numerous lines from the Via Lascivia run across the Head line (565), the excesses will weaken and impair the brain, the subject will have many headaches, and if a dot, deep bar, break, or cross occurs in the Head line after these cutting lines, the subject will have an attack of brain fever. 

If with such a combination a star be seen in the Head line he may become insane as the result of excesses. If a well-marked Via Lascivia be seen, with a strong line of Mars, all the lines deep and red, big Mount of Venus, thick third phalanges and short first phalanges, the subject will debauch himself continually, and if a thick or a clubbed thumb be added, will commit rape, brutal murder, arson, or any crime to accomplish his desires or to hide their commission. 

If the hand be not so animal, but the line of Mars sweeps across to the Mount of the Moon, and the Via Lascivia is present (566), the subject will drink heavily and commit intolerable excesses. If the Via Lascivia is present as a sister line to the Mercury line, it will repair that line wherever defective. 

A wavy line of Mercury with a Via Lascivia will not indicate the bad results from biliousness that would occur without it. A broken line of Mercury with a Via Lascivia will not indicate such serious stomach trouble.

If the Via Lascivia only runs part of the way alongside the Mercury line its strength will be exerted during the time it continues. Whatever period the Via Lascivia covers on the Mercury line will be correspondingly stronger as a result of the companionship. If a Mercury line runs to the Mount of Mercury, the subject will have good health and success. If the Via Lascivia runs beside this line this reading will be doubly certain. 

The Via Lascivia, it will thus appear, has a good side as well as a bad one. To determine which to attribute to a client, estimate him thoroughly Chirognomically. 

A strong Via Lascivia in a low, animal hand will be read as a menace, and danger of excess. The same line in a fine, high-minded type of hand should be read to indicate fine results. Thus Chirognomy and good judgment must again form the foundation upon which the reading of the line will rest, and with these guides you need never fail in accuracy.
