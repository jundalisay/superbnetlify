There are 2 ways to read the age on lines of Affection:

1. What age the affection occurs

Use the Heart line as a lower mark, and the top of the Mount of Mercury as the upper. 

This space must be subdivided into the average years of life, bringing the middle of the Mount at 36, and the top at 70 years. Thus:
- all lines of Affection appearing before the middle of the Mount occur before 36 years old. 
- those appearing beyond the centre of the Mount occur after 36. 

The scale (316) will be found approximating the correct ages and accurate enough for all general purposes. It can, however, be still further subdivided if more exact dates are desired.

2. How long it lasts 

Measure the line from its beginning to its termination. In this way also, events in the course of an affection are often recorded. 

The scale of measurement for such readings begins with the starting of the line and ends with its termination, the line to be divided in the middle as age 36, and 70 as the end. 

The intervening years can be subdivided as minutely as is necessary in order to reach the age of any markings on the line which is desired (317). 


The longer the line of Affection, the longer the affection continues. 
- When a number of lines are seen, the duration of each affair may be estimated by the length of the several lines. 
- The age at which each occurs is read from the Mount subdivided
- The duration is read from the length of the line. 

By this method, read:
- the number of strong attachments the subject has had and
- how long each one lasts

By the longest and deepest line, determine which one has been deeper than the rest (318). 
- This marking will indicate several deep attachments, finally culminating in the all-absorbing affection shown by the deep line. 

If two lines run alongside of each other and are of the same depth (319) the subject has loved two persons equally well at the same time. 

![316](/graphics/palm/affection2.png)

In every case, the highest line of Affection is the last one which has occurred. 

Any lines lower than it will record former affections. 

If a number of lines be seen, the upper one a deep line, but one of the early lines deep at the end, it indicates that the early love has never entirely disappeared (320). 



From every combination of lines:
- select the strongest attachments from the deepest lines, and
- determine by the character of the lines how completely this attachment has passed away. 

If the last Hue be a thin one, and yet by its length and confirmatory signs proves to be the Marriage line, and if a stronger line lie close under it (321) the subject has married for convenience, or money, but not from strongest love.

If the lines of Affection are thin in proportion to other lines in the hand, the subject has no real strong affections. 
- He has a brotherly affection for his wife, but love will not be the absorbing passion.
- These subjects are<!--  giving little demonstration of affection --> indifferent to affection and are cold. 
  - If they have many lines of Affection, are apt to be flirts. 
  - If such Subjects are handsome, they break many hearts. 

If in a woman's hand the lines of Affection are broad and shallow, or chained, the subject is still more indifferent. 
- She will lead suitors on for the pleasure of disappointing them. 
- These subjects have no real affection, and are selfish, cold, and cruel. 

White color will add to the coldness of both of these latter lines. 

The deep and well-cut lines show deep, lasting affection.
- These are strengthened if they be also pink or red in color. 
- Such subjects love ardently, constantly, and make sacrifices for those they love. 
- It is their pleasure and pride to be constant and true. 

If such a deep line ends without fault or break, the subject will pursue a life of ardent attachment, of reliability and steadfastness, from beginning to end. 

If the line start deep and gradually grow thin, the subject will gradually lose the strength of his attachment (322).

If the line start thin and gradually become stronger, the subject will grow stronger in his attachment (323). 

If an island appear on the line of Affection, there will be some unhappiness during the course of the affection (324).

If the line of Affection is composed of islands, the subject will never have affection enough for anyone to marry him (325). 

![322](/graphics/palm/affection4.png)

If a cross be seen on the line of Affection there will be a serious impediment to the affection (326). 

If this line end in a star the affection will terminate in an explosion (327). 

If a line of Affection send a branch into the Mount of Apollo which ends in a star, the subject will have an affection for someone brilliant and famous (328). 

![322](/graphics/palm/affection5.png)

If the line of Affection fork at its termination (329), the affection will separate and become less strong. 
- Older palmists use this as a sign of divorce. 
- It is a likelihood of interference in the married life, but not always divorce. 
- It shows the beginning of the dissipation of the affections. 

If the fork is not wide (330), the estrangement is not so serious as if it diverge greatly, as in No. 329. 

If the line end in a trident or a tassel, it shows the utter dissipation and scattering of the affection (331).

![322](/graphics/palm/affection6.png)

If branches droop from the line of Affection the married life will be full of sorrows and disappointments (332).

If branches rise from the line of Affection, the subject will be uplifted and the affection will be a benefit to him (333). 

If the line be broken it will indicate that the affection is interfered with or broken in some way (334).

Look for repair signs. 

If the break is enclosed in a square, the subject will recover the disturbed affection (335). 

If the line makes a hook on the Mount, the subject will lose his affection, which will not be regained (336). 

A dot on a line of Affection shows an impediment to the course of the affections (337). 
- The termination of the line shows the outcome. 

![322](/graphics/palm/affection8.png)

If the line ends in a fork, trident, or tassel the affection will be dissipated (338).

If after the dot, the line grows thin, the affection disappears gradually (339).

If Worry lines run from the Mount of Venus to the lines of Affection, and cut these lines, it shows that relatives are interfering with the married life of the subject (340).

## Cutting Lines

If the cutting line runs from Influence lines on the Mount of Venus, it can show how close is the kinship of the relative who is causing the difficulty. 

If a line from a close line of Influence cuts a forked line of Affection, the married life of the subject will be interfered with by a near relative (341). 

The forked line shows that the subject loses some enjoyment of the marriage relation through this interference. 

If the line of Affection end in a tassel, the reading is intensified (342). 


If a line of Affection cut by a bar has a chance line running to an island, a cross, a bar, or a dot in the Head line, an interference with the married life of the subject will result in some form of brain disturbance (343). 


![322](/graphics/palm/affection10.png)

In this manner, chance lines will be seen running from obstructions in the line of Affection to various parts of the hand, sometimes to defective Life lines, or health defects of the Mounts. 

In all these cases, the trouble pointed to will be brought on by an interference or blemish seen in the line of Affection. Each one of these defects in the line of Affection will indicate an event in the life of the subject. 

In all cases the lines of Affection should be read in combination with Influence lines on the Mount of Venus. As both relate to the coming into the life of a new factor, viz., someone outside of the subject himself, they are interdependent.

Be careful interpreting the marriage and home life. The goal of palmistry is to <!--  an examination of the hand is to --> give a client a better knowledge of himself. 

Unless the matter of marriage is so interwoven with his existence that the two seem inseparable, it is only gratifying curiosity to deal with it, and does no real good. 

When his career is being ruined or interfered with by adverse influences, these matters should be pointed out. Merely to tell about them in order to show whether you can do it or not, is lowering the standard of the profession. 


<!-- A surgeon would not amputate a limb to show that he knew how to amputate. , but he would do so if the limb needed amputating and the operation would help the patient.

 All palmists should proceed upon that idea. Do what is necessary for the help or guidance of the client, but nothing merely to exhibit skill. A strict adherence to this principle will win in the long run, and nowhere more surely than in the matter of the lines of Affection. -->
