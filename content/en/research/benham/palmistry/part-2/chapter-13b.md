<!-- It is from the type and Chirognomic make-up of a subject that you must determine which interpretation should be given.  -->

In every case, the Girdle shows some nervousness and some ardor. But to reach a correct estimate of the extent of either, you must:
- first correctly estimate the subject
- then apply the line to him. 

If the Mount of Venus is flat and flabby, the Life line running close to the thumb, the color white, the third phalanges of the fingers waist-like, and the Heart line thin, a Girdle of Venus will not indicate lasciviousness, for the physical make-up and conditions of the subject preclude the possibility of such a thing. 

This subject will, however, undoubtedly be a prey to intense nervousness and dejection, and hysteria has a fertile soil in which to develop. 

On the other hand, if with a Girdle of Venus the Mount of Venus be large, swollen, and grilled, the third phalanges of the fingers thick, the first phalanges short, the Life line running wide into the palm, Heart line deep and red, the Mounts of Mars full, and the color of the hand red, with black or any approach to auburn or red hair on the hands, it should never be read as indicating nervousness and hysteria, but as the greatest lasciviousness possible, added to a taste for drink and general debauchery. 

A Girdle of Venus on such a hand must be given the full strength of its old traditional interpretation. 

All of the nervousness in such a subject will become nervous energy which will be expended in gratifying animal appetites. So impress it upon your mind at once that the form of interpretation which you give to the Girdle of Venus must depend entirely upon the kind of subject on which it is seen. 

There is another danger from the Girdle of Venus, which comes to all types of hands which have it. 

This may only be a trausitory danger, or it may result in the formation of a permanent habit if not checked early in life. At the age of puberty, when the youth passes from the child to the adult, subjects with the Girdle of Venus are liable to indulge in self-abuse. In the subject with animal hands this arises from the heat of his passionate nature, which finds its outlet in this way. 

But with such subjects the danger of a continuance of the habit is only slight, for they quickly have relations with the opposite sex, and do not continue self-abuse. In the very nervous hand puberty brings a sense of desire, but in such weak physical natures this is largely a menial condition. 

There is no real heat or warmth of physical passion, but the mind becomes inflamed and has lascivious dreams. Such subjects are full of imagination but weak in physical heat. It gives them greater delight to think of intercourse than the actual experience would bring them. With such subjects, when the age of puberty gives them a knowledge of desire, they easily fall victims to the habit of self-abuse. 

If the lower third of the Mount of Moon be largely developed, with a thin, bony hand, fiat Mount of Venus, Girdle of Venus, waisteti third phalanges of the fingers, deficient Mounts of Mars, and thin Heart line (524), the subject will, because of his imaginings, commit the act of self-abuse. 

These subjects are hard to break of the habit, for their lack of real physical heat makes them prefer self-abuse to actual intercourse. 

They are shy, diffident, and retiring by nature, and neither court nor love the society of people in general, or of the opposite sex in particular. Many such subjects are found in the Saturnian type. When such a hand is seen, if you look into the upturned palm intently, then at the subject without saying a word, an oozy perspiration will soon begin to form in the palm.

This will become more plentiful the longer you continue the experiment. 

Such subjects will not often deny the charge of self-abuse. If these indications are seen in the bands of children, good wholesome advice and plain talks from the parents will often prevent the formation of this vicious habit.

The Girdle of Venus is usually a single deep line. 

This is most often seen on the least nervous hands, and is for this reason not so frequently an indication of hysteria as of increase of animal appetites. Often the Girdle is composed of broken fragments (525). This will increase the nervousness, the danger of hysteria, and also the retiring disposition. 

If such subjects fall into bad practices, the habits are very hard to overcome. 

If the Girdle of Venus be composed of double or triple lines, which is often the case (526), it will make its indication, whether of health or temperament, doubly strong. If the Girdle be composed of a number of broken lines (527) and the rest of the hand be a nervous one, the danger from hysteria is great and all nervous symptoms will be intensified. 

If with such a marking there are indications of female trouble (528) the subject will be a great sufferer, and nervous depression, ill-health, and constant discontent and unhappiness will surround her. These subjects should be taken to a specialist, who may relieve them, but often the real trouble is not known. With such a marking you will frequently find very defective Life and Head lines.

If the Head line in this case should have islands, dots, crosses, or a star on it, there will be grave danger of insanity (529). The ultra-nervous condition shown by a bad Girdle of Venus will have its effect upon every phase of life. Defects in the Saturn or Apollo lines may be accounted for by a bad Girdle of Venus. 

They may come from either lascivious ness or ill-health; which one may be indicated by a Chirognomic examination and by the Main lines. With the Girdle of Venus, a factor which may be so potent in its operation, there will be many combinations in which it will play an important part. If the Head line slopes low into the Mount of Moon, and on it or near its termination a star, dot, cross, or island be seen, with a broken Girdle of Venus, and many lines in the hand (530), the subject is in grave danger of insanity, as a result of intense nervousness and excessive imagination.

This subject will be erratic, cranky, and hard to get along with. If a cross be seen on the Mount of Saturn, a broken Girdle of Venus, dots or islands in the Head line under Saturu, a grille on the Mount of the Moon, with brittle or fluted nails, the subject will be in grave danger from paralysis (531). If the hand be thick at the base, fingers thick, color red, lines deep and red, with a deep Girdle of Venus, and the lines of Life and Head short and ending in defects, the subject will be likely to die very suddenly at the age at which the Life line ends, as a result of dissipation and excess (532). 

If the hand be sensual in formation, with a Girdle of Venus which cuts a troubled Saturn line deeply, and a dot be seen on the Mount of Apollo, or on the Apollo line near the termination, the excesses of the subject will ruin his career and end in the entire loss of his reputation (533).

It will be noted in the foregoing illustrations that the Chirognomic type of the hand is taken into account, and that a broken Girdle of Venus indicates the nervous condition and a deep Girdle indicates its excessive side. 

If a deep Girdle of Venus cuts a line of Affection, the Heart line has drooping lines from it, the Head line becomes defective toward the end and terminates in a star, and the Saturn line is cut by a bar which stops it, the excesses of the subject will ruin his married life and cause great sorrow, finally ending in an impairment of the mental faculties, insanity, and the ruining of his career (534). 

You will meet the Girdle of Venus in all kinds of hands. 

Some of the best men and women have had it, and their careers have never suffered. It has been argued that the added warmth imparted by the Girdle of Venus gives a greater richness to the character that can hold it within bounds. From this standpoint it would be considered as an absolute blessing. 

But its presence may produce unpleasant results and in many ways. The difficulty of telling which meaning to give the Girdle is made easy when you fit the line to the type of hand which has it, and do not try to fit lasciviousness to every person on whom the Girdle is seen. 

A poor, trembling, nervous, cold-handed subject with a Girdle of Venus should not be told that he indulges in great excesses, for to such an one an extra cup of coffee or tea would mean great dissipation, and yet it is on such subjects that you will find a large percentage of Girdles. 

Good judgment and a clean way of looking at things must be displayed in handling the Girdle of Venus, which, used with discrimination, will produce only good results for the practitioner. There are those who seek unpleasant sides to every character, and for such the Girdle has peculiar charms, but in the largest number of cases, pity and tenderness should be the feeling it inspires.
