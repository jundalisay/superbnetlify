In most hands, there are 2 places where the Saturn line shows the greatest number of defects or difficulties.

1. At the start of the line, which period covers events brought into the child's life by his parents, and which show the manner in which he is started in life. 

If the Saturn line at this period is deep and strong, he will have little difficulty in getting started in life. 

Usually, those who have the best kind of a start often fall into trouble later on because they never experienced adversity. 
- They do not know how to act under adversity and how to take its consequent hard knocks.

There seems to be a given amount of experience necessary to each individual, and if he does not receive this at one time he does at another. 

Those hands on which the Saturn line is defective at the start, generally improve, for the subject having adversity when young, early learns to avoid the dangers that beset him and becomes able to do for himself.

2. The age between 30-45

In most hands, this fills the period or space between the Head and Heart lines. 

This is the critical time in most business careers, and is the formative financial period in life. 

In most hands before this age the subject has been cared for and guided by parents or relatives. As the time approaches when these aids are no longer so closely depended upon, the subject begins to be guided by his own ideas. 

If these be good, he gets along all right, but if he believes that the experience of others will not apply to him, he will have disappointments, and will have to "pay for his experience." During the period of life indicated by the space between the Head and Heart lines, sometimes beginning earlier than this, the greatest number of defects are generally seen in the Saturu line. 

Between childhood and 25 years old, most Saturn lines are deep. 

Many hands has defective Saturn lines from 30-45 (393). 

It often becomes good afterwards, and often no Hue is seen after 45. 

All of the defects seen during thirty to forty-6ve years are disastrous in proportion as they are destructive to the line of Saturu, and must be so estimated. 

Often the line gets thin as it approaches the Head line, and often the breaks and defects come into a deep strong line. When the entire space between the Head and Heart lines is filled with an island, there will be continuous financial difficulty during all of these years (394). If during this period the line be wavy, the career at this time will be variable (395). If in this portion of the line a break should be repaired by a square, one side of which continues, the subject will have a serious reverse at the age indicated, but will be able to get through it (396)- 

If the Saturn lines between Head and Heart line be covered with crosses, the subject will have repeated reverses which he will withstand if the line continues after this period, but which will overcome him if it does not (397). If this portion of the Saturn line be cut with cross-bars, the subject will meet with obstacles to his career (398). 

If the line cuts through these bars and severs them, the subject will overcome the difficulties; but if these bars cut the Saturn line he will have great difficulty in doing so. If this portion of the Saturn line be cut by chance lines from the Head line, the difficulties will arise from errors of judgment (399).

If the Saturn line during this period be cut by chance lines from the Heart line, the subject permits his affections to get the better of him, and sentiment in business is disastrous (400). If the Life line be defective, and chance lines from it cut the Saturn line at the period between thirty and forty-five, ill health has obstructed the career during the financial formative period (401). If an Influence line on Mount of Venus ends in a star, and a Worry line from it cuts the Saturn line between the lines of Head and Life, the death of a relative will obstruct the career at this period (402). If this Worry line cuts a rising line from the Life line, the death of a relative will bring on a check to the upward career of the subject (403). It must be understood that defects in any part of the line must be read at the age they occur.

All lines do not show all of their defects in childhood or the formative period. I emphasize these two periods because they are most frequently found defective, but the indications given for those parts of the line apply to any defective period, and all supports or strengthening influences act equally well upon any portion of the line. It has been customary to read any line rising at the base of the hand and running to the various Mounts as a Saturn line, with success coming from the attributes of the Mount on which it terminates. The Saturn line cannot end on any Mount but Saturn, with the one exception that it may run to Jupiter. 

If the Saturn line runs through its usual course in the centre of the hand and ends on the Mount of Jupiter, the success of the subject will be the result of great ambition (404). If the Saturn line be deep and rises from inside the Life line ending on the Mount of Jupiter, the influence of relatives and great ambition unite to make the career of the subject a success (405). If the Saturn line rises inside the Life line runs deep for a while and then becomes defective, the assistance of relatives and ambition help for a while, but do not bring ultimate success (406). 

At the point where the ill success begins, look for a cause. This may be ill health, loss of mental power, unhappy environment, or some special disease. If such a Saturn line be seen, and a Worry line, cutting a rising line from the Life line, crosses the hand and cuts a forked line of Affection, an unhappy marriage has injured the prospects of the subject (407). In the same manner the death of a relative, outside influences, ill health, will be shown by chance lines running from the cause of the trouble and cutting the Saturn line. Sometimes bad defects are seen, but chance lines do not connect them with the Saturn line. 

These defects are, however, the cause of the trouble. If a Saturn line rises on the Mount of the Moon and runs deep and strong to the Mount of Jupiter, the influence of one of the opposite sex together with the great ambition of the subject cause his prosperity (408). If the confirmations of marriage be present, the influence will be husband or wife.

If a Saturn line running in this manner be defective in any part, the combination of influences has not been sufficient to prevent trouble. When a line rises at the base of the hand and runs to the Mount of Apollo or Mercury, I regard it as the line belonging to the Mount toward which it runs, and not the Saturn line. 

A line running toward Upper Mars is also likely to be the Mercury line, consequently in practice it is best to consider as a line of Saturn, only lines which run through the centre of the hand. If such lines are then deflected toward the Mounts, it is proper to read them as Saturn lines, strongly influenced by the Mount to which they run (409). 

If such a Saturu line ends on Upper Mars, the subject will achieve success from his leadership, power of resistance, and because he does not become discouraged (410). All of these indications will be accented if the Mounts be large and well developed. If the Saturn line runs in its usual course, but a line branches from it to Mount of Jupiter, the subject's success will be largely their due to ambition and ability to command men and obtain support. 

Such a line is a fine one for a politician (411). If a Saturn line which runs to the Mount of Saturu have a branch rising to the Mount of Apollo, the subject will win success in art, business, or as an actor, according to which phalanx of the Apollo finger rules (412). If a Saturn line have one branch rising to Jupiter, and one to Apollo, the subject will have an assured future of wealth and fame, for ambition and the Jupiterian attributes, the wisdom of Saturn, with brilliancy, art, and business from Apollo, are all united to assist him to a rich harvest (413). This is the most favorable combination possible. If the Saturn line have a branch rising to Mercury, the subject will have the assistance of shrewdness, business ability, good power of expression, and a scientific turn of mind to assist in his success (414). If a Saturn line have a branch rising and joining but not cutting the Head line, the subject will have the assistance of a good head in the shaping of his career (415).

The termination of the line will show the outcome of the career.

In many hands, the line does not reach the Mount of Saturn but ends somewhere below it. 

Indicating as it does the periods of productive capacity, it is not strange that it should be absent in old age, for at this time disease or delicacy generally makes the career negative. The presence of a Mount without a line shows at least that no forces are working against the subject, and if the line be good in its early course it shows that a productive life is behind him, and it will be found that he is enjoying in old age the result of his early labors. 

On some Mounts a deep line is seen. This is a strong indication of well-to-do old age. 

In any event the point at which the line ceases, be it in youth or old age, terminates our work with it, except that we can say to those whose line has stopped and no other has taken its place, that the future is as they make it.

If a deep line runs only for 25 years, the subject can be promised a productive period only during that time; the period after it, is as be makes it by effort.

If the line runs deep for part of the way and terminates in a wavy line (416):
- the career during the latter years will be uncertain
- there will be worries in old age. 

These defective terminations on the Mount may not mean poverty or money losses in old age. But they may mean financial checks to the career from disappointments in children, or similar troubles. 

I mention this in order to warn against reading defective terminations as necessarily meaning poverty when the Saturn line has previously been deep for its entire course. 

Breaks in the line, bars cutting it, crosses or dots following a hitherto deep line, will indicate trials and crosses in old age. If the Saturn line breaks on the Mount, and the Life, Head, and Heart lines be defective at the same age, ill health in old age will render the last days ones of trouble (417). 

If the Saturn line end in an island and downward branches be seen on the Life line with a long tassel, financial difficulties due to ill health will cloud the last days of the subject (418). 

If the line be crossed by bars which cut it on the Mount, the subject will suffer losses and trials in old age (419). If the bars be faint and do not cut the line they are troubles and worries. If the line has crosses on the Mount, great trials and misfortunes will harass the latter years of the subject (420). 

All of these terminations apply to the line on the Mount of Saturn, and have their various indications in old age. If the line terminate in these signs at any age the reading will be the same, except that it applies to the age indicated on the line at the time at which it occurs. If the line be defective during its entire course and terminates in any of these signs, the indication will be worse than when these markings terminate a deep line, for in the first instance the subject will not have a prosperous life behind him, during which he might have provided for old age. No. 421 will give various examples of such defective lines.

We have now followed the Saturn line from babyhood to extreme old age, and have seen how it records success and failure, as well as the causes which have produced them. It is poor consolation for one to look back upon a life of meagre fruitage and say, -->


People will say "If I had only known the productive periods, the end might have been different." 

This<!--  oft-repeated exclamation --> is sadly true, for in only few lives are productive periods taken advantage of in their fullest measure. 

If by a careful application of the rules laid down in this chapter you are enabled to help struggling humanity to make use of the harvest portion of their lives, and thus provide for the days when vital forces wane, and labor can no longer be done, you will have wasted no time which has been spent in a study of the line of Saturn.
