The lines of Affection or Marriage:
- are on the Mount of Mercury
- run from the percussion toward the inside of the palm.

In some hands, there are none of these lines. In others, many are seen.

From time immemorial, older palmists used them to show marriage<!--  or unions of the sexes -->.

Their value in practice is considerable if:
- used up to their limit, and
- in combination.

But used by themselves, as a hard-and-fast indication of marriage, they will lead to constant error.

Marriage does not affect every subject in the same way. 

Some people see marriage as performing any ordinary routine of daily life.
- Such persons will have no Marriage lines.

<!-- a  are no more impressed on entering into this relation than if they were  -->

Others sink their whole life and soul into a union. 
- These will have deep Marriage lines.

Using "marriage" with the lines of Affection is misleading because <!-- , for it is in no sense to be taken as always indicating --> it does not mean a legal marriage contract.

These lines show <!-- are often seen when no such contract has ever been entered into, but --> when the subject has loved as fondly, as if he were married<!--  had been joined in wedlock -->.
- In such people, a line of union will appear the same as though they were married. <!--  ceremony had been performed. -->

The lines of Affection relate only to persons of the opposite sex, and those who are in no way related to us by blood. 

<!-- More properly speaking, these are lines of deep affection rather than lines of marriage or union, and, viewed from this standpoint, they are remarkably accurate. -->

In every case, there must have been a profound impression made on the subject by an affection before these lines will be strong.
- The more impressions and affections he had, the more of these lines of Affection will be seen in the hand.

<!-- The Lines Of Affection 464 No. 313. -->

The type of the subject is a great help in reading these lines, as each type has distinct views on marriage.

The Jupiterian is inclined to marriage and to marry young. In him, a line of Affection early in life will most often be correctly read as marriage.

The Saturnian dislikes marriage and does not rush into marriage.<!--  ; if he be of a very pronounced or at all bad development, and even in good specimens of the type, a Saturnian  the marriage state. -->
- This type does not naturally love his fellow-creatures
- A most profound impression must be made on him by someone before he will enter marriage.
- Consequently in a Saturnian, this line should be:
  - very strong
  - occur well toward middle life for it to be read as marriage.

Even when the combination of a Mount of Venus shows a Saturnian to be possessed of sexual desire, he will prefer to gratify these appetites outside of the marriage state rather than to tie himself permanently to anyone.

Apollonians desire to marry, and do so when young. 

But they often make unhappy marriages because while they like brilliant partners, they do not always get them.

Lines of Affection on Apollonians will be quite safely read as marriages.

Mercurians are great matchmakers. They also marry quite young.
- On this type, lines of Affection will very often mean marriage.

Martians are prone to marry, so with this type lines of Affection also have full meaning.

Lunarians are very peculiar about marriage, sometimes despising it, and sometimes making odd matches, and the line of Affection on this type must be excessively strong to be read as marriage. 

Venusians cannot keep from marrying, even if they cared to, for they will not be allowed to remain single, because other persons are so attracted to them.

On the Venusian type it requires only a small line to mean marriage, though on this type you will generally find strong lines.

It is ridiculous to predict marriages based on each line in the Mount of Mercury.

<!-- The practice of looking at the Mount of Mercury, and predicting one, two, or as many marriages as there are lines of Affection on the Mount, is a most inaccurate and unscientific thing to do, constantly leading to error, and making our science ridiculous. -->

<!-- No practitioner should say in advance, as is the custom with many professionals, that he can tell about marriage. -->

<!-- Many professionals in their printed circulars claim to tell a client "everything concerning love, marriage, divorce, etc.," and such professionals are kept continually in hot water by their mistakes.
If they did not promise what they could not perform, there would be no trouble. The only honest way is to make no promises, for you cannot tell what a hand will show until it has been seen. -->

<!-- It may be asked, "Why is it necessary to deal with marriage at all?" The answer to this question is, that  -->

Marriages do so much to make or to mar one's career. This is why all information should be had for use in its general bearing on the subject's life. 
- I <!-- My only object in --> introduce the lines of Affection <!-- at this point is that we may be able to bring them to bear --> so we can see their powerful influence on the lines of Saturn and Apollo<!-- , which they often powerfully influence -->. 

The first thing to determine is whether lines of Affection is present. 
- If none is seen, your subject is not likely to be powerfully impressed by anyone. 

If the subject is robust and ardent, he may have strong desires toward the opposite sex. But when these are satisfied, he relapses into indifference, until the superabundance of vitality again turns his thoughts back in the same direction. 

These subjects are undemonstrative, and a defective Heart line in a hand which has no line of Affection will indicate heart disease and not affection. 

If many lines of Affection are present (314) the subject is susceptible in affairs of the heart, more or less seriously so as the lines are strong or weak. 

These lines of Affection are always cross-lines, and start from the outside of the hand, sometimes at the back cutting around into the Mount of Mercury. 

If only a single line is seen, there will be but one deep affection. 

<!-- They are never an indication of the love a subject may have for his family. The Lines Of Affection 465 No. 314. -->

A line beginning with a fork (315) shows that the affection is of unusual strength, the two lines of the fork having united to form a single line, producing the effect of two Currents turned into one, which thus takes on double strength.
