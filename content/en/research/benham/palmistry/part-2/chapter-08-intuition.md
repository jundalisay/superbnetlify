The Lines of Influence are on the Mount of Venus and inside the Life line. 
- Some of these run parallel to the Life line. 
- Others run across the Mount (277). 

These introduce factors outside of the subject himself as his "environment." 

<!-- Only those indications which my own experience as well as that of other careful investigators has fully verified are here considered, and all matters which are traditional or hypothetical have been left out.  -->

The Hindus have an elaborate system of using these lines of Influence<!-- , and depend upon them for a large part of their work -->. 

Only the lines which run inside the Life line are properly lines of Influence. These show that <!-- 
- These indicate --> persons have strongly influenced the life either for good or bad. Such persons are:
- the members of one's own family or
- the closest of friends. 
  - In this case, these friends have grown into the life and have become a part of it. 

<!-- In all cases they have strong influence, hence their name. In some hands few of these lines are seen, in others there are many, and the more there are the greater the number of persons who have exerted strong influence.  -->

**The less the number of such lines, the more self-contained is the subject.** 

He makes few close friendships, and even blood relations do not greatly influence him. 

These lines appear because such influences have made strong impressions on the subject's mind. These mental impressions then show themselves in the hand. 

The Lines of Influence, both vertical and horizontal, form "the Grille on the Mount of Venus". 

This generally indicates an increase of Venusian qualities, particularly the sexual appetites.

<!-- This general reading of a large number of Influence lines on the Mount of Venus is correct, as has been clearly demonstrated in the hands of subjects known to have strong sexual appetites.  -->

Every line of the Grille represents an influence which has affected the life, and the more of these there are, the more the Mount will have Currents which excite it, and consequently fire its qualities. 

The absence of lines on the Mount of Venus shows an absence of electrifying Currents. This calm Mount expends its energy in a love of beauty, gayety, color, art, and dress, instead of in sexual desires.

The line of Mars is a sister to the line of Life, running inside of that line and parallel to it (278). This is really an Influence line, but it is an influence upon the health of the subject, sustaining and strengthening it, and does not relate to the influence of other persons. 

The line of Mars is comparatively a rare marking, and the greater number of lines seen alongside the Life line are simply Influence lines. 

The Influence line which runs closest to the line of Life is the closest influence. 
- This may be mother, father, a brother or a sister. 

A line starting near the beginning of the Life line and running close to it is generally the mother (279) because a mother's influence begins earlier in life than that of any one else. 

Next to this line, counting from the Life line, comes a line representing the father. <!-- , and the line which represents this parent is usually found to be deeper than the others.  -->

Next follow other relatives, grandparents being generally the fourth line. 
- The length of these lines tell the duration of the influences as factors in the life of a subject. 

In most hands a new Influence line is seen to appear at some age between 20 and 30 (280). 

This is generally the husband or wife, as it is at about this age that most marriages occur. This line becomes the dominating influence of the subject from the time of its appearance if the marriage is happy, but it only shows faintly if the marriage has made no more than a passing impression on the subject. 

In many cases, there is a fine line connecting this Influence line with the Life line, showing that the influence has merged into the life of the subject. On the Mount of Venus, then, are congregated the close influences of a subject's life.

Many things which happen to the persons who influence the subject are also shown on the lines of Influence, but they are events which have made a considerable impression on his mind. 

A star on the end of a line of Influence (281) shows the ceasing of that influence.<!-- , whatever it may be; and, while  -->

You cannot state definitely who the person is. But you can determine whether that person is closely connected with the subject or a more distant relative by noting the distance between:
- this Influence line and
- the line of Life. 

**This is an important indication to master thoroughly.** 

The death of a relative will often change the course of a life, and if some indication be encountered which cannot be explained in any other way, a line of Influence with a star on it may give the clew. 

In connection with the lines of Saturn and Apollo it is of constant service. 

The death of relatives also seriously impairs the health of some subjects, and thus in all directions Influence lines are valuable indications. 

When lines of Influence are deep, strong, and well colored, the influence is powerful; when they are thin, shallow, chained, uneven, or broken in any way (282), the influence is not strong. 

When an Influence line begins deep, then grows thin, and fades away, the influence was strong in the beginning, but has gradually grown weaker until it has no effect (283). 

If this line should be revived and gradually grow stronger, the influence will return into the   subject's life and grow in power (284). 

If an Influence line draw away from the Life line and grow thinner at the same time, the influence gradually grows away from its nearness to the subject, and finally disappears (285).

It shows the estrangement of some near one. The ages of each one of these occurrences can be read from the Life line. 

If an Influence line begins early and ends in a star and has beside it a line more distant from the Life line which grows stronger after the star, then it shows that:
- a parent has died
- a distant relative has come into the life and taken the parent's place (286). 

If an Influence line begins thin and grow stronger and break and is replaced by another line, and this by another, it shows that, one after another, relatives have replaced each other as the leading influence with the subject (287). 

If the Life line is very defective (thin, chained, broad, and shallow, islanded or broken), and a line of Influence is strong (288), it shows the subject's health has been delicate, some relative has been his mainstay in life.

Such a line has the same effect on the subject as a line of Mars. The influence may, by constant nursing, have kept the subject alive. 

I prefer this opinion over the idea of the line being a line of Mars. 

If the Head line is poor early in life, and gradually grow stronger, and an Influence line is  strong in the beginning and grow farther away from the Life line or become thinner, the weak mental condition of the subject in early life is sustained by the strong influence of someone during the time such help was needed, and, as the head grew stronger, the influence was no longer needed and faded away (289).

The rising branches from the Life line indicating an upward tendency in the life of the subject are sometimes cut by Worry lines (290). This marking shows an impediment to the career of the subject, a check to the upward tendency. 

These Worry lines frequently start from an Influence line (291), and this will indicate that the influence has caused the check. In a large number of cases these Worry linescutting an upward branch from the Life line have been verified as indicating a legal difficulty. 

<!--  used this marking as an indication of . The single indication must not be given this reading, but with this marking and other confirmatory signs it can be so interpreted, viz.,  -->

If the line cutting the rising branch from the Life line cross the hand and cut a line of union which is forked (292), it can be interpreted as divorce as done by older palmists, but not always so. 


If the Worry line start from an Influence line, the influence has made the trouble. 

By itself the marking indicates a check to the upward career. If a Worry line start from a star on the end of an Influence line and cut a rising line from the Life line (293), it indicates that the death of a relative caused the trouble. 

If the Influence line be deep, then thin, and alternates in this way, the influence is strong, then weak, and only exerts its power spasmodically (294). If an Influence line begin away from the Life line and gradually come toward it, growing stronger as it progresses (295), it indicates that the influence of some distant relative is gradually coming nearer to the life of the subject and growing stronger. 

This line may cut through other Influence lines lying closer to the Life line, showing that it is becoming more powerful than they. 

If a line of Influence break and after a short space start again, and this be repeated, it shows that the influence of the person on the life of the subject vanishes and then begins again, having disappeared and returned several times (296). 

If inside of a broken line of Influence, starting at 20-30, there be another line which begins early in the life of the subject, and continues uninterrupted past these breaks, it shows the intermittent character of the wife or husband's influence, strengthened by the constant influence of the mother or father. 

Often such a marking will heal and correct a poor marriage (297).

Islands on Influence lines parallel to the Life line indicate a delicate condition of the influence, and such a line ending in a star, cross, dot, or cross-bar (298) will indicate that the delicate influence dies, the age to be read from the line of Life. Horizontal lines on the Mount of Venus (299) are persons or events which have crossed our lives and impeded them.

Parallel lines are not impediments, and while they may be weak or defective, they are not influences strongly hostile to our best development. Cross-lines both impede our influences and worry and harass us. This is why these cross lines cutting the Life line have been called Worry lines.

If deep and red, they are serious impediments; if thin and puny lines, they are only annoyances. These Worry lines which continually cross the Life line must be regarded as more or less serious, according to their depth and extent. 

When deep, they indicate serious illness. 

If these horizontal lines cross the entire Mount of Venus and Life line, from top to bottom, they are continuous worries. If only short lines, they are temporary annoyances. If they cut some particular Influence line repeatedly (300), that influence will have a continual life of worry and impediment.
