A person with no Saturn line must depend on himself entirely. He should not trust to luck or fortunate circumstances. But if he would accomplish much in the world, it must be the result of his own efforts. 

The Saturn line may start (344) anywhere between the end of:
- the Life line and
- the Mount of Moon. 

![344](/graphics/palm/344.jpg)


Sometimes the line rises inside the Life line, and sometimes as high as the upper Mount of Moon. 

The course of the Saturn line is always toward the Mount of Saturn. 
- Sometimes, it reaches the Mount
- Sometimes, it falls far short. 

It always runs through the centre of the palm. 

When the Saturn line rises inside the Life line and runs on to the Mount of Saturn (345) it indicates that the subject will have material success in life, and that near relatives will assist him greatly.

When the line rises from the centre of the palm (346) and runs into the Mount of Saturn, the subject will achieve success in life largely by his own efforts.

When the line rises from the Mount of Moon and runs on to the Mount of Saturn (347) the subject's success in life will be materially assisted by one of the opposite sex.
- This may either be by good advice or by rendering financial aid.
- This is common in men where the wives have been of great assistance in their career.

All other starting points are modifications of one or the other of them. 
- All readings should be modified in proportion as the source of the line is from these three pronounced centres. 

Sometimes, the line does not rise low in the hand, but starts higher up (348). 
- In this case the subject will have a more negative existence for the first part of the life, as this point is the time when he is so young that he can accomplish little by his own efforts
- Such a beginning to the line indicates that he was not born with a " silver spoon in his mouth."

His best period will begin at the time the line starts, for while the absence of the line does not show that influences are at work to prevent the advancement of the subject, the presence of a good line does show that some especial advantages are present during its existence.

- The absence of the line shows that constant effort is needed
- A good line will show that during its best period of formation the greatest efforts should be exerted if the largest results possible are to be achieved.

**The higher in the hand the line starts, the later in life will be the period of easiest sailing.** 

Whenever a deficiency is noted in the Saturn line you will find an explanation in some of the other lines or signs.
- If the Saturn line is absent at the start, the Life line will show great delicacy for the period when the Saturn line is absent (349). 

{{< img src="/graphics/palm/349.jpg" cap="349" alt="349">}}

Thus, the subject did little during the earlier years because he was delicate.

As the Saturn line begins at the time this delicacy ends on the Life line, he will at that time begin a period which he may make productive. 

If the Life line be thin when it begins to recover, and grows thicker as it progresses, and if the Saturn line does the same, the subject will continue to do better in a business way as his strength increases. 

It will be noted that it is necessary to read the beginning of the Saturn line from the bottom and the Life line from the top. 

If with the line rising late we find a defective Head line at the start (350) the subject will have his start in life impeded by brain weakness, and the Saturn line will not grow good until the Head line does. 

If the Head line be weak at the start, and as soon as it recovers the Heart line become weak, the Life line being thin all of this time (351), the career of the subject will be hindered first by head trouble, and then by heart weakness, and he does not begin to do his best until these have passed away. If the line rise high in the hand and the lines of Head or Heart are not defective, you must look for health defects in other parts of the hand, on lines and Mounts, and somewhere you will discover the cause of the absence of the Saturn line. 

Use both hands with the Saturn line. If the line begin low in the left hand and rise high in the right, you will know that the natural course of the line was favorable, but as it shows its defects in the right hand, something has occurred to alter the original plan. This may be health, laziness, or influences from family, friends, or outsiders, and inasmuch as we do not believe that mere chance has produced the alteration we must look somewhere for the unfavorable condition which has prevented the rising of the Saturn line low in the right hand. 

The absence of a Saturn line where it should normally begin will often be explained by some accident to the parents. <!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 2 495 No. 344. The Line Of Saturn Part 2 496 No. 345.

As this early period of the line covers the childhood of the subject, it will not be through his own fault that the start in life is not as good as it should be. If a line of Saturn rise high in the hand, and a line of parental influence on the Mount of Venus end in a star early in the line (352), the death of a parent has prevented a good start in the life of the subject. Remember all indications on the Saturn line refer to financial affairs. Next in order the character of the Saturn line must be noted. 

If the line be not so deep as the other lines on the hand, the indications peculiar to the line are not in their proper proportions and will not be as strong as if all the lines were in balance. If the line be very deep and clear cut (353), the subject will be found to have exceptionally fine qualities, with a proper use of which he should be enabled to achieve great success. 

If this deep line extend up on to the Mount of Saturn, these favorable conditions will continue during the entire life. If the line be short, they will be present only during the length of the line, the age to be read from the line. If this deepness of the line be early in life, the subject will have his best period during childhood (354). 

This is an unfortunate marking, for at this age the subject is seldom old enough to take advantage of opportunities. 

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 3 503 No. 352 The Line Of Saturn Part 3 504 No. 353. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 505 No. 354. The deep line of Saturn is the most favorable line to possess.  -->

A thin line (355) will show that the subject has much in his favor in the way of natural advantages, and while he will have to exert himself more to bring forth great results than a subject with a deep line, he will still have an easier time to succeed than one with a defective line or with no line at all. 

A broad and shallow line (356) indicates a condition little better than no line at all, and if the Saturn line alone be of such a character, while the other lines are well marked, the subject will have continual struggles. A chained line of Saturn indicates that the career will be a hard one. 

If the line be chained, during its entire length, the subject will have continuous obstructions and the life will be a labored one, full of disappointments (357). If chained only part of the way, the difficulties will last during this condition. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 506 No. 355. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 507 No. 356. 

The Line Of Saturn Part 3 508 No. 357. 

Color indicates the strength and condition of the Blood Current. 
- It does not affect the line of Saturn, as it does other lines. 
- This is because this line is not an index of the health or the disease of the subject.<!-- , and thus the line of Saturn will be the first line to which it is unnecessary to apply the color test.  -->
