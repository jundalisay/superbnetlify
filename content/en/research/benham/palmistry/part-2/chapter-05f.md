All lines which rise from a Main line are more favorable than lines which fall from it, so split lines rising from the Heart line are better indications than those which fall below it.

These lines which split from the Heart line will rise to or near a Mount, and will indicate that either the characteristics of the Mount, or someone belonging to that type, so strongly attract the heart as to split off part of the line and draw it up toward the Mount. 

Thus, a split rising from the Heart line under Jupiter (49) will show that ambition will guide love, and the person who will attract this subject will be someone on the Jupiterian order. 

He does not necessarily have to have money, but he must be prominent, or one who gives promise of rising. 

A split line rising under Saturn (50) will indicate that the subject is attracted by some of the Saturnian qualities. 

If the subject, on whose hand you find this line, is developed in his mental world, it will be this side of the Saturnian that will attract him, and he will love one who has scholarly attainments. If your client's middle world is strongest, he will love one who has farming, mining, or horticultural aptitudes, or scientific talents. 

If his lower world is strongest, he will love one who has the saving disposition of the Saturnian. In every case this subject will like best one who has the soberness, caution, and wisdom that belong to the Saturnian type. The subject himself may not belong to the Saturnian type, but he will admire these qualities. 

I have seen the most giddy persons with this marking, and believe they realize their need of the Saturnian balance-wheel. A split line rising under Apollo (51) must be reasoned as in the previous case, and your subject will be drawn toward Apollonians. If your subject lives in the mental world, he will love one who is ideally an artist. If the middle world of your subject is strongest, he will love one who is an artist, but he wants this artist able to make money from his art. 

If the lower world is strongest your subject will love one who dresses in a showy fashion and who knows how to make a display. Remember the Apollonian, and that this split line from the line of Heart makes the subject love the qualities of that type; you can carry your explanation as far as you please by describing all that Apollonians are, and saying that this is what your client will love.

If the split line rises to Mercury (52), your subject will love Mercurian qualities. 
- The rule of the upper world of Mercury will show oratory and eloquence
- The rule of the middle world of Mercury is the scientific side
- The rule of the lower world of Mercury is the money-making side
  - The subject will suffer love to be influenced by the amount of money a lover has, or by his ability to make it. 

<!-- If these split lines rise in the centre of the Mounts, read them confidently.  -->

If it seems doubtful on which of 2 Mounts they do end, estimate which one seems most clear and read in this case with some degree of reserve. <!-- Good judgment must be constantly cultivated.  -->

Split lines which fall from the Heart line (53) show a part of the conflict between heart and head, and at the time these lines fall, the head is exerting a very strong influence. 

If, as is often the case, fine lines fall from the Heart line all along its course, there is a perpetual conflict between heart and head for the mastery. These falling lines were read by old palmists to indicate "love-sorrows and disappointments." 

When we think that they do indicate an effort of the head to control sentiment or heart, we can understand how it was reasoned out, for if one loves but allows the head to say that the loved one is not so good a match as someone else, he will have "love-sorrows and disappointments," for calculation (head) has stifled sentiment (heart).

Sometimes a large line will split away from the Heart line and gradually fall to the Head line, merging itself in it (54); this will show that heart has surrendered to head and is thereafter ruled by it. The age at which it begins is shown by the point at which the line splits away, and the complete surrender by the point at which the line loses itself in the line of Head. 

Cross-bars cutting the line (55) are constant heart irritations, either illness, or worries in the affections. On noting them make a search to locate whether they are health defects or whether they apply to the affections. If health defects note how deeply they cut. 

If only little lines they show temporary heart disturbance of a functional character, if very deep they are more serious; so note all these lines carefully, to see how disastrous they will be in their effect. 

If these cross-bars cut the line in many places, it shows that the trouble is continuous. 

If heart disease, it will show palpitation and valvular difficulties, and generally with such bars present the Heart line grows dim and more defective toward its latter end, and the cross-bars become deeper cut. If these bars do not relate to disease, then constant jars to the affections will be indicated at the age at which these bars show on the line.

All defects on the Heart line are more serious if they appear under the Mount of Apollo. 

Islands in the Heart line (56) are always defects. 
- They obstruct the Current, weaken it, and most often indicate weak physical action of the heart. 
- The size of the island will show how serious the difficulty is. 
- Mere dots are not more than temporary disturbances, while those which are large and deep cut are menaces to life. 

Islands found in the Heart line under the Mounts will generally add a heart complication to some health defect of that Mount type. 

When seen always locate the type of the subject and hunt for a health defect peculiar to him, which if found must have heart weakness added. In this way you are often warned by an island on the Heart line and find back of it additional trouble. 

If chance lines from any other part of the hand run to or near an island on the Heart line, they will give the clue by the place from which they start as to where you should look for information which you can bring to bear on the island.

If split lines rise or fall from the Heart line at or near an island these will tell, by the place they end, something about the outcome of the island. 

When an island is seen, search must be made to ascertain whether it is a health defect, and generally this will be the case. If not, look to location, chance, and other lines for information bearing on some disappointment to the affections. 

An island on the Heart line under Apollo is always a health indication. This will be completely confirmed from nails, etc.

Dots on the Heart line (57) are generally health defects. Their seriousness is gauged by their size. 

When seen, always examine for heart disease. 

If no indication is seen anywhere else, and the dot is small, the case is not serious. The more pronounced the signs of heart trouble which are seen elsewhere, and the larger the dot, the more serious the difficulty.
