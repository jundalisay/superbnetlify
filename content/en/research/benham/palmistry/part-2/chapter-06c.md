Sometimes the line of Head rises inside the line of Life on the lower Mount of Mars, and, after crossing the Life line, winds its way across the hand (94). 

This subject is extremely vacillating. 

He starts many things with enthusiasm and before he dies will have made innumerable changes. 

He is a shifter who constantly alters his opinions and does not continue in the same way of thinking long at a time. He is always intense in his views, makes most violent resolutions, and changes his mind with facility, but always with the same vigor. 

These subjects are rarely successful, for they do not stick to anything long enough to win. 

They are always aggressive, for the Head line rises from lower Mars, consequently they are frequently in trouble, always picking quarrels, and are avoided by those who do not want contention. The shifting mind and quarrelsome disposition are a poor combination, for one can never tell what tack these people may take next.

If the color of the hand and lines be red, this will add to the unpleasantness of the indication, if yellow, the subject will be intolerably mean, in addition. The less mentality the hand indicates, the less will the subject be able to overcome the trouble, but good first phalanges to the fingers, a long second phalanx of thumb, with a long, narrow, or paddle-shaped first phalanx of that member, will give the subject forces with which he can largely counteract the shifting disposition indicated by such a Head line. Sometimes the Head line rises from the Mount of Jupiter (95).

This line shows fine capability for leadership, a person who can handle men with ease and get the most out of them, one who is self-confident; and this source of the Head line is always an indication of strong mentality. There is diplomacy present which enables the subject to dictate without being harsh, to rule when he seems to be ruled, to appear dependent when he knows all depends on him; he is brainy, brilliant, and successful. 

Always note his type; if of a coarse make-up, the tact and diplomacy will disappear; he will lead but men will feel his strength. 

If the hand be fine, he will accomplish all he wishes, and men will not know how he does it. Sometimes the line will rise just at the base of the Mount of Jupiter (96), sometimes it will sweep clear up to the base of the finger, as in No. 95. Between these two sources are many degrees, and your estimate of the strength of the indication must be in proportion to its degree of marking on the Mount. Sometimes the line rises from the Life line but a branch rises to the Mount of Jupiter (97). This shows that ambition and the desire to be great or famous rule the subject. If the hand be purely a mental one, the subject's ambitions will be for mental fame. 

If the hand be purely artistic, his ambitions will be for fame in that direction. If the hand be purely material, his ambition will be for riches. 

He will always strive to rise, and the life generally follows an upward grade.

The course of the line through the hand is next to be considered. In cutting its way across the hand, the straighter the line runs (98), and the less it is changed in its course, the more fixed are the ideas of the subject, the more evenly is he balanced mentally, and the more practical and common-sense are his views. This line shows that he pursues an even course, and that outside influences have very little effect on him. He gauges everything by a practical standard and accepts what he chooses, allowing the balance to pass by without making much impression on him. 

The tendency or danger indicated by this line is that of becoming too unimpressionable, too inelastic, too sordid, to allow of adaptability. These subjects often do not make many friends, as they want everyone to come to their way of thinking. 

Everything is subjected to plain common-sense, often narrow views, and anything speculative or ideal is an abomination. This straight line must be the gauge by which you judge all deflections. When the line of Head rises on or under Jupiter, we have the qualities of that Mount exerting strong influence on the subject, and it is seldom that a line will be so placed that it can be deflected upward toward the Mount of Jupiter, but we do find the line deflected under the other Mounts. The line of Head normally curves upward slightly in the beginning of its course, and in most hands this curve is about midway between Jupiter and Saturn.

When the line so perceptibly curves under Saturn (99) that its course is greatly changed, it shows that the subject is strongly tinged with Saturnian ideas. Often when every other method of classifying your subject into his proper type has failed, the Head line deflected toward a Mount will do it for you. The greater the deflection of the line toward Saturn the more surely will Saturnian ideas be strong in the subject. 


You must note the character of the hand with this marking; if the mental world rules, then your client will love the study and research for which the Saturnian is famous; if the middle world rules, he will love farming, mining, and horticulture; if the lower world rules, his ideas will run toward the saving of money. If the line is deflected toward Apollo (100), the subject's mind will run in Apollonian channels.

If the upper world rules, it will be art, pure and simple; if the middle world is stronger, money-making and love of beauty will be combined; if the lower world dominates, love of display, and a coarser love of the artistic will be indicated. The larger the deflection the greater is the degree of influence exerted by Apollo, and this is true of all deflections. When the line is deflected toward Mercury (101) it shows that Mercurian ideas are strong. 

If the upper world rules, fine powers of expression, persuasive force, even oratorical power, are indicated. The kind will be shown by the shape of the finger-tips. 

If the middle world is strongest, the mind will lean toward scientific investigations and the subject will be a good physician, teacher, or lawyer. If the lower world rules, money-making talent is strongly indicated. With a deflection toward this Mount, watch the crooking and twisting of the finger, to determine how much added shrewdness is present, and how near the subject is to roguery. If the line is wavy from source to termination (102) it will show that the subject has had no permanent fixedness of ideas. 

The variations which may occur in this wavy line are infinite, but by following the line from its beginning you can tell the age when each mental variation occurs and in what direction it tends. This reading of the line by sections will give the mental changes in detail. 


The general interpretation which must be applied to a wavy line is a lack of continuous mental effort in any one direction, changeability of purpose, and consequent vacillation. Such a Head line is never self-reliant. As counsellors and advisers these people are not safe, for their opinions are not long the same. It is an unstable line, and shows unstable ideas.

 The line is often seen deflecting upward in a curve which may take it close to the line of Heart (103). This will show that the heart is a stronger factor than the head, and that sentiment will largely influence the subject. If the deflection of the Head toward the Heart line begins early in the line, and continues to the end, it will show that the heart was always the strongest, even from the beginning of life. If the deflection occurs later, this condition began later. 

If the deflection is slight, the heart will influence but not entirely rule the subject; if it is very great the heart will largely dictate. It is necessary with this indication to note which line is the deeper and stronger. If the Heart line, then sentiment will guide and reason will give way. If the Head, then reason will assert itself, often producing mental distress because the dictates of the heart cannot be followed. 


Sometimes the line is found deflecting downward (104). The straight Head line marks the medium or nearest normal condition, and, generally speaking, all rising deflections come from an uplifting force, and conversely all downward deflections come from a downward influence. 

Consequently when the line of Head is seen to deflect downward, we feel that the mental attitude of the subject has been lowered during the period covered by this deflection. As the straight Head line shows the operation of a practical mentality, the downward deflection shows that a departure from the practical lines of thought occurs during the deflection, at what age can be read on the line.
