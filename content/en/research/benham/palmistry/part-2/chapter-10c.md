All defects in the Saturn line are important, for they show:
- how many and what kind of impediments will occur in the subject's life
- how serious they will be

The cause producing most of these <!-- checks --> defects can be located in various parts of the hand. It is possible to remedy or avoid a good many of them. 

All defects found in the beginning of the Saturn line refer to the childhood of the subject, and daring this period the child is too young to do much by himself, either toward improving or hindering his condition. 

Consequently, all defects or impediments to childhood are either the result of ill-health, or come from paternal influences, both of which are beyond the power of the child to control. 

The death of parents, their financial difficulty occurring at this time, or estrangements which may occur between the parents, are all possibilities and are all causes, which will check the prosperous career of a child, whose start in life may thus be impeded by these conditions. 

So, when we see a Saturn line defective at the start, but growing deep and well cut (358), we know that, whatever the cause of the trouble at the beginning, it has been overcome. 

Such a line shows either that the improved condition arises from the removal of the causes which were operating against the subject, or that he has himself risen superior to the obstacles. 

It makes no difference as to the character of the defect which appears in the beginning of a Saturn line, the general rule is the same. It indicates an impediment to the early years of the subject. 

If a short Influence line on the Mount of Venus end in a star, and the Saturn line be chained at the beginning, the death of a parent has clouded the early career of the subject (359). The age at which this parent died can be read from the distance the star reaches on the Life line. 

The date at which the improvement in the affairs of the subject occurred can be read from the line of Saturn. If a short line of Influence end in a star and a Worry line run from it and cut a rising branch on the Life line ending in an island on the line of Head (360), the death of a parent has brought on a check to the upward course of the subject's life which has affected his mental strength, and thus checked and retarded his career.

Islands in the Saturn line (361) have very generally received the interpretation of a check to the career, arising from the marital infidelity or moral depravity of the subject. It was recognized by older palmists that islands always indicated trouble, and as the above reading of immorality originated in lands where virtue among women was rarer than in this country, it was seen on the hands of many women who had bad reputations and ruined and checkered careers. 

These women being known to be profligate, this interpretation of immorality was given the island in the line of Saturn. This indication has caused much discussion among palmists, and much confusion and error among practitioners. 

After careful study of the subject, I can say that an island in the Saturn line indicates a period of financial difficulty, lasting the length of the island, and that the marking is not per se an indication of infidelity. 

This conclusion has been reached after the examination of hundreds of hands having such a marking, in which financial trouble or losses have been completely verified, and in which only a few cases of infidelity were found accompanying it. In these latter cases I am sure that the infidelity caused the financial trouble. 

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 4 512 No. 361.  -->

An island, if found at the beginning of the Saturn line, could not indicate infidelity of the subject, for he is then too young to make such a thing possible. Financial difficulty might be present in his life through a difficulty of bis parents. If such be the case, Worry lines will often be seen running from Influence lines on the Mount of Venus, to the island in Saturn line (362). 

If tie Life line be defective at the beginning, either broad and shallow, chained, islanded, split or broken, and if this continue past the period covered by the delicacy of childhood usually seen in this line, and if an island be also seen in the beginning of the Saturn line, the prolonged delicacy of the subject's health will cause difficulty in early life, and will last until the Saturn line grows better (363). 

If the Head line be defective early in its course, with an island at the beginning of the line of Saturn (364), poor mentality will be the impediment which is Causing the check to the career of the subject. 

In these cases of ill health the Life line and other parts of the hand will be weak in sympathy. If a short Influence line on the Mount of Venus end with a star, with an island in the line of Saturn at its beginning, the death of a parent will cause financial difficulty during early life (365). This indication is intensified if Worry lines run to the island from this star.

If Worry lines run from Influence lines on Mount of Venus to an island at the beginning of the Saturn line, constant annoyances in the early life of the subject bring about a check to his career (366). This shows quite plainly, for these Worry lines cut the Life line and point to the effect they produce by the island on the Saturn line. With all islands at the beginning of the Saturn line, there is an explanation somewhere in the hand as to the cause which produces them. There is no element of chance in this indication other than health or heredity, and the cause can be found if you apply diligence and good reasoning. 

When an island in this location is seen, go over every line in the hand and hunt for defects. Go over the Influence lines on Mount of Venus to discover what part relatives may play ; look to the Mounts for health defects of all the types, and for chance lines pointing from these defects to the island. In this way the cause of trouble can be found.

Cross-bars cutting the Saturn line (367) are obstructions to the career of the subject. Each one of the bars is a separate obstruction, and by noting the depth of each you can tell how serious it is. If only faint lines which do not cut through the Saturn line but pass over it, they indicate continual annoying interferences and impediments. 

If they cut the line in two, they are serious checks which threaten to destroy the success of the subject. The age at which each of these interferences occurs can be read from the Saturn line, their seriousness by the depth of the cutting line, their cause from other lines and signs, and their outcome by the termination of the Saturn line. 

Breaks in the line (368) are most serious. At the time they occur some force has been sufficiently strong to check the career entirely, and if the line takes a new character, starts in a new direction, or does not start at all, these breaks indicate an entire change in the course of a subject's life-work. If the Saturn line be repeatedly broken it indicates a continual number of reverses, and the subject will have a laborious and troubled life. Each break indicates a different misfortune, and is more or less serious as the break is wide or is repaired. 

The age of each break can be read from the Saturn line. If the line be broken in many places but is repaired (369), the subject after numerous disappointments will fight his way eventually to success. It will be a continual fight, however, and such a subject will require great will power to carry him along. With breaks in the Saturn line both hands should always be examined, for from them you will read whether all of the impediments in the line are a part of the natural plan or are the result of acquired habits, mistakes of calculation, ill health, or other causes. 

In a large majority of cases, the Saturn line is much better in the left than in the right hand.
- It shows that many of our trials are brought on by ourselves. 

If a line of Saturn be uneven (370), alternately deep and thin in character, the subject will have intermittent periods of prosperity.
- It indicates an unreliable and varying state of affairs. 
- He must use continual watchfulness in order so that what he gained will not be lost during the periods of the thinness of the line


If the line of Saturn is wavy (371), the subject will follow a constantly changing course.

- If, in addition to its wavy course, this line be uneven or defective in other ways, the subject will have increased difficulty in his journey through life. 

If a line of Saturn begins deep at the base, and runs to the line of Head and there stops (372), the career of the subject will be favorable up to 30, when errors of judgment will interfere. 
- From that time he will have a harder time to get along; 
- He must rely entirely upon effort, not chance, and do the best he can to force his way. 
- His period of greatest production has passed. 

After the age at which a line of Saturn stops, the subject will have to exert great effort in order to accomplish much, as it is during the life of the line that he must achieve the greater part of his results.

Many Saturn lines will be seen which have little fine lines rising from them, or falling in a downward direction (373). Rising lines will indicate the upward tendency of the life, and will add strength to the line on which they are seen. During whatever portion of the line these branches appear, that part of the line will be filled with hope and ambition and will be more successful than any other period. 

During the time when downward branches are seen, the life will be harder, more filled with discouragements, and progress will be difficult. The appearance of these upward and downward branches I have found to follow the health of the subject closely. 

When upward branches are seen, the physical powers will be found good. With downward branches on the Saturn line and an island in the Life line, the unfavorable condition of the Saturn line is to be accounted for by delicacy of health (374). If downward branches be seen, with an island in the Head line or Heart line at the same age, the difficulty will be brain or heart disease, according to which line shows the marking (375). If rheumatic indications be seen on Saturn and Middle Mount of Moon and downward branches are on the Saturn line, the difficulty will be rheumatism, or maybe gout (376). The Life line will generally be defective during the same period. 

In every case the difficulty during the period indicated by these downward branches can be accounted for by defects seen in some other part of the hand. 

The downward branches are the warning to look for trouble, and the task of the palmist must be to find out what will cause it. Upward branches on the Saturn line, being favorable, do not need this care, for during favorable times people get along well enough; it is the periods of trouble that need to be guarded against. 

There is one marking of the upward branches, however, which is useful. With upward branches from the Saturn line, if Worry lines from Mount of Venus cut the Life line and in turn cut these upward branches, the course of the subject, which is upward, will be constantly interfered with (377). 

While these interferences may not be able to destroy the effect of his favorable period, they will materially hamper and annoy him. In many hands Worry lines from the Mount of Venus, lines from the Mount of Moon, and chance lines from all parts of the hand will be found crossing and joining themselves to the line of Saturn (378). This is particularly the case with nervous persona, who have much lined and rayed hands. 

Each one of these events, persons, illnesses, or whatever may be the interpretation of the several lines, will in some way affect the career of the subject. Some of these will be a positive detriment, others will strengthen and aid in the advancement of the subject.

As a general proposition, all lines which cut the Saturn line weaken it, and impede the progress of the subject at the age indicated by the cut (379).

And all lines which merge into or run alongside the line strengthen it. These lines will rise from all parts of the hand, and will represent different factors which are a detriment and a check to the subject's progress, or which aid him. In all cases, the place from which these lines start will give you the clew to the influence. If a chance line from a star on Mount of Jupiter cuts the Saturn line, the subject will suffer a severe check from too much ambition. 

His endeavor to know distinguished people will lead him to do foolish things which injure his prospects (380). If this chance line runs to an island in the Saturn line, his ambition to move in the front rank will cause him to be extravagant, and financial difficulties will result (381). 

If with a bad Mercurian hand, grilled Mount, twisted finger, and large third phalanx of Mercury, a chance line from the Mount of Mercury cut the Saturn line, the dishonesty of the subject will bring him to grief (382). In these cases the type of your subject will aid you greatly, and the end of the Saturn line will give you the outcome of the cutting. If a line of Saturn be cut by a line running from an Influence line on Mount of Venus, and the Saturn line be broken for the rest of its course, an influence will cause a serious disaster (383). 

If you correctly judge the Influence line from which this cutting line starts to be the wife or husband, and if from it a chance line run to Mount of Jupiter, the ambitions of the wife or husband have led the subject to extravagances which he could not afford, and if the Saturn line be defective for the balance of its course, he will never recover from the reverses (384). 

If the Saturn line be cut by Worry lines from the Life line which is defective, ill health will be a bar to the prospects of the subject, and if the Saturn line be defective after the cut, the subject will never be able to get over it (385). 

The combinations of these cutting chance lines are infinite ; in some hands several will be seen, each one of which indicates a check from a different source. In these cases every cutting line is an object of special inquiry.

Many chance lines run toward the Saturn line but do not touch it (386). These lines are events or influences, according to their source, but are abortive attempts to influence the career, and, while they exist as possible menaces, for the lines may grow until they cut the Saturn line, they are not immediate dangers. Some chance lines merge into the Saturn line (387). These lines represent events or influences which have come into and become a part of the life of the subject, but as they do not cut the line the career is not checked. 

If the Saturn line be thin or defective in any no. 386. way, and these influencing lines are deep and strong, they will add to the prosperity of the subject and assist to overcome his difficulties. 

If, in the beginning, a Saturn line be chained or otherwise defective, and a chance line merges into it, after which it becomes deep, the influence which has come into the life has improved the subject's condition. If this chance line comes from the Mount of Moon it will be some outside influence (388), if it comes from Mount of Venus it will be the influence of close relatives (389). 


At whatever point these chance lines merge into the Saturn line, the good effect of the influence will be exerted at the age indicated, and the subsequent condition of the Saturn line will show how much strength the influence has given. If a Saturn line, defec tive at the start, has a chance line merging into it, and if the Saturn line becomes only thin afterwards, or not guile so defective, the influence has not been very beneficial. 

If the Saturn line becomes deep, the benefit has been great. Other chance lines which do not touch the Saturn line, but run alongside of it (390), are lines exerting a strong influence on the subject's career, for by helping and supporting they act as sister lines. By the place from which these lines start you can judge what they are, and by the effect they have on the Saturn line you can tell how much good they do. 

If a Saturn line is broken, and a chance line from the Head line run alongside of it, the subject's good judgment will come to his relief and will carry him over his difficulty (391). 

In all cases where defects in the line are seen, look first for their cause and then to the repair indications. If a defective Saturn line have a chance line from a smooth and good Upper Mars running by its side, the resistance of the Mount will not permit discouragements to overthrow the subject, and this determination will save him from trouble (392).
