The color of the Head line must always be noted. 

White color will show poor blood supply to the brain and consequent weak operation of that organ. This color is most often seen on the broad and shallow or chained lines, and it adds to the poor indication of these lines, making them weaker. Pink color gives better force and takes away some of the weakness. 

Red color makes them more intense and less liable to absolute weakness ; but red color will make broad and shallow and chained lines violent and spasmodic in their action. 

Thus, for periods they show great force, but the effort is only temporary and has no lasting quality. 

These subjects often deceive even close observers by displays of mental vigor, but they do not deceive those who are familiar with the cause. Yellow color in a broad and shallow or chained line will make the subject, in addition to the weak mental operation, cross, nervous, despondent, and fault-finding. 

The meanness of disposition which yellow color also gives is present if the line is pronouncedly yellow, and with this combination you have a weak and mean head combined. 

Blue color shows congested circulation in the brain, and while it is per se a heart indication, it shows that the mentality may be cut off at any moment by a sudden heart failure. 

In deep and well cut lines, white color is not often seen, but when the line on pressure does not show the red blood flowing along it, but remains white, it is an indication of coldness which must be added to the strong operation of the good line. The owner of this brain is calculating, cold, avaricious, and seeks self-aggrandizement at the expense of others. 

As this deep line shows great determination and strength of mind, the white coldness also seen in it indicates one who has little sympathy or feeling for others, and such a subject easily becomes the master and the tyrant, whether in home or business. The deep white line shows the strong, cold head. 

Pink color is often seen in all kinds of lines and gives its added strength to the deep line. The subject with this combination has a vigorous, healthy brain and a strong mentality. His danger is from overwork. Red color often means excess with a deep Head line, and it results in mentally unbalancing the subject. 

Too much brain and too much blood in it are the indications of this combination, and apoplexy, fainting fits, and insanity follow. Always regard red color in a deep Head line as a menace, and look over all the band for the place it will make its danger felt. 

Yellow color adds its baleful qualities to the deep line and makes the subject strong of brain but mean. This will produce the really vicious subject who conspires against his fellow-men. With a thin line, white color makes it weaker than if it were pink, while red color adds much strength. 

With the latter color the danger is that more force will be exerted than the thin line can stand and the subject will overstrain his brain. Yellow color in a thin line makes the subject narrow, little, mean, nervous, and unstable. On the Head line we encounter all the defects possible to lines, and have frequent calls made upon us to read these defects correctly. 


## Defects of the Head Line

The defects commonly seen on Head lines are:
- uneven lines
- splits
- cross-bars
- islands
- dots
- breaks. 

<!-- constitute  or, as commonly known, single signs, which -->
These are specific defects common to broad and shallow or chained lines, but are not often encountered on deep or even thin lines. 

These specific defects in the Head line show that:
- the operation of the mental activity is not continuous, regular, and strong. These defects have intervened, obstructing the flow of the Current and the operation of the brain
- periods of health occur, followed by periods of weakness or disease, and consequently that the mental powers have at times been interfered with. 

How great these interferences are, or have been, may be judged by the size and importance of the defect. 

When they begin and how long they last may be judged by the duration of the defective condition of the line. The first defective condition which we will consider is the uneven line. 

This is a line which is thin for awhile, then thick, then thin again, and following a like variation throughout its course (147). These alterations may occur frequently, or only once or twice in the whole line. 

They show that the mentality of the subject changes, now weak for a period of years, then strong, then weak, then strong, as many changes being indicated as there are uneven places on the line. 

At the time the deep lines occur there is no doubt that great concentration of thought takes place, and the pressure on the brain is very strong. If the Head line at the beginning be thin, class it as a thin line and the deep places are the periods when great pressures occur. This is a dangerous line, for at these deep places the thin line may be crowded too much. 

These subjects alternate between enthusiasm and despair, are changeable, and not reliable counsellors or guides. If a star, cross, or dot occurs in the course of this uneven line, paralysis, apoplexy, or insanity will be indicated. The greatest care, plenty of sleep, and no excitement must be the advice given this subject. 

On the Head line will be seen splits of an infinite variety of sizes, and running in many directions. As a general rule splits which rise from the line are better indications than those which fall from it. 


<!-- The Line Of Head Part 10 304 No. 147. The Line Of Head. Part 11  -->

If these rising splits are small and frequent but not large enough to impair the line (148) they show that the subject is aspiring to rise and to improve and that he seeks all avenues for advancement, as is indicated by these splits rising under all the Mounts. 

If these splits are large and long (149) they indicate that the head is influenced by too many things, making the subject vacillating. 

Such a subject will never have the concentration of mind that a deep and well cut line gives. The thoughts wander too much, and if the Head line droops toward the Mount of the Moon, these subjects are day dreamers. If the splits drop below the line (150) it shows that the subject is easily discouraged, does not fight the battle of life with vigor, but is prone to say, "lam unlucky." 

Such subjects start into every enterprise saying they know " it will fail," and as they really believe this, it generally does. Older palmists read this indication as " sorrows and disappointments," which is generally correct, for the reasons above stated. 

Always give these subjects advice along the line of " resisting more and not giving way so easily." A angle split rising under Jupiter (151) shows that ambitious thoughts 611 the mind of your subject, and that Jupiterian desires are his. The Line Of Head Part 11 305 No. 148. He wishes to rise and to achieve fame and notoriety. This is a mark of great ambition and pride if found with a large Mount of Jupiter. If a split rises under Saturu (152) it shows that the thoughts are Saturnian, and wisdom, soberness, studiousness, and other Saturnian attributes attract your subject. 

These splits show the pulling force of some attraction which is not strong enough to deflect the entire line, but is powerful enough to split a part from it; thus they show the attracting force of the place to which the split goes. If in either of the above cases the split line should end in a star (153) it will show that success rewards these ambitions or desires. The same construction applies to all the other Mounts. 

In these cases be certain that the line is a split from the line of Head and not a chance line cutting it as 154. By closely examining the point where the split leaves the Main line you can easily diagnose the indication as a split. 

If a split line rises from the line of Head and runs to Apollo (155) it shows that He will also be more sympathetic and humane. If split lines rise from the line of Head and merge into the line of Heart the head has been powerfully guided by heart. Often these lines are seen cutting the line of Saturu (159); in this case sentiment has interfered with business success.

Cross-bars are lines which cut the Head line, sometimes only one being seen, and again the entire line is cut by them (160). They are short lines which have no particular beginning or ending, but are apparently just long enough to cut the line of Head. 

They cannot be classed as chance lines, but must be distinguished as cross-bars. If these lines are deep, cutting the Head line sharply, and are also red, they indicate a brain disorder, may be fever, may be only headaches, the severity of the attack being proportionate to their depth and redness. 

The age can be read from the line. If several of these deep bars cut the Head line there is predisposition to brain trouble, and with a Jupiterian subject this is a serious matter, for apoplexy may result. If these cross-bars are merely little fine lines which cross the Head line they show mental worries and predisposition to severe headaches, but do not go so far as brain fever. 

They are generally seen on the hands of hyper-nervous persons. Islands on the line (161) show that at the time they occur the mental strength operates with diminished force. I have seen islands on the Head lines of many insane persons whose aberration lasted through the duration of the island. 

I have seen them on the Head lines of those whose line of thought had been changed, and who confessed that during the period indicated by the island they felt that they were not mentally balanced. I have seen the islands at points on lines where brain fever has occurred, or where delirium has been produced by other fevers. 

I have seen them also on the hands of many spirit mediums who said they were "developed" into mediums at the age when the island appeared. I have seen them on the hands of women who have suffered from female trouble until their reason has been affected. Many similar instances might be cited, all of which would lead to the statement that during the period covered by an island, the mind is not in full health and power, and that an island shows delicacy of the brain during the period covered by it, more or less pronounced according to the size of the defect. Islands have been much used as denoting herditary weakness or defects ; they sometimes do, but they are not per se an indicator of heredity. 

They always show a defect in constitution during their presence, and if any undue excitement or mental strain is put on the subject during the period of life covered by an island on the Head line, his mind will undoubtedly be unbalanced. Islands on the Head line in 85%, of cases indicate that the mind will be disturbed during their presence. 

If islands are deep cut and red, the trouble will be brain fever, or possibly it may be female trouble, delirium of typhoid or other fevers, hyper-nervousness, or severe mental strain, sometimes the embracing of a new religion, that will produce the loss of mental equilibrium. 

In hands full of lines crossing in every direction it is safe to read islands as periods of mental unbalance. The subject who has hands free from lines - which shows him to be phlegmatic and without nervous strain - may avoid the danger by his naturally calm, even temper. 

These islands on the Head line shows grave danger.

You can estimate the results by the character of the Head line before and after the island. 

If after it a star, a cross, a dot, or a severe break in the line be seen the subject will not avoid serious mental disorder. If the line be deep and well cut after an island the results are not likely to be so serious. Always note the color of an island in the Head line, and apply color qualities. Deep red is always an added danger to the indication.

This will show that the brain was forced too much, and this produced the mental disturbance shown by the island. Note chance lines which connect the island with some other part of the hand; these will often show that diseases peculiar to the Mount types have caused the island. 

These chance lines are very trustworthy if they run from grilles or crossbars on the Mounts to an island on the Head line. An island on the Head line under Saturn is seen in the hands of 90% of deaf mutes.

Dots in the Head line (163) are acute brain disorders which are severe according to the size and color of the dot. 

If small and white or pink the trouble is an illness, but not per se of grave import. If the dot be large and deep red or purple, the brain trouble indicated is severe and great care should be taken by the subject at the age it occurs. The character of the line following dots will tell the effect which the illness has on the head. If the line continues deep and well cut the effect is only temporary. 

If the line grows thin (164) it shows that mental vigor has decreased. If the dot be followed by a chained line (165) it shows that the brain sickness has much impaired the mind, and unless the chain is very short and replaced by a deep line (166) the mind will never entirely recover from the injury. 

During the period covered by the dot and chain there will be some mental disturbance, and no attempt should be made to pursue usual vocations. White dots almost always tell of past brain illness, and when the dots are deep red or purple they will generally be found in advance of the present age of the subject. 

Islands following a dot (167) show great delicacy of brain following a severe illness - the longer and larger the island the greater the delicacy and the longer its duration. 

This is a grave indication. The subject will be greatly unbalanced after the illness. 

A star or cross following a dot (168) will show the fatal termination of the illness which is indicated by the dot. This is read with as much certainty as if shown on the Life line. 

An island following a dot and ending in a star (169) will show that a severe brain illness occurs at the age when the dot appears on the line, followed by a period of delicacy lasting as long as the island, and ending fatally at the age at which the star appears. 

If the Head line runs on after the star (170) it will show insanity instead of the termination of life. Breaks in the line (171) show the interruption of the Current, its unsteady flow, producing irregular action and consequent lack of concentration, firmness, and self-control. 

These breaks may be illnesses ; if so they will be corroborated by nails, Life line, and other indications of disease. They are often seen on the hands of flighty, nervous, changeable subjects, and there is illness present at each time the line breaks. The age at which all of these illnesses occur can be read from the line. 

If the line is continually broken and ladder-like (172) it shows an utter lack of stability; the subject is fickle and shifting, has continuous headaches, poor health, visions, phantasms, and unless cared for by no. 168. someone else goes insane or borders on it from nervousness. 

These subjects fly off on tangents, are always seeking for the unrealizable, and if pointed tips are present they are utterly unpractical and unreliable, especially if the Head line goes far into the Mount of Moon. With every break in the Head line note whether it is repaired by sister lines, by the overlapping ends, connecting bars, squares, or any other repair signs. 



If so, the subject will have a mental jar at the time of the break which will be more or less severe according to the size of the break and to how well it is repaired. 

If the end of the broken line turns toward any Mount, handle it as in the case of the split running to a Mount. 

Wherever the broken end goes it will show the force which produced the break. Note the condition of the line after a break, and it will tell whether the break has permanently impaired the mental stamina, or whether it is overcome. Note all signs like stars, dots, crosses, or islands after a break, and they will tell of the result on the mental capacity of the subject. 

By following the line from source to termination and noting every change that occurs you will have no trouble in handling any break encountered. 

Stars found on the Head line (173) are always a danger. 

The electric light on the Head line does not produce brilliancy, but explosion. This may mean a sudden collapse, apoplexy, or insanity. Study the type of your subject; if Jupiterian or Martian interpret the star as apoplexy ; if Sa-turnian or Lunarian, read it as paralysis or insanity. 

Follow all the instructions given in diagnosing disease, and you will never be at a loss. Watch for chance lines to the star, which will help to tell the cause of it. In every case consider a star on the Head line a danger and seek its explanation. Crosses on the Head line are also dangerous, and if large and deep are nearly as much so as a star. They must be estimated in the same manner as stars.
