## Classification

Classifying the subject's type is the first step. 

<!-- In the above examinations you will be much assisted by having first classified your subject into his proper type. --> 


The following is the order of those ruled by the head:
1. Saturnian
2. Lunarian
3.  Mercurian
4. Jupiterian
5. Martian

The following is the order of those ruled by the heart:
1. Apollonian
2. Venusian

<!--  incline to have heart lead them. With the above markings base the strength of your statements of the indications upon the type as well as the indications of the line itself, and you will arrive at absolute accuracy. --> 


## Line Length

The length of the line is the next step. 

<!--  should next be noted, for it will tell of much or little heart.  -->

If the line rises normally but runs only a short distance and stops (32), it indicates that the subject will have serious difficulty at the time at which it ends, even if all the other lines go on to their normal length. This abrupt termination of the Heart line means either that the heart will stop beating, or else that the subject has little heart or affection for others. 

<!-- You can judge which by the directions given later in this chapter. It is, in either case, a poor sign.  -->

If the Heart line crosses the entire hand (33) it shows that the subject has too much heart and will allow sentiment to guide him in everything. 

<!-- The Line Of Heart Part 2 189 No. 32. The Line Of Heart Part 2 190 No. 33. The Line Of Heart.  -->

In business, he will not choose employees because they are best fitted to do his work, but because they "need a job". <!-- and in all the walks of life he will be guided by sentiment. --> He will become easily jealous, and will love much and suffer if he does not get much in return. 

The older palmists read a line rising well up into the finger of Jupiter and running clear across the hand "failure in all enterprises." 

This reading was probably based on the fact that one who is in everything ruled by sentiment can seldom cope successfully with cold schemers. You can see that such a subject will not necessarily "fail in all enterprises' though he is not likely to get along so well as one more practical in matters of heart. So our reading, "too much heart," is the best.
