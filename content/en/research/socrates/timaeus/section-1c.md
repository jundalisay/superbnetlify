## Time

The Creator he rejoiced at the creature which he had made. He determined to make the copy still more like the original.

This was eternal. He sought to make the universe eternal as much as He could. 

The nature of the existing Idea was everlasting. But it was impossible to bestow immortality on a creature. 

**So He resolved to have a moving image of eternity.** 

When He organized the heavens, He made this image eternal but moving according to number, while eternity itself rests in unity*.



> *Superphysics Note= This is the metaphysical time, as opposed to physical time


This image we call time.

There were no days, nights, months, and years before heaven was created. After heaven was constructed, they was created also.

They are all parts of time. The past and future are created species of time, which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the idea of infinity. <!-- eternal essence -->

We say that a thing "was," "is," and "will be." 

But the truth is that a thing only has "is". "Was" and "will be" only refer to becoming in time. Past and future are motions. 

A thing that is immovably the same cannot become older or younger by time.
- It cannot "did" or "has become", or "will be"
- It cannot be "older" or "younger"
- It cannot be subject at all to any of those states which affect moving and sensible things and of which generation is the cause.

These are the forms of time, which imitates eternity and revolves according to a law of number.

All the following are inaccurate modes of expression:
- What has become is become
- What becomes is becoming
- What will become is about to become
- The non-existent is non-existent

Time and the heaven came into being at the same instant.    
- If one was dissolved, the other would be dissolved too.
- It was framed after the pattern of the eternal nature, that it might resemble this as far as was possible.
- For the pattern exists from eternity.
- The created heaven has been, and is, and will be, in all time.
- Such was the mind and thought of God in the creation of time.

The sun, moon, and five planets were created by Him to distinguish and preserve the numbers of time.
- When he had made those planets, he placed them in the orbits in which the circle of the other was revolving -- in seven orbits seven stars. 

First, there was the moon in the orbit nearest the earth.
- Next was the sun, in the second orbit above the earth
- Then came venus and the star sacred to Hermes, moving in orbits which have an equal swiftness with the sun, but in an opposite direction.
- This is why the sun and Hermes and Lucifer overtake and are overtaken by each other.

To enumerate the places which he assigned to the other stars, and to give all the reasons why he assigned them, although a secondary matter, would give more trouble than the primary. 
<!-- - These things at some future time, when we are at leisure, may have the consideration which they deserve, but not at present. -->


## Gravitation and Relativity

The stars were thus necessary for the creation of time. After they attained a motion suitable to them, they became living creatures having bodies fastened by vital chains of gravity.

They learned their appointed task, moving in the motion of Yin, which is diagonal, and passes through and is governed by the motion of Yang. 

They revolved, some in a larger and some in a lesser orbit -- those which had the lesser orbit revolving faster, and those which had the larger more slowly. 

- Because of the motion of Yang, those which revolved fastest appeared to be overtaken by those which moved slower although they really overtook them.
- This is because the motion of Yang made them all turn in a spiral and, because some went one way and some another.

Those which receded most slowly from the sphere of the same, which was the swiftest, appeared to follow it most nearly. 

- That there might be some visible measure of their relative swiftness and slowness as they proceeded in their eight courses, 

God made the sun in the second orbit from the earth to:
- give light to the whole of heaven, and
- for the animals to participate in number and learn arithmetic from the revolution of the same and the like. 

This led to night and the day as the period of the one most intelligent revolution.
- The month is accomplished when the moon has completed her orbit and overtaken the sun.
- The year when the sun has completed his own orbit.

Mankind, with hardly an exception, have not remarked the periods of the other stars, and they have no name for them, and do not measure them against one another by the help of number, and hence they can scarcely be said to know that their wanderings, being infinite in number and admirable for their variety, make up time. 

Yet there is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of time fulfils the perfect year when all the eight revolutions, having their relative degrees of swiftness, are accomplished together and attain their completion at the same time, measured by the rotation of the same and equally moving. 

After this manner, and for these reasons, came into being such of the stars as in their heavenly progress received reversals of motion, to the end that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature, and be as like as possible to the perfect and intelligible animal.
