## The Universe

Our first question is: why did the Creator make the world? He made this world of generation because He was good, and the good can never be jealous of anything.

Being free from jealousy, he desired that all things should be as like Himself. According to wise men, this is in the truest sense the origin of creation and of the world= 

- God desired that all things be good and nothing bad. 
- Wherefore also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving in an irregular and disorderly fashion, out of disorder he brought order, considering that this was in every way better than the other.
- The creator found that no unintelligent creature taken as a whole was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole; and that intelligence could not be present in anything which was devoid of soul.
- This is why he put intelligence in soul, and soul in body, that he might be the creator of a work which was by nature fairest and best.
- Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of God.


Our second question is: In the likeness of what animal did the Creator make the world?

- It would be an unworthy thing to liken it to any nature which exists as a part only; for nothing can be beautiful which is like any imperfect thing.
- But let us suppose the world to be the very image of that whole of which all other animals both individually and in their tribes are portions.
- For the original of the universe contains in itself all intelligible beings, just as this world comprehends us and all other visible creatures.
- For the Deity, intending to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of intelligible beings, framed one visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals of a kindred nature.


Our third question is: Is there only one world, or are there many and infinite?

- There must be one only, if the created copy is to accord with the original. For that which includes all other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or companion; in that case there would be need of another living being which would include both, and of which they would be parts, and the likeness would be more truly said to resemble not them, but that other which included them. 
- In order then that the world might be solitary, like the perfect animal, the creator made not two worlds or an infinite number of them; but there is and ever will be one only -- begotten and created heaven.


A corporeal thing is also visible and tangible. 

- Visibility requires light
- Tangibility requires solidity
- Solidity requires earth

Thus, God in the beginning of creation made the body of the universe to consist of fire and earth.
- But two things cannot be rightly put together without a third to act as a bond of union between them. 
- The fairest bond is that which makes the most complete fusion of itself and the things which it combines.
- Proportion is best adapted to effect such a union.
- For whenever in any three numbers, whether cube or square, there is a mean, which is to the last term what the first term is to it.
- When the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the mean -- then the mean becoming first and last, and the first and last both becoming means, they will all of them of necessity come to be the same.
- Having become the same with one another will be all one.

If the universal frame had been created a surface only and having no depth, a single mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other terms.


## The Four Fundamental Forces

The world is solid. Solid bodies are always compacted not by one mean but by two. Thus, God placed water [weak] and air [dark energy] in the mean between fire [electromagnetism] and earth [strong].

> *Translator's note, we correct the arrangement of Timaeus from:

[electromagnetism] - [dark energy] -[weak] - [strong]

> into:

[dark energy] - [electromagnetism] -[weak] - [strong]


He made them to have the same proportion so far as was possible (as fire is to air so is air to water, and as air is to water so is water to earth). 
- Thus, He bound and put together a visible and tangible heaven. 
- Out of the four elements, the body of the world was created.
- It was harmonised by proportion, and therefore has the spirit of friendship.
- Having been reconciled to itself, it was indissoluble by the hand of any other than the framer.



The creation took up the whole of each of the four elements, for the Creator compounded the world out of all the fire and all the water and all the air and all the earth. This left no part of any of them nor any power of them outside. His intention was to make the animal:

- a perfect whole and of perfect parts
- be one, leaving no remnants out of which another such world might be created
- be free from old age and unaffected by disease.

Heat and cold and other powerful forces:
- surround and attack bodies
- decompose them, and
- by bringing diseases and old age upon them, make them waste away

This cause and on these grounds he made the world one whole, having every part entire, and being therefore perfect and not liable to old age and disease.

He gave to the world the shape which was suitable and natural.

This is why He gave a body, smooth and even, having a surface in every direction equidistant from the centre, a body entire and perfect, and formed out of perfect bodies.

- In the centre he put the soul, which he diffused throughout the body, making it also to be the exterior environment of it.
- He made the universe a circle moving in a circle, one and solitary, yet by reason of its excellence able to converse with itself, and needing no other friendship or acquaintance. Having these purposes in view he created the world a blessed god.


## How Monads are Made

Altough we say God put the soul in the body, we mean that they were created in a reverse sequence. 

<!-- God brought body and soul together he would never have allowed that the elder should be ruled by the younger. But this is a random manner of speaking which we have, because somehow we ourselves too are very much under the dominion of chance. -->

God first made the soul prior to and older than the body to be its ruler. The body was to be the subject of the soul. <!-- He made her out of the following elements and on this wise=  -->

Out of the indivisible and unchangeable Yang, and also out of the divisible and material Yin, he compounded a third and intermediate kind of essence as idea.

This idea had the nature of the Yang and Yin. He placed this accordingly in a mean between the indivisible Yang and the divisible and material Yin.

He took the three elements of the Yang, Yin, and idea and mingled them into one form. He compressed by force the reluctant and unsociable nature of Yin into Yang. 

He thus mingled them with the idea. From three, it became one monad. He again divided this monad into as many portions as was fitting. Each portion being a compound of the Yang, Yin, and and idea.

He divided it in this way:
- He removed one part of the monad.
- He separated a second part which was double the first [duad]
- He removed a third part which was half as much again as the second and three times as much as the first [triad]
- He took a fourth part which was twice as much as the second [tetrad]
- He took a fifth part [pentad] which was three times the third [9]
- He took a sixth part which was eight times the first [8] [octave]
- He took a seventh part which was 27 times the first. 
- He then filled up the double intervals [i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8] and the triple [i.e. between 1, 3, 9, 27] cutting off yet other portions from the mixture and placing them in the intervals.

In this way, there were two kinds of means in each interval. 
- The one exceeding and exceeded by equal parts of its extremes [as for example 1, 4/3, 2, in which the mean 4/3 is one-third of 1 more than 1, and one-third of 2 less than 2]. 
- The other being that kind of mean which exceeds and is exceeded by an equal number. Where there were intervals of 3/2 and of 4/3 and of 9/8, made by the connecting terms in the former intervals, he filled up all the intervals of 4/3 with the interval of 9/8, leaving a fraction over.

The interval which this fraction expressed was in the ratio of 256 to 243. Thus, the whole mixture out of which he cut these portions was all exhausted by him.

This entire compound of Creation he divided lengthwise into two parts, which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter X. He bent them into a circular form, connecting them with themselves and each other at the point opposite to their original meeting-point.

Comprehending them in a uniform revolution upon the same axis, he made the one the outer and the other the inner circle.

- The motion of the outer circle, He called the motion of the Yang
- The motion of the inner circle, He called the motion of Yin
- The motion of the Yang he carried around by the side to the right
- The motion of the Yin diagonally to the left. 
- He gave dominion to the motion of the Yang by leaving the left side single and undivided.

## The Seven Chakras within the Monad

But the inner motion he divided in six places and made seven unequal circles
- Their sizes had ratios of two and three, three of each
- Each had orbits [rotation] proceed in a direction opposite to one another.
- Three he made to move with equal swiftness.
- The remaining four move with unequal swiftness to the three and to one another, but in due proportion.

The Creator thus created the soul according to His will. He formed within her the corporeal universe, and brought the two together, uniting them centre to centre*.


> *Translator's note= The center of the chakras in the physical body is also in line with that of the soul


The soul, interfused everywhere from the centre to the circumference of heaven, of which also she is the external envelopment, herself turning in herself, began a divine beginning of never ceasing and rational life enduring forever. 

The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible. 

The soul partakes of reason and harmony. Its being is made made by the best of intellectual and everlasting natures. It is thus the best of things created. 

The soul is composed of Yang, Yin, and idea. These three are divided in due proportion. In her revolutions, the soul returns upon herself.

Whenever the soul touches anything which has idea, whether single or compounded, it is stirred through all her powers. It declares:
- the Yang or Yin of that idea<!--  the sameness or difference of that thing and some other -->.
- to what individual ideas that idea is related
- how and when that idea is affected both in creation and existence. <!-- the world of generation and in the world of immutable being.  -->

The opinions and beliefs of the soul are sure and certain:
- when reason works with equal truth, whether she be in the circle of Yin or Yang, and silently holds her onward course in the sphere of the monad [Dharma or flow of the Tao]
- when truthful reason is hovering around the material world 
- when the circle of Yin is also moving truly and sends correct sensory perceptions to the whole soul 

But when reason is concerned with the rational, and the circle of Yang moving smoothly declares it, then intelligence and knowledge become perfected. 

If anyone affirms that in which these two are found to be other than the soul, he will say the very opposite of the truth.
