Socrates begins with a summary of the Republic. 

He mentions:
- the division of labour
- distribution of the citizens into classes
- the double nature and training of the guardians
- the community of property and of women and children.

But he makes no mention of the second education, or of the government of philosophers.

Now, he wants to see the ideal State realized. 

set in motion; he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle. But he is unable to invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can only describe what they have seen. 

He fears that the Sophists, who are plentifully supplied with graces of speech, in their erratic way of life having never had a city or house of their own, may through want of experience err in their conception of philosophers and statesmen. ‘And therefore to you I turn, Timaeus, citizen of Locris, who are at once a philosopher and a statesman, and to you, Critias, whom all Athenians know to be similarly accomplished, and to Hermocrates, who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse.’

HERMOCRATES= ‘We will do our best. We have been already preparing.  On our way home, Critias told us of an ancient tradition. It is a tale of Solon. He was the friend of Dropidas my great-grandfather. Dropidas told it to my grandfather Critias. He told it to me when he was 90 years old and I was 10 during the day of the Apaturia called "The Registration of Youth". This was when our parents gave prizes for recitation. Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.

Solon was trying to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from Egypt. If had completed it, then he would have been as distinguished as Homer and Hesiod. 

The legend was about the most famous exploits of the Athenians which were forgotten. 

But the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors. ‘Tell us,’ said the other, ‘the whole story, and where Solon heard the story.’ He replied—There is 

At the head of the Egyptian Delta, where the river Nile divides, is a city called Sais. It was the birthplace of King Amasis, and is under the protection of the goddess Neith or Athene. The citizens are friendly towards the Athenians, believing themselves to be related to them.

Solon went there where he was received with honour. He learned from the Egyptian priests how ignorant he and his countrymen were of antiquity. 

So he told them the tales of Phoroneus and Niobe, and Deucalion and Pyrrha. He tried to count the generations which had since passed. 

An aged priest said to him=

‘O Solon, you Hellenes are are children. There is no tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age. This is because the convulsions of nature are chiefly brought about by the two great agencies of fire and water. Fire is symbolized in the Hellenic tale of young Phaethon. He drove his father’s horses the wrong way. This made them burn up the earth until he was himself burnt up by a thunderbolt. 

At long intervals, a derangement of the heavenly bodies occurs, and then the earth is destroyed by fire. 

At such times, and when fire is the agent, those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore are safer than those who dwell upon high and dry places. The latter are in their turn safer when the danger is from water. 

The Nile is our saviour from fire. There is little rain in Egypt and so we are not harmed by water. 

In other countries, when a deluge comes, the people are swept by the rivers into the sea. This is proven by your own memorials.<!--  which your own and other nations have once had of the famous actions of mankind perish in the waters at certain periods;  -->

The rude survivors in the mountains begin again, knowing nothing of the world before the flood. 

But in Egypt, the traditions of our own and other lands are registered by us forever in our temples. The genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals, Solon, are a mere children’s story. 

You remember one deluge only, but there were many. You know nothing of that fairest and noblest race of which you are a seed or remnant. The memory of them was lost, because there was no written voice among you.

Before the great flood, Athens was the greatest and best of cities. It did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of all. 

<!-- Solon marvelled, and desired to be informed of the particulars. ‘You are welcome to hear them,’ said the priest, ‘both for your own sake and for that of the city, and above all for the sake of  -->

According to our records, the goddess that founded your city 9,000 years ago also founded ours 8,000 years ago. Many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time.

The ancient Athenians had the following castes:
- priests
- artisans
- shepherds, hunters, and husbandmen
- warriors

The warrior caste, like the warriors of Egypt, were separated from the rest. They shields and spears. The goddess first taught this to you, and then the Asiatics which includes us. 

Observe again, what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom, searching out the deep things of the world, and applying them to the use of man.

The goddess chose the site that had the best of climates and produced the wisest men. in no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely to have devotees. There you dwelt as became the children of the gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded of you. 

The most famous action of the ancient Athenians was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis. This great island lay over against the Pillars of Heracles. It was larger than Libya and Asia put together. It was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of which the Mediterranean sea was only the harbour. Wthin the Pillars, the empire of Atlantis reached in Europe to Tyrrhenia and in Libya to Egypt. 

This mighty power was arrayed against Egypt and Hellas and all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. Then your city did bravely, and won renown over the whole earth. For at the peril of her own existence, and when the other Hellenes had deserted her, she repelled the invader, and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the Pillars. 

A little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your warrior race all sank into the earth. The great island of Atlantis also disappeared in the sea. This is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the Atlantic ocean.

Such was the tale, Socrates, which Critias heard from Solon. 

Next we will have Timaeus, a natural philosopher, speak of the origin of the world.

<!-- ; and I noticed when listening to you yesterday, how close the resemblance was between your city and citizens and the ancient Athenian State. But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory. I had heard the old man when I was a child, and though I could not remember the whole of our yesterday’s discourse, I was able to recall every word of this, which is branded into my mind; and I am prepared, Socrates, to rehearse to you the entire narrative. The imaginary State which you were describing may be identified with the reality of Solon, and our antediluvian ancestors may be your citizens. ‘That is excellent, Critias, and very appropriate to a Panathenaic festival; the truth of the story is a great advantage.’ Then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment; first, -->

<!-- Excellent.  , going down to the creation of man, and then I shall receive the men whom he has created, and some of whom will have been educated by you, and introduce them to you as the lost Athenian citizens of whom the Egyptian record spoke. As the law of Solon prescribes, we will bring them into court and acknowledge their claims to citizenship. ‘I see,’ replied Socrates, ‘that I shall be well entertained; and do you, Timaeus, offer up a prayer and begin.’ -->

<!-- TIMAEUS= All men who have any right feeling, at the beginning of any enterprise, call upon the Gods; and he who is about to speak of the origin of the universe has a special need of their aid. May my words be acceptable to them, and may I speak in the manner which will be most intelligible to you and will best express my own meaning!

First, I must distinguish between that which always is and never becomes and which is apprehended by reason and reflection, and that which always becomes and never is and is conceived by opinion with the help of sense. All that becomes and is created is the work of a cause, and that is fair which the artificer makes after an eternal pattern, but whatever is fashioned after a created pattern is not fair. Is the world created or uncreated?—that is the first question. Created, I reply, being visible and tangible and having a body, and therefore sensible; and if sensible, then created; and if created, made by a cause, and the cause is the ineffable father of all things, who had before him an eternal archetype. For to imagine that the archetype was created would be blasphemy, seeing that the world is the noblest of creations, and God is the best of causes. And the world being thus created according to the eternal pattern is the copy of something; and we may assume that words are akin to the matter of which they speak. What is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to belief. And amid the variety of opinions which have arisen about God and the nature of the world we must be content to take probability for our rule, considering that I, who am the speaker, and you, who are the judges, are only men; to probability we may attain but no further.

SOCRATES= Excellent, Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject—proceed.
