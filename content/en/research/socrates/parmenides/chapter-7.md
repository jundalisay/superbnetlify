Does the One as a Whole experience time?  Does it become older and younger than Itself and Others?<!-- , and again, neither younger nor older than itself and others, by virtue of participation in time? -->

<!-- If one is, being must be predicated of it? -->

- To exist is to be in the present time
- To have been is to be at a past time
- To be about to be is to be at a future time

Then the One, since it has being also has time. 

Time is always moving forward. 

This means that the One is always becoming relatively older than Its past Self, since It moves forward in time and experiences more time.

Since the One becomes relatively older than Its past Self, then It [as Its past Self] becomes relatively younger at the same time. Thus, It becomes relatively older and younger than Itself.


## Potential vs Actual 

It becomes older that Its Past Self when it moves from past to the present. <!-- , it gets to the point of time between 'was' and 'will be,' which is 'now'= for surely in going from the past to the future, it cannot skip the present? --> When It actually arrives at the present, It stops from becoming older and is actually older. If it went on, it would never be reached by the present and would stay as potentiality.

Anything that goes on touches both the present and the future. It lets go of the present and seizes the future<!-- , while in process of becoming between them -->.

But that which is potentially becoming cannot skip the present. When it reaches the present, it "is" and ceases to be potential.<!-- , and is then whatever it may happen to be becoming. -->

So the One, when in potentially becoming older, reaches the present, It ceases to be potential and turns to actuality. It is thus actually older than Its past Self when It was just potentially becoming.  

<!-- , and it was becoming older than itself -->.

<!-- And that which is older is older than that which is younger? -->

Then the One of the past is younger than Its current Self<!--  when it reaches the present -->. 

But the current Self is always present with the One during all its being. For whenever it is, it is always now.

Then the One, as the Others, is always both becoming older and younger than Itself.  But as the Whole, it is in <!-- It becomes an --> equal time with Itself.

<!-- But if it becomes or is for an equal time with Itself, then It is of the same age with Itself.  -->

<!-- And that which is of the same age, is neither older nor younger?

The one, then, becoming and being the same time with itself, neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself? -->


<!-- And what are its relations to other things? Is it or does it become older or younger than they? -->

## The Sequence and Cycle of Creation

How is the One related to the Others?

The Others, as a multitude, are more than the One, since many are more than one. <!-- —other would have been one, but the others have multitude, and are more than one?

They will have multitude. And a multitude implies a number larger than one? -->

The lesser is the first to come into existence. This means that the least is the first, and that is the One.

Then the One, of all things that have number, is the first to come into being. 

But all other things have also number, being plural and not singular.

Since the One came into being first, it means that It came before the Others. This means that the Others are younger than the One. 

<!--  must be supposed to have come into being prior to the others, and the others later; and the things which came into being later, are younger than that which preceded them? And so the other things will be younger than the one, and the one older than other things?

What would you say of another question? Can the one have come into being contrary to its own nature, or is that impossible? -->

The One as a Whole has parts= a beginning, middle and end.

The beginning the creation of the Others and the end is the Others being whole again and one. 

<!-- And a beginning, both of the one itself and of all other things, comes into being first of all; and after the beginning, the others follow, until you reach the end?

All these others we shall affirm to be parts of the whole and of the one, which, as soon as the end is reached, has become whole and one? -->

<!-- But the end comes last, and the one is of such a nature as to come into being with the last; and, since the one cannot come into being except in accordance with its own nature, its nature will require that it should come into being after the others, simultaneously with the end. -->

<!-- This means that the One is younger than the others and the Others older than the One. -->

The parts of the whole are also one with the whole. 

<!-- Well, and must not a beginning or any other part of the one or of anything, if it be a part and not parts, being a part, be also of necessity one? -->

The One comes into being together with each part as they come into being. 

<!-- —together with the first part when that comes into being, and together with the second part and with all the rest, and will not be wanting to any part, which is added to any other part until it has reached the last and become one whole; it will be wanting neither to the middle, nor to the first, nor to the last, nor to any of them, while the process of becoming is going on? -->

**Then the One is of the same age with all the others, so that if the one itself does not contradict its own nature, it will be neither prior nor posterior to the others, but simultaneous.**

According to this argument, the One, as the Whole, will be neither older nor younger than the others, nor the Others older than the One. 

But according to the previous argument, the One, as the Others, will be older and younger than the Others and the Others than the one.

In this way, the One exists as a Whole, yet exists as the Others. <!-- After this manner then the one is and has become.  -->
