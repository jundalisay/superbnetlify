<!-- INTRODUCTION

The Crito seems intended to exhibit the character of Socrates in one light only, not as the philosopher, fulfilling a divine mission and trusting in the will of heaven, but simply as the good citizen, who having been unjustly condemned is willing to give up his life in obedience to the laws of the state . . .

The days of Socrates are drawing to a close; the fatal ship has been seen off Sunium, as he is informed by his aged friend and contemporary Crito, who visits him before the dawn has broken; he himself has been warned in a dream that on the third day he must depart. Time is precious, and Crito has come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape. This can be easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making the attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him to perish. He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into the hands of his enemies. Money is already provided by Crito as well as by Simmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in Thessaly and other places.

Socrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the many; whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason only and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man. There was a time when Crito himself had allowed the propriety of this. And although someone will say ‘the many can kill us,’ that makes no difference; but a good life, in other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued. All considerations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be dismissed: the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to escape. Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death before his eyes, shall answer this for him. Before he was condemned they had often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either do evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right. Are these principles to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered? Crito admits that they remain the same. Then is his escape consistent with the maintenance of them? To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.

Socrates proceeds:—Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with him: they will ask, ‘Why does he seek to overturn them?’ and if he replies, ‘They have injured him,’ will not the Laws answer, ‘Yes, but was that the agreement? Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them? Was he not brought into the world and educated by their help, and are they not his parents? He might have left Athens and gone where he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly than any other citizen.’ Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged the agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and danger to his friends. Even in the course of the trial he might have proposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death to exile. And whither will he direct his footsteps? In any well-ordered state the Laws will consider him as an enemy. Possibly in a land of misrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly narrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing tale. But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson. Will he continue to give lectures in virtue? That would hardly be decent. And how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly, and deprives them of Athenian citizenship? Or if he leaves them behind, does he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends because he is in Thessaly? Will not true friends care for them equally whether he is alive or dead?

Finally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and children afterwards. He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil. But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for evil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the Laws of the world below will receive him as an enemy. Such is the mystic voice which is always murmuring in his ears.

That Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during his lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages. The crimes of Alcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still recent in the memory of the now restored democracy. The fact that he had been neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate popular good-will. Plato, writing probably in the next generation, undertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to the Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.

Whether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the proposal of escape is uncertain; Plato could easily have invented far more than that; 1 and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the fittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the hand of the artist. Whether anyone who has been subjected by the laws of his country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a thesis about which casuists might disagree. Shelley 2 is of opinion that Socrates ‘did well to die,’ but not for the ‘sophistical’ reasons which Plato has put into his mouth. And there would be no difficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a glorious death the good which he might still be able to perform. ‘A rhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.’ It may be observed however that Plato never intended to answer the question of casuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to do the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master maintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life. Not ‘the world,’ but the ‘one wise man,’ is still the paradox of Socrates in his last hours. He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may be fatal to him. The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither good nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral evil; in his own words, ‘they cannot make a man wise or foolish.’

This little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the ‘common principle,’ there is no escaping from the conclusion. It is anticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of Homer. The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in the world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which occur in Plato.

<!-- PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, Crito. -->

SCENE: The Prison where Socrates is detained


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Why have you come now that dawn is just breaking, Crito? It must be quite early? I wonder how the keeper of the prison let you in.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
He knows me, because I often come. Moreover, I have done him a kindness. I came some time ago.

I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of all to me.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- {{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then why did you just sit and say nothing, instead of waking me up immediately?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Crito" >}}
I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great trouble and unrest as you are—indeed I should not: 

I have been watching with amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake you, because I wished to minimize the pain. I have always thought you to be of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy, tranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
When a man has reached my age, he should not be repining at the approach of death.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and age does not prevent them from repining.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
That is true. But you have not told me why you come at this early hour.
{{< /l >}} -->



{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What? Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I am to die?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
No, the ship has not actually arrived. But she will probably be here today, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have left her there.

And so tomorrow, will be the last day of your life.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Very well, if it is the will of God, I am willing. But I think it will be delayed by 1 day.

The authorities say that I am to die on the day after the arrival of the ship

But I do not think that the ship will be here until tomorrow because I had a vision of it last night when you fortunately allowed me to sleep.

There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely, clothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said: O Socrates The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.’ 3
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
Yes; the meaning is only too clear. 

But my beloved Socrates! Please take my advice and escape. If you die I shall lose a friend who can never be replaced. 

People who do not know us will think that I might have saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not care. 

That would be the worst disgrace -- that I should be thought to value money more than the life of a friend! People will not be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
But why should we care about the opinion of the many? 

Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering, will think of these things truly as they occurred.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
But you see, that the opinion of the many must be regarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good opinion.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I only wish it were so, and that the many could do the greatest evil. 

For then they would also be able to do the greatest good—and what a fine thing this would be! But in reality they can do neither; for they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is the result of chance.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Crito" >}}
I will not dispute with you. But are you acting out of regard to me and your other friends? 

Or are you afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with the informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a great part of our property? or that even a worse evil may happen to us? 

If you fear on our account, do not worry. If we ever run into a greater risk, you should do as I say.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means the only one.
{{< /l >}}
