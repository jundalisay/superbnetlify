Imitation is only a kind of play or sport. 

The tragic poets are imitators in the highest degree. Imitation is concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth. 

Imitation addresses what faculty in man?

A body is large when seen near. 
- It appears small when seen from afar. 

The same object appears straight when seen out of the water, and crooked when in the water. The concave becomes convex due to the illusion on colours to which the sight is liable.

**Thus, every confusion comes from within us.**

This is that weakness in the inferior part of the human mind that is imposed on by illusory tricks which affects us like magic. <!--   the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes. It has an effect upon us . -->

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The arts of measuring, counting, and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding. These free us from the uncertainty of greater or less, or more or heavier. The better part of the soul to measure and calculation.
<!-- They give ground to calculation, measure, and weight. This surely is the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul. When this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction. But we said that such a contradiction is impossible. -->

<!-- The same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing. This means that the part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that part which has an opinion in accordance with measure.  -->
<!-- That which is opposed to them is the inferior part. This was the conclusion that I was seeking when I said that painting and imitation are far removed from truth. They are the companions and friends of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason. They have no true or healthy aim. -->

The imitative art is an inferior one who marries an inferior, and has inferior offspring. This inferiority extends itself to sight and hearing with regards to poetry. 

Imitation imitates the actions of men, whether voluntary or involuntary. This results in a man not being in unity with himself.

<!-- {{< r a="Glaucon" >}} Probably the same would be true of poetry.{{< /r >}} -->

<!-- Do not rely on a probability derived from the analogy of painting. Is the faculty concerned with which poetical imitation good or bad? -->
<!-- They then imagine that a good or bad result has ensued. They then rejoice or sorrow accordingly. But in all this variety of circumstances, is the man at ? -->
  

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
In our example on sight, there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things. So here also, there is strife and inconsistency in his life.

The soul is full of these and 10,000 similar oppositions occurring at the same time. We said that a good man who has lost his son will bear the loss with more equanimity than a man who is not good.

He will moderate his sorrow. He is more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is alone. When he is by himself, he can do many things which he would be ashamed of. There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him to resist his sadness. <!-- , as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow. --> 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
But when a man is drawn in 2 opposite directions, to and from the same object, it implies 2 distinct principles in him. 

One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law which would say:

- that it is best to be patient under suffering,
- that we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil, and
- that nothing is gained by impatience, because no human thing is of serious importance.


The other principle is grief which stands in the way of taking counsel about what has happened. This counsel is most needed. It says that when the dice has been thrown, we should order our affairs in the way that reason deems best. 

We should do this not like children who have fallen and waste time in crying. Instead, we should do it always accustoming the soul to:

- apply a remedy,
- raise up that which is sickly and fallen, and
- banish the cry of sorrow by the healing art.

{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Yes, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason. The other principle inclines us to remember our troubles. 

The irrational, useless, and cowardly have the inferior principle. The rebellious principle furnishes many materials for imitation.

The wise and calm temperament is always nearly equable. It is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre because the feeling represented is new to them. 

The imitative poet who aims at being popular does not target the rational principle in the soul. Like the painter, he instead will target the passionate temper, the inferior part of the soul, which is easily imitated.
<!-- We can place him beside the painter, for he is like him in two ways:

- His creations have an inferior degree of truth.
- He is also concerned with an .
 -->

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Therefore, we should ban him from a well-ordered State because he awakens and strengthens the feelings and impairs reason. The imitative poet implants an evil constitution in the soul because he:

- indulges the irrational nature,
- manufactures images, and
- is very far removed from the truth.


This irrational nature has no discernment. It thinks the same thing at one time great and at another small. Our heaviest accusation is that the power of poetry harms even the good (and there are very few who are not harmed).

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Imagine Homer or one of the tragedians representing some pitiful hero crying in a long oration. We would give way to sympathy. But when we ourselves are sad, we pride ourselves on being quiet, patient, and manly. The man crying loudly is doing the part of a woman. We cannot praise a person who is doing a shameful thing. Our reason teaches us not to cry loudly. 

But poets aim for this sympathy which we get since the sorrow is from another person. We, as spectators, fancy that it is not disgraceful to praise or pity the suffering person because it means that it is not us who are suffering. 

<!-- But this is reasonable if you consider that when in misfortune, we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation.
This feeling is kept under control in our own calamities and is satisfied and delighted by the .
 -->
<!-- The better nature in each of us is not sufficiently trained by reason or habit -->

<!-- It allows the sympathetic element to break loose because 

He thinks that the pleasure is a gain.
Why should he be supercilious and lose this gain and the poem too?
 -->

The people do not think that when they think of the evil of other men, something of evil is communicated to themselves. In time, the sadness at the sight of the misfortunes of others gathers and becomes more difficult to repress.

This is also true for laughter. There are jokes which you would be ashamed to make yourself. Yet when you hear them on the comic stage, or in private, you are greatly amused.You are not at all disgusted at them and so the laughter gathers strength too. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
There is a principle in human nature which makes us laugh. This is restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon. Comedy makes it come out again. It stimulates the humorous faculty. It unconsciously betrays you into playing the comic at home. The same may be said of lust, anger, and all the other affections, pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action.

In all of them, poetry feeds the passions instead of drying them up. She lets them rule, even if they should be controlled. Therefore, Glaucon, we should love the excellent eulogists of Homer who say that:

- he has been the educator of Hellas,
- he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things,
- you should read him again and again to regulate your life according to him.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers. But we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry allowed into our State. If you disobey this and allow the honeyed muse to enter in epic or lyric verse, then pleasure and pain will rule the State.

<!-- Our current defense shows the reasonableness of that purgation. Back then, reason constrained us from being harsh to bad poetry. -->

We have previously purged bad poetry out of our State. There is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry, as proven by the sayings:

- 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,'
- 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,'
- 'the mob of sages circumventing Zeus,' and
- 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after all'

{{< /l >}}
<!-- There are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them. If the arts of imitation can prove her title to exist in a well-ordered State, then we shall be delighted to receive her. We are very conscious of her charms. But we may not on that account betray the truth. --> 



{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Imitative poetry can be allowed to return from exile only on the condition that she make her defence in lyrical or some other metre. The lovers of poetry, but not yet poets, can speak in prose on her behalf. Let them show that she is pleasant and useful to people.

<!-- If this is proven, then we shall surely be the gainers if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight.
People restrain themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests.
In the same way, we must give up poetry, with a struggle. -->

We too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble States has implanted in us. We want her to appear at her best and truest. But as long as she is unable to defend herself, our argument shall be a mantra to us. We will repeat it to ourselves while we listen to her strains. In this way, we will not fall into the childish love of her which captivates many.

Imitative poetry does not attain the truth. People should be on guard against her seductions. They must not neglect justice and virtue from the influence of honour, money, power under the excitement of poetry.

He should make our words his law.
