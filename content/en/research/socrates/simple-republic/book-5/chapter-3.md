{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then let us enact this law that our guardians are neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Yes, these and all our previous enactments, are very good. But how can it be done? 

<!-- is such an order of things possible, and how, if at all?
Your plan would do all sorts of good to the State if it were feasible. -->
Your citizens will be the bravest of warriors. They will all know one another and will call the other father, brother, son. If the women will join their armies then they will be absolutely invincible. There are many domestic advantages as well. But how to we bring about such a State?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
We ended up here through our search for justice and injustice. <!-- If we have discovered them, we could be satisfied with an approximation of absolute justice, and a higher degree of justice. --> In order to have an ideal, we enquired into:
- the nature of absolute justice,
- the character of the perfectly just,
- the nature of injustice,
- the character of the perfectly unjust.


We looked at these so that we could compare our own happiness and unhappiness to the standard, without imagining how that standard could exist in reality. A painter would not be any worse if he painted an ideal man, but was unable to show how such a man could exist. 

We were creating an ideal of a perfect State. Our theory is not worse because we are unable to prove the possibility of such an ideal city. Are "ideals" ever fully realized in language?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
The word "ideal" expresses not an actual fact.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Whatever a man may think always naturally falls short of the truth. You must not insist the actual State will coincide with the ideal in every respect. If we are only able to discover how a city may be governed as ideally as possible, then we have achieved our goal. I will next show:
- what causes the present maladministration in States, and
- what is the smallest change that will enable a State to pass into the truer form.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The changes should be as few and slight as possible. There might be a reform of the State if only one change were made. This is not small or easy, but it is still possible. The greatest change is like the greatest of the waves. It can drown me in laughter and dishonour. The human race will always have evils unless:
- philosophers are kings,
- the kings have the spirit and power of philosophy,
- political greatness and wisdom meet in one, or
- those of commoner natures are compelled to stand aside.

Our State will have a possibility of life if those conditions are met.

## Philosophers as Rulers of the Ideal State

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Philosophers are to rule in the State. Not all people are meant to be philosopher-leaders. But those who are should study philosophy and be leaders in the State. 

A lover should show his love to the whole. Young people raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast. Sensual people praise a charming face and say that:
- a hook-nose is a royal look
- a snub nose is a fair look
- a regular look is to have neither a hook-nose or a snub nose
{{< /l >}}
<!-- They say that a dark visage is manly and a fair one is a child of the gods.
Wine-lovers do the same.

They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine. -->

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Ambitious men are willing to command a file if they cannot command an army. If they cannot be honoured by important persons, they are glad to be honoured by lesser people. They must have some kind of honour.

A person who desires any class of goods, desire the whole class. The philosopher is a lover of the whole of wisdom. A person who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly called a philosopher.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
If curiosity makes a philosopher, then many are philosophers.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
All the lovers of sights have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. This includes musical amateurs who are the last persons in the world who would come to a philosophical discussion. Are these all philosophers?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Certainly not, they are only an imitation.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The true philosophers are the lovers of the vision of truth. Beauty is the opposite of ugliness, but is one with it. The same is true for the just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class. 

But they have various combinations in actions and things and appear to be many. This is my distinction between the sight-loving, art-loving, practical class and those of truth-loving class who are alone worthy to be called philosophers.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
How do you distinguish them?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The lovers of sounds and sights are fond of fine tones, colours, forms, and all the artificial products made out of them.  But their mind cannot see nor love absolute beauty. Few can see it. <b>He who has a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty.</b>

The dreamer likens dissimilar things and puts a copy in the place of the real object.But the person who recognises absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from its objects. He  does not put the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects. He is awake and not a dreamer.

The dreamer has opinion only. The awake person has knowledge. If the dreamer disputes us, we shall we assure him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have. We ask him= Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? <!-- (You must answer for him.) -->
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
He knows something.
{{< /r >}}


## Knowledge is a Sense or Faculty

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
An absolute being can be absolutely known, but an utterly non-existent being is utterly unknown. If there is anything that exists and not exists, then it will be in-between pure being and the absolute negation of being.

Knowledge corresponds to being*. Ignorance corresponds to not-being. The intermediate between being and not-being has a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge. 

The existence of opinion is the same with the existence of knowledge or some other faculty. Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties. Knowledge is relative to being and knows being.
{{< /l >}}

> *Superphysics Note: Being here is the same as Existence. Hume defines truth as the equivalence between perception and existence. Therefore, knowledge is the match between ideas and perceptions, with the ideas being 'facts'. Opinion is the possible equivalence of ideas and perceptions. Truth, knowlege, and opinion are therefore dependent on the faculty of perception, which is why Plato assigns knowledge and opnion as faculties. Knowledge and opinion differ between humans because humans have different levels of perception, just as some humans are color-blind, short-sighted, deaf, ignorant, etc.


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
<!-- But before I proceed further I will make a division. --> I place faculties in a class by themselves. They are powers in us that lets us do as we do.

For example, I call sight and hearing as faculties. If I do not see something then the distinctions of figure, colour, etc. do not apply to them. In speaking of a faculty, I think only of its scope and its result. 

The same faculty has the same scope and the same result. Another faculty has a different sphere and result. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Knowledge is the mightiest of all faculties. Opinion is also a faculty. Opinion is the faculty that lets us form an opinion. Knowledge is not the same as opinion because no one will mistake an infallible thing with an erroneous thing.

Knowledge and opinion have distinct powers and distinct scopes or subject-matters. 
- Being is the subject-matter of knowledge. To have knowledge is to know the nature of being.
- Opinion is the subject-matter of opinion. To have an opinion is to have a limited or biased knowledge.<!--  try to know the nature of a being, but fail in actually knowing it. -->

<!--   We do not know something and so we only have an opinion of it.  -->
<!-- Do we know what we opine, or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
No, that has been already disproven. -->
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
The difference in faculty implies a difference in the subject-matter. Opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties which have different subject-matters.
{{< /r >}}



## The Nature of Opinion

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What is the subject-matter of opinion? It cannot be being, yet it cannot be not-being or nothing. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Yes, it is impossible to have an opinion on nothing. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Therefore, the subject-matter of opinion is the in-between of knowledge and ignorance.

<!-- Is not-being the subject-matter of opinion?
How can there be an opinion at all about not-being?
When a man has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something?
Can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing?
Can he who has an opinion have an opinion about some one thing?
Is not-being is not one thing but nothing?
Does ignorance correlate to not-being?
Does knowledge correlate with being?

Opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being. Therefore, opinion cannot be ignorance nor knowledge. -->

<!-- But opinion is not to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance.
Then I suppose that opinion appears to you as both as darker than knowledge and lighter than ignorance, and is within and between them.
Then we can infer that opinion is intermediate.
But if anything is both is and is not at the same time, then that thing would appear between pure being and absolute not-being.
The corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be in the interval between them.
In that interval, there has now been discovered something which we call "opinion".
Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and not-being. -->

This 'in-between' cannot be rightly called as "pure" and "simple". Instead, we can call this "the subject of opinion."

<!-- We can assign each to their proper faculty.
The extremes are assigned to the faculties of the extremes.
The middle are assigned to the faculty of the middle.
Some people think that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty.
They think that the beautiful is the manifold.
They cannot believe that beauty is one or that anything is one.
I will ask them if:
of all these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly,
of the just, which will not be found unjust, or
of the holy, which will not also be unholy?
No, the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly

The same is true of the rest.
The many which are doubles may be also halves. -->

The double of one thing is a double to the perspective of that thing. But to the perspective of an outsider, it is the half of that thing. The same is true for big and small, heavy and light, beautiful and ugly. The multiple variations of beautiful and ugly are created by the different opinions of the multitude from their various perspectives. 
{{< /l >}}
<!-- and depend on the  -->
<!-- , as they are termed, will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names. -->.
<!-- Can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?
They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts.

The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense. -->
{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
You cannot fix this duality or its variations in your mind, either as being or not-being, both, or neither. Then what will you do with them?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- They can have a better place than being in-between being and not-being. -->

<!-- For they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence than being.
Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and pure not-being?
Yes. We agreed that anything of this kind would be an opinion and not knowledge. -->


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
This duality is the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty of opinion.

Those who see the absolute, eternal, and immutable have knowledge and not opinion only. These love the subjects of knowledge.

But those who have no knowledge and only opinion are those who:
- see only relative beauties but not the absolute beauty
- follow any guide who points the way those relative beauties
- see the relative justice, but not absolute justice
- love the subjects of opinion
- listen to sweet sounds and gaze on fair colours

They would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty. We can call them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom.

They might be angry at us for this.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
I shall tell them not to be angry. No man should be angry at what is true.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Those who love the truth in each thing are to be called "lovers of wisdom" and not "lovers of opinion".
{{< /l >}}
