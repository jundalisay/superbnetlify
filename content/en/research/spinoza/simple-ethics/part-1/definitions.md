## Definitions:

n | Name | Definition
--- | --- | ---
1. | Self—caused | something of which the essence involves existence
2. | Finite thing | a thing that can be limited by another thing of the same nature

For instance:
- a body is finite because we always conceive another greater body
- a thought is limited by another thought

But:
- a body is not limited by thought
- a thought is not limited by a body*

> *Superphysics Note: In Superphysics, this is because either one lives in a different domain

3. | Substance | something in itself and conceived through itself. It can be conceived independently of any other conception.
4. | Attribute | the essence of substance
5. | Mode | a modification of substance
<!-- , or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself. -->
6. God | a being absolutely infinite

God is a substance having infinite attributes. Each attribute expresses eternal and infinite essentiality. 

This means that God is absolutely infinite, and not infinite after its kind. This is because infinite attributes may be denied for a thing infinite only after its kind. 

But something absolutely infinite contains in its essence whatever expresses reality and involves no negation.

7. | Free thing | something that exists solely by itself and acts by itself alone
8. | Necessary or constrained thing | something that is determined by something external 
<!-- to itself, to a fixed and definite method of existence or action. -->
9. | Eternity | existence itself [without the time factor]
<!-- , in so far as it is conceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of that which is eternal. -->

<!-- - Existence of this kind is conceived as an eternal truth, like the essence of a thing. -->
- Therefore, it cannot be explained through continuance or time, though continuance may be conceived without a beginning or end.



## Axioms

1. Everything which exists, exists either in itself or in something else.

2. That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through itself.

3. From a given definite cause, an effect necessarily follows.
    - On the other hand, if there is no definite cause, it is impossible that an effect can follow.

4. The knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the knowledge of a cause.

5. Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the one by means of the other.
    - The conception of one does not involve the conception of the other.

6. A true idea must correspond with its ideate or object.

7. If a thing can be conceived as non—existing, its essence does not involve existence.
