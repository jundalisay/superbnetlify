1. No positive quality possessed by a false idea is removed by the presence of what is true, in virtue of its being true. 

<!-- Proof=  Falsehood consists solely in the privation of knowledge which inadequate ideas involve (2.35), nor have they any positive quality on account of which they are called false (2.33.)
Contrariwise, in so far as they are referred to God, they are true (2.32.).
Wherefore, if the positive quality possessed by a false idea were removed by the presence of what is true, in virtue of its being true, a true idea would then be removed by itself, which (4.3.) is absurd.
Therefore, no positive quality possessed by a false idea, etc. Q.E.D.
Note=  This proposition is more clearly understood from 2.16 Coroll.

2. Imagination is an idea which indicates the human body's present disposition, than the nature of the external body not distinctly, but confusedly. Whence it comes to pass, that the mind is said to err.

<!-- For instance, when we look at the sun, we conceive that it is distant from us about 200 feet.
In this judgment we err, so long as we are in ignorance of its true distance;
When its true distance is known, the error is removed, but not the imagination; or,
in other words, the idea of the sun, which only explains tho nature of that luminary, in so far as the body is affected thereby= 
Wherefore, though we know the real distance, we shall still nevertheless imagine the sun to be near us.
For, as we said in 2.35. note, we do not imagine the sun to be so near us, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the mind conceives the magnitude of the sun to the extent that the body is affected thereby.
Thus, when the rays of the sun falling on the surface of water are reflected into our eyes, we imagine the sun as if it were in the water, though we are aware of its real position; and similarly other imaginations, wherein the mind is deceived, whether they indicate the natural disposition of the body, or that its power of activity is increased or diminished, are not contrary to the truth, and do not vanish at its presence.
It happens indeed that, when we mistakenly fear an evil, the fear vanishes when we hear the true tidings;
but the contrary also happens, namely, that we fear an evil which will certainly come, and our fear vanishes when we hear false tidings; thus imaginations do not vanish at the presence of the truth, in virtue of its being true, but because other imaginations, stronger than the first, supervene and exclude the present existence of that which we imagined, as I have shown in 2.17. -->



2. We are only passive, in so far as we are apart of Nature, which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts. 

<!-- Proof=  We are said to be passive, when something arises in us, whereof we are only a partial cause (3. Def. 2), that is (3. Def. 1), something which cannot be deduced solely from the laws of our nature.
We are passive therefore, in so far as we are a part of Nature, which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts. Q.E.D. -->


3. The force whereby a man persists in existing is limited, and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes. 

<!-- Proof=  This is evident from the axiom of this part.
For, when man is given, there is something else—say A—more powerful;
When A is given, there is something else—say B—more powerful than A, and so on to infinity;
Thus the power of man is limited by the power of some other thing, and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes. Q.E.D.
  Proposition 4. It is impossible, that man should not be a part of Nature, or that he should be capable of undergoing no changes, save such as can be understood through his nature only as their adequate cause. Proof=  The power, whereby each particular thing, and consequently man, preserves his being, is the power of God or of Nature (1.24. Coroll.).
Not in so far as it is infinite, but in so far as it can be explained by the actual human essence (3.7.).
Thus the power of man, in so far as it is explained through his own actual essence, is a part of the infinite power of God or Nature, in other words, of the essence thereof (1.34.).
This was our first point.
Again, if it were possible, that man should undergo no changes save such as can be understood solely through the nature of man, it would follow that he would not be able to die, but would always necessarily exist; this would be the necessary consequence of a cause whose power was either finite or infinite.
Namely, either of man's power only, inasmuch as he would be capable of removing from himself all changes which could spring from external causes; or of the infinite power of Nature, whereby all individual things would be so ordered, that man should be incapable of undergoing any changes save such as tended towards his own preservation.
But the first alternative is absurd (by the last Prop., the proof of which is universal, and can be applied to all individual things).
Therefore, if it is possible that man should not be capable of undergoing any changes, save such as can be explained solely through his own nature, and consequently that he must always necessarily exist; such a result must follow from God's infinite power and consequently (1.16.) from the necessity of the divine nature, as it is regarded as affected by the idea of any given man, the whole order of nature as conceived under the attributes of extension and thought must be deducible.
It would therefore follow (1.21.) that man is infinite, which (by the first part of this proof) is absurd. It is, therefore, impossible, that man should not undergo any changes save those whereof he is the adequate cause. Q.E.D. -->

<!-- Corollary=  It follows, that man is necessarily always a prey to his passions, that he follows and obeys the general order of nature, and that he accommodates himself thereto, as much as the nature of things demands.    -->


5. The power and increase of every passion, and its persistence in existing are not defined by the power, whereby we ourselves endeavour to persist in existing, but by the power of an external cause compared with our own. 

<!-- Proof=  The essence of a passion cannot be explained through our essence alone (3. Def. 1. and 2.), that is (3.7.), the power of a passion cannot be defined by the power, whereby we ourselves endeavour to persist in existing, but (as is shown in 2.16.) must necessarily be defined by the power of an external cause compared with our own. Q.E.D.  -->


6. The force of any passion or emotion can overcome the rest of a man's activities or power, so that the emotion becomes obstinately fixed to him. 

<!-- Proof=  The force and increase of any passion and its persistence in existing are defined by the power of an external cause compared with our own (by the foregoing Prop.);
Therefore (4.3.) it can overcome a man's power, &e. Q.E.D. -->



7. An emotion can only be controlled or destroyed by another emotion contrary thereto, and with more power for controlling emotion. 

<!-- Proof=  Emotion, in so far as it is referred to the mind, is an idea, whereby the mind affirms of its body a greater or less force of existence than before (cf. the general Definition of the Emotions at the end of Part 3).
When, therefore, the mind is assailed by any emotion, the body is at the same time affected with a modification whereby its power of activity is increased or diminished.
This modification of the body (4.5.) receives from its cause the force for persistence in its being;
which force can only be checked or destroyed by a bodily cause (2.6), in virtue of the body being affected with a modification contrary to (3.5.) and stronger than itself (4. Ax.);
Wherefore (2.12.) the mind is affected by the idea of a modification contrary to, and stronger than the former modification, in other words, (by the general definition of the emotions) the mind will be affected by an emotion contrary to and stronger than the former emotion, which will exclude or destroy the existence of the former emotion; thus an emotion cannot be destroyed nor controlled except by a contrary and stronger emotion. Q.E.D.
  Corollary=  An emotion, in so far as it is referred to the mind, can only be controlled or destroyed through an idea of a modification of the body contrary to, and stronger than, that which we are undergoing.
For the emotion which we undergo can only be checked or destroyed by an emotion contrary to, and stronger than, itself, in other words, (by the general Definition of the Emotions) only by an idea of a modification of the body contrary to, and stronger than, the modification which we undergo. -->


8. The knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the emotions of pleasure or pain, in so far as we are conscious thereof. 

<!-- Proof=  We call a thing good or evil, when it is of service or the reverse in preserving our being (4. Def. 1 and 2), that is (3.7.), when it increases or diminishes, helps or hinders, our power of activity.
Thus, in so far as we perceive that a thing affects us with pleasure or pain, we call it good or evil; wherefore the knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the idea of the pleasure or pain, which necessarily follows from that pleasurable or painful emotion (2.22.).
But this idea is united to the emotion in the same way as mind is united to body (2.21.)
That is, there is no real distinction between this idea and the emotion or idea of the modification of the body, save in conception only.
Therefore the knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the emotion, in so far as we are conscious thereof. Q.E.D. -->


9. An emotion, whereof we conceive the cause to be with us at the present time, is stronger than if we did not conceive the cause to be with us. 

<!-- Proof=  Imagination or conception is the idea, by which the mind regards a thing as present (2. 17. note), but which indicates the disposition of the mind rather than the nature of the external thing (2.16. Coroll. 2.).
An emotion is therefore a conception, in so far as it indicates the disposition of the body.
But a conception (by 2.17.) is stronger, so long as we conceive nothing which excludes the present existence of the external object.
Wherefore an emotion is also stronger or more intense, when we conceive the cause to be with us at the present time, than when we do not conceive the cause to be with us. Q.E.D.
Note=  When I said above in 3.18. that we are affected by the image of what is past or future with the same emotion as if the thing conceived were present, I expressly stated, that this is only true in so far as we look solely to the image of the thing in question itself;
for the thing's nature is unchanged, whether we have conceived it or not;
I did not deny that the image becomes weaker, when we regard as present to us other things which exclude the present existence of the future object= 
I did not expressly call attention to the fact, because I purposed to treat of the strength of the emotions in this part of my work. -->

<!-- Corollary=  The image of something past or future, that is, of a thing which we regard as in relation to time past or time future, to the exclusion of time present, is, when other conditions are equal, weaker than the image of something present.
Consequently an emotion felt towards what is past or future is less intense, other conditions being equal, than an emotion felt towards something present. -->


10. Towards something future, which we conceive as close at hand, we are affected more intensely, than if we conceive that its time for existence is separated from the present by a longer interval; so too by the remembrance of what we conceive to have not long passed away we are affected more intensely, than if we conceive that it has long passed away.

<!-- Proof=  In so far as we conceive a thing as close at hand, or not long passed away, we conceive that which excludes the presence of the object less, than if its period of future existence were more distant from the present, or if it had long passed away (this is obvious) therefore (by the foregoing Prop.) we are, so far, more intensely affected towards it. Q.E.D.  -->

<!-- Corollary=  From the remarks made in Def. vi. of this part it follows that, if objects are separated from the present by a longer period than we can define in conception, though their dates of occurrence be widely separated one from the other, they all affect us equally faintly.  -->


11. An emotion towards that which we conceive as necessary is, when other conditions are equal, more intense than an emotion towards that which possible, or contingent, or non—necessary. 

<!-- Proof=  In so far as we conceive a thing to be necessary, we, to that extent, affirm its existence; on the other hand we deny a thing's existence, in so far as we conceive it not to be necessary (1.33. note. 1.).
Wherefore (4.9.) an emotion towards that which is necessary is, other conditions being equal, more intense than an emotion that which is non—necessary. Q.E.D. -->
  

12. An emotion towards a thing, which we know not to exist at the present time, and which we conceive as possible, is more intense, other conditions being equal, than an emotion towards a thing contingent. 

<!-- Proof=  In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent, we are affected by the conception of some further thing, which would assert the existence of the former (4. Def. 3).
But, on the other hand, we (by hypothesis) conceive certain things, which exclude its present existence.
But, in so far as we conceive a thing to be possible in the future, we there by conceive things which assert its existence (4.4.), that is (3.18.), things which promote hope or fear=  wherefore an emotion towards something possible is more vehement. Q.E.D.

Corollary=  An emotion towards a thing, which we know not to exist in the present, and which we conceive as contingent, is far fainter, than if we conceive the thing to be present with us. Proof=  Emotion towards a thing, which we conceive to exist, is more intense than it would be, if we conceived the thing as future (4.9. Coroll.), and is much more vehement, than if the future time be conceived as far distant from the present (4.10.).

Therefore an emotion towards a thing, whose period of existence we conceive to be far distant from the present, is far fainter, than if we conceive the thing as present.
It is, nevertheless, more intense, than if we conceived the thing as contingent, wherefore an emotion towards a thing, which we regard as contingent, will be far fainter, than if we conceived the thing to be present with us. Q.E.D. -->


13. Emotion towards a thing contingent, which we know not to exist in the present, is, other conditions being equal, fainter than an emotion towards a thing past. 

<!-- Proof=  In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent, we are not affected by the image of any other thing, which asserts the existence of the said thing (4. Def. 3), but, on the other hand (by hypothesis), we conceive certain things excluding its present existence.
But, in so far as we conceive it in relation to time past, we are assumed to conceive something, which recalls the thing to memory, or excites the image thereof (2.18. and note), which is so far the same as regarding it as present (2.17. Coroll.).
Therefore (4.9.) an emotion towards a thing contingent, which we know does not exist in the present, is fainter, other conditions being equal, than an emotion towards a thing past. Q.E.D.
