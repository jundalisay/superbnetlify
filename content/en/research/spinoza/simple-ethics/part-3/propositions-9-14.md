### 9. The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas, endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this endeavour it is conscious.

<!-- Proof=  The essence of the mind is constituted by adequate and inadequate ideas (3.3), therefore (3.7), both in so far as it possesses the former, and in so far as it possesses the latter, it endeavours to persist in its own being, and that for an indefinite time (3.8).

Now as the mind (2.23) is necessarily conscious of itself through the ideas of the modifications of the body, the mind is therefore (3.7) conscious of its own endeavour.
Note=  This endeavour, when referred solely to the mind, is called will.

When referred to the mind and body in conjunction it is called appetite; it is, in fact, nothing else but man's essence, from the nature of which necessarily follow all those results which tend to its preservation; and
which man has thus been determined to perform.
Further, between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that the term desire is generally applied to men, in so far as they are conscious of their appetite, and may accordingly be thus defined= 
Desire is appetite with consciousness thereof.
It is thus plain from what has been said, that in no case do we strive for, wish for, long for, or desire anything, because we deem it to be good, but on the other hand we deem a thing to be good, because we strive for it, wish for it, long for it, or desire it.
 -->

### 10. An idea, which excludes the existence of our body, cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.

<!-- Proof=  Whatsoever can destroy our body, cannot be postulated therein (3.5).

Therefore neither can the idea of such a thing occur in God, in so far as he has the idea of our body (2.9. Coroll.).
That is (2.11, 2.13), the idea of that thing cannot be postulated as in our mind, but contrariwise, since (2.11, 2.13) the first element, that constitutes the essence of the mind, is the idea of the human body as actually existing, it follows that the first and chief endeavour of our mind is the endeavour to affirm the existence of our body= 
Thus, an idea, which negatives the existence of our body, is contrary to our mind, etc. Q.E.D.
 -->

### 11. Whatsoever increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of activity in our body, the idea thereof increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind. 

<!-- Proof=  This proposition is evident from 2.7. or from 2.14. Note=  Thus we see, that the mind can undergo many changes, and can pass sometimes to a state of greater perfection, sometimes to a state of lesser perfection.
These passive states of transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain.
Pleasure signifies a passive state wherein the mind passes to a greater perfection.
I shall call pleasure, in reference to the body and mind together, as stimulation or merriment.
Pain signifies a passive state wherein the mind passes to a lesser perfection.
I shall call pain as suffering or melancholy.
We must remember that stimulation and suffering are attributed to man, when one part of his nature is more affected than the rest, merriment and melancholy, when all parts are alike affected.
I have explained desire in the note to Prop. 9 of this part.
Beyond these three, I recognize no other primary emotion.
I will show that all other emotions arise from these three.
But, before I go further, I should like here to explain at greater length Prop. 10 of this part, in order that we may clearly understand how one idea is contrary to another.
In the note to 2.17 we showed that the idea, which constitutes the essence of mind, involves the existence of body, so long as the body itself exists.
It follows from what we pointed out in the Corollary to 2.8, that our mind's present existence depends solely on the fact that the mind involves the body's actual existence.
Lastly, we showed (2.17, 2.18, and note) that the mind's power in imagining and remembering things, also depends on the fact, that it involves the body's actual existence.
It follows, that the mind's present existence and its power of imagining are removed, as soon as the mind ceases to affirm the body's present existence.
The cause why the mind ceases to affirm the body's existence cannot be the mind itself (3. 4), nor again the fact that the body ceases to exist.
For (by 2.6) the cause, why the mind affirms the existence of the body, is not that the body began to exist.
Therefore, for the same reason, it does not cease to affirm the body's existence, because the body ceases to exist.
But (2.17) this result follows from another idea, which excludes the body's present existence and, consequently, of our mind, and which is therefore contrary to the idea constituting the essence of our mind.
 -->

12. As far as it can, the mind endeavours to conceive things which increases or helps the power of activity in the body. 

<!-- Proof=  So long as the human body is affected in a mode, which involves the nature of any external body, the human mind will regard that external body as present (2.17).
Consequently (2.7), so long as the human mind regards an external body as present, that is (2.17. note), conceives it, the human body is affected in a mode, which involves the nature of the said external body.
Thus, so long as the mind conceives things, which increase or help the power of activity in our body, the body is affected in modes which increase or help its power of activity (3. Post. 1).
Consequently, (3.11) the mind's power of thinking is for that period increased or helped.
Thus (3.6., 3.9) the mind, as far as it can, endeavours to imagine such things. Q.E.D.
 -->

13. When the mind conceives things which reduce or hinder the body's power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible, to remember things which exclude the existence of the first-named things. 

<!-- Proof=  So long as the mind conceives anything of the kind alluded to, the power of the mind and body is reducedc or constrained (cf. 3. 12. Proof).
Nevertheless, it will continue to conceive it, until the mind conceives something else, which excludes the present existence thereof (2.17).
That is, the power of the mind and of the body is reduced or constrained, until the mind conceives something else, which excludes the existence of the former thing conceived.
Therefore, the mind (3.9), as far as it can, will endeavour to conceive or remember the latter. Q.E.D. -->

Corollary=  It follows that the mind shrinks from conceiving those things, which reduce or constrain the power of itself and of the body. 

<!-- Note=  From what has been said we may clearly understand the nature of Love and Hate.
Love is nothing but pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause.
Hate is nothing but pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause.
We further see, that he who loves necessarily endeavours to have, and to keep present to him, the object of his love.
While he who hates endeavours to remove and destroy the object of his hatred.
But I will treat of these matters at more length hereafter. -->

14. If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.

<!-- Proof=  If the human body has once been affected by two bodies at once, whenever afterwards the mind conceives one of them, it will straightway remember the other also (2.18).
But the mind's conceptions indicate rather the emotions of our body than the nature of external bodies (2.16. Coroll. 2).
Therefore, if the body, and consequently the mind (3. Def. 3) has been once affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of the two, be also affected by the other.
