description: "Henry George advocated a single land tax to solve recessions. This absurdity comes from his wrongly definiting wages as profit. All profits come from the produce of the land and so he advocates a land tax. We simplify his work here so you won't have to waste time on him, just as you shouldn't waste time on Karl Marx"
