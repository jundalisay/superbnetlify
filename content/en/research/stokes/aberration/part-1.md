The explanation of the aberration is so simple.

<!-- , and the coincidence of
the value of the velocity of light thence deduced with that derived from observations of eclipses
of Jupiter's satellites so remarkable, as to leave no doubt on the mind as to the truth of that
explanation. But when we examine the cause of the phænomenon more closely, it is far from
being so simple as it appears at first sight. On the theory of emissions, indeed, there is little
difficulty; and it would seem that the more particular explanation of the cause of aberration
usually given, which depends on the consideration of the motion of a telescope as light passes
from its object-glass to its cross wires, has reference especially to this theory; for it does not
apply to the theory of undulations, unless we make the rather  -->

It uses the startling hypothesis that the luminiferous aether passes freely through the sides of the telescope and through the earth itself.

<!-- The undulatory theory of light, however, explains so simply and so beautifully the most
complicated phænomena, that we are naturally led to regard aberration as a phænomenon
unexplained by it, but not incompatible with it.The object of the present communication is to attempt an explanation of the cause of aberration which shall be in accordance with the theory of undulations.  -->

The planets carry a portion of the aether with them. The aether, close to their surfaces, is at rest relatively on those surfaces. 
- Its velocity changes as we recede from the surface, till, at no great distance, it is at rest in space. 

According to the undulatory theory, the direction in which a heavenly body is seen is normal to the fronts of the waves which have emanated from it, and which have reached the neighbourhood of the observer. The aether near him is at rest relatively to him.

- If the aether in space were at rest, the front of a wave of light at any instant being given, its front at any future time could be found by the method explained in Airy's Tracts.
- If the æther were in motion, and the speed of light were infinitely small, the wave's front would be displaced as a surface of particles of the æther. 

Neither of these suppositions are true because the aether moves while light goes through it. 

The displacements of a wave's front in an elementary portion of time due to the two causes just considered take place independently.

Let `u`, `v`, `w` be the resolved parts along the rectangular axes of `x`, `y`, `z` of the speed of the  aether-particle whose co-ordinates are `x`, `y`, `z`.

Let `V` be the speed of light supposing the æther at rest.

Because of the distance of the heavenly bodies, only the plane waves are considered, as they they are distorted by the æther's motion. 

Let the axis of `z` be taken in, or nearly in the direction of the wave considered, so that the equation to the wave's front at any time will be:

```elixir
z = C + VT + ζ (1.) 
```

- `C` is a constant
- `t` is the time
- `ζ` is a small quantity, a function of `x`, `y`, and `t`.

Since `u`, `v`, `w` and `ζ` are of the order of the aberration, their squares and products may be neglected.

Denoting by `a`, `B`, `y` the angles which the normal to the wave's front at the point (x, y, z) with the axes, we have, to the first order of approximation:

```elixir
cos a = - dζ / dz, cos B = - dζ / dy, cos y = 1 (2.)
```

If we take a length `Vdt` along this normal, the co-ordinates of its extremity will be:
    
```elixir
x - (dζ / dx) Vdt, y - (dζ / dy) Vdt, z + Vdt
```

<!-- z = C + VT + ζ
``` -->

If the aether were at rest, the locus of these extremities would be the wave's front at the time `t + dt`. But since it is in motion, the co-ordinates of those extremities must be further increased by udt, vdt, wdt. 


Denoting then by `x1, y1, z1,`  the co-ordinates of the point of the wave's front at 

α

positions. Hence equation (1.) becomes

whence, denoting by the suffixes 1, 2 the values of the variables belonging to the first and
second limits respectively, we obtain
(6.)


If the motion of the æther be such 

is an exact differential for one system of
rectangular axes, it is easy to prove, by the transformation of co-ordinates, that it is an exact
differential for any other system. Hence the formulae (6.) will hold good, not merely for light
propagated in the direction first considered, but for light propagated in any direction, the
direction of propagation being taken in each case for the axis of
. If we assume that
is an exact differential for that part of the motion of the æther which is due
to the motions of translation of the earth and planets, it does not therefore follow that the same
is true for that part which depends on their motions of rotation. Moreover, the diurnal aberration
is too small to be detected by observation, or at least to be measured with any accuracy, and I
shall therefore neglect it.
It is not difficult to show that the formulae (6.) lead to the known law of aberration. In applying
them to the case of a star, if we begin the integrations in equations (5.) at a point situated at
such a distance from the earth that the motion of the æther, and consequently the resulting
change in the direction of the light, is insensible, we shall have
moreover, we take the plane
and
; and if,
to pass through the direction of the earth's motion, we shall havethat is, the star will appear to be displaced towards the direction in which the earth is moving,
through an angle equal to the ratio of the velocity of the earth to that of light, multiplied by the
sine of the angle between the direction of the earth's motion and the line joining the earth and
the star.

In considering the effect of aberration on a planet, it will be convenient to divide the integrations in equation (5.) into three parts, first integrating from the point considered on the surface of the planet to a distance at which the motion of the æther may be neglected, then to a point near the earth where we may still neglect the motion of the æther, and lastly to the point of the earth's surface at which the planet is viewed. For the first part we shall have will be the resolved parts of the planet's velocity. 

The increments of interval will be, therefore,

For the second interval

being that through which a star in the direction of

displaced by aberration to an observer at , and the distance  being by hypothesis small (two
or three radii of the planet suppose), it follows that the angle is extremely small, and may be
neglected. Hence a planet will appear to be displaced from the position which it had when the
light left it, just as a star in the same direction is displaced. But besides this, the planet has
moved from
while the light has been travelling to
. These two considerations combined lead
to the formula for aberration, which is applicable to the planets, as is shown in treatises on
astronomy. The same reasoning which applies to a planet will apply equally to the sun, the
moon, or a comet.

To give an idea of the sort of magnitudes neglected in neglecting `pq`, suppose
- `pm` equal to the diameter of P
- the curvature from p to m uniform

- r be the radius of P

- R the distance PE

. Hence the angle

being the semidiameter must be very much greater for the moon than for any other body of the solar system; for in the case of the planets the value of is in no instance double its value for the earth or moon, while their discs are very small compared with that of the moon; and in the case of the sun, although its disc is about as large as that of the moon, its velocity round the centre of gravity of the solar system is very small. 

It would indeed be more correct to suppose the sun's centre absolutely at rest, since all our measurements are referred to it, and not to the centre of gravity of the solar system. 

Taking then the case of the moon, and supposing 
, we find that the angle is about
th of a second, an insensible quantity.


If the whole solar system were moving with a velocity comparable with that of the earth around the sun, then from the linearity of the equations employed, this motion can be considered separately. 

Regarding this motion, the sun, moon, and planets will come into the positions in which they are seen just at the instant that the light from them reaches the earth. 

With respect to the stars also, that part of the aberration which varies with the time of year, the only part which can be observed, will not be affected. 

If we suppose the æther which fills the portion of space occupied by the solar system to be moving in a current, with a velocity comparable with that of the earth in its orbit, the result will still be the same. 

For if we suppose a velocity equal and opposite to that of the æther to be impressed, both on the æther and on the bodies of the solar system, the case is reduced to that of the solar system moving through the æther supposed to be at rest.
