{{< s v="45" >}}  The situation mentioned above can help us to understand another fact, the cause of which was not known before, and the ignorance of this cause may hinder astrological predictions. 

There are periods of such a humid disposition in a man that cause bad mood without evident reason, when nothing pleasant can help him to escape from sad thoughts.

On the contrary, there are periods when a man is happy even without music. 

Similarly, I see that in accordance with aspects do exist other dispositions, stronger and of longer duration, which cause for instance a big humidity and cold during some period of lack of aspects, may it be the whole year. 

In such a year, we can observe that when even the slightest aspects occur, they provoke abundance of rains and cold, as it happened this year, 1601. 

On the contrary, during another year such a drought may happen, that in days when aspects occur, only a small clouds or fume appear instead of vapour, as it was in 1599.


{{< s v="46" >}}  I refrain from reflections upon the issue, what kind of manifestations of diversities come from eclipses of Sun and Moon. 

It could be, that the same vital capability or the soul of Earth, which I already mentioned many times, is strongly disturbed by the sudden loss of light, and that it is exposed to the influence of long duration, which Theophrast, who never made things up, probably have felt. If you decide to reject all physical causes and toassign this regular natural occurence to extraordinary God´s providence, you will not be able to explain, why
eclipses are so foreboding.

Paracelsus (born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541)


{{< s v="47" >}} The Earth reacts in the same way as living creatures do, regardless of their mortality.

The Earth has, due to some inner disposition, its period of humidity or something similar to a disease.

If so, the rules and intervals of such a period could be examined through comparison of many years´ observation, an observation which has not been done yet. 

Caesius attributes the influence to nineteen years long cycle of the Moon, which we cannot generally deny. The sailors also witness that the highest tides occur repeatedly every nineteen years and in the same days of the year, and that the Moon is predestined to rule over the humidity.

The Moon is capable of such an influence.

Jansenius Caesius (Willem Janzsoon Blaeu) 1571-1638, a disciple of Tycho Brahe
Nineteen years long period of the changes of declination of the Moon
The picture shows ten ninety-years long periods of changes of declination of the Moon in 190-years interval.


{{< s v="48" >}} The third cause also recommends itself for its great probability. 

Many disturbances in developments on the Earth, which I earlier declared to occur during an absence of aspects, may be caused by the fact that the
velocities of planets get into the harmonious ratio. 

In fact, should the adequate angle of rays have influence, why
not also the adequate velocity of motion of two stars, provided that velocities of their motion are in certain ratio,
thus one of them penetrates the same space faster and the other one slower in ratio of harmonious relationship.
These relationships are in fact very variable and do not occur too frequently, for the same planet is sometimes
faster, sometimes slower. But this third cause was neither confirmed by experience yet, nor any method has been
established for examination of harmonies of this kind.


{{< s v="49" >}}  There are many astrologers who seek the most impossible reasons for assigning the main dispositions of the year
by the ingres of the Sun to the sign of Aries, for the four seasons of the year by the ingres of the Sun to the
cardinal signs and of the Moon to the lunar stations, as if the time wouldn´t rather be a natural part of the motion
of heaven but some invariable subject, similar to a man whose natal chart we could examine with reason. As ifthe Earth would be born again in the moment of the new spring. The Earth does change by means of the aspects of the spring signs, should those occur, but not only for just one day, but also for previous and following days
because of another aspects which occur in that day.

There is nothing less inappropriate in this foolish effort of some astrologers than the fact, that with a kind of childish credulity, in spite of all opinions ad philosophical reasons, they distribute seven planets into 12 houses, assigning to them the dominances and temporary changes of rulership as in human relationships. This
causes all magical and astrological superstitions. Let´s admit that it may be appropriate to take into consideration
such a distribution of rulerships, as in case of Saturn, to which the winter signs are attributed, but this is ascribed
to other reasons. 

Regarding other planets, for instance Jupiter, this brings about false results.

This superficial part of astrology has been disproved upon physical basis some time ago by the astrologer
Stöffler (regardless the proof given by Pico della Mirandola, the enemy of astrology), and experience disproves
it day by day for centuries, because the exact day of the equinox was not known, as proved by Tycho Brahe.
Johannes Stöffler (Stöfler, Stoffler, Stoeffler) (12/10/1452 – 02/16/1531), German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer,
priest, producer of astronomical instruments and professor of the university of Tőbingen.
Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (02/24/1463-11/17/1494), Italian humanist and philosopher.
Yet some astrologers still mention the ingreses of the Sun into the cardinal signs in past years, and compare their
effects. I will show further on that they were wrong, and that they examined the horoscopes with similarly false
methods. I will prove that it is in contradiction with observed qualities in following years. 

In coming year (1602) the Sun will enter at sunset to the ascending sign of Aries on March 20th, while Jupiter will be in Libra; yet astrologers suppose, in accordance with Prussian tables, that the ascending sign will be Gemini.

Here Kepler points to the precession motion of the vernal point and to subsequent discrepancy of the old tables of starting
points of the signs with real positions according to new, more accurate measurements.
In that period, the main mission of astronomy was seen in drawing more and more accurate tables of motions of planets. In
1252, the so-called Alfonsian tables has been drawn, which originated in Ptolemaios´ Almagest. These bear the name of the
spanish king, Alfonso X. of Castile, who sponsored the project.

Reinhold Erasmus, 10/22/1511-02/19/1553, German astronomer, professor of higher mathematics on university of Wittenberg, has drawn astronomical tables based upon the heliocentric system of Copernicus. 

Prussian duke, Albert of Brandenburg, supported Reinhold and in 1551, he sponsored the print of his tables, in honour of the
duke called Prutenicae Tabulae, or Prussian tables of celestial motions. These tables were more accurate than the tables
derived from Almagest, but the fact that the system of Copernicus is based on circular motion of planets loaded the Prussian
tables with quite a sizeable error. An appropriate accuracy occurs later, in Rudolphian tables, named in honour of the
emperor Rudolf II, published by Kepler in 1627.
Sun entered the sign of Aries on March 20, 1602, at 21:20
Ingreses of Jupiter to signs:
08/14/1600 08:25:17 Jupiter enters Virgo
09/13/1601 16:36:12 Jupiter enters Libra
10/14/1602 07:05:41 Jupiter enters Scorpio
11/11/1603 03:32:56 Jupiter enters Saggitarius
12/02/1604 23:46:30 Jupiter enters Capricorn
For above mentioned reasons, no general meanings can be deducted from the ingres of the Sun to Aries. Jupiter
will show his power on April 8, when opposite to the Sun,
04/06/1602 – 04/08/1602 Sun in Aries in opposition to Jupiter in Libra
but on May 10-11, the influence of Saturn prevails over Jupiter´s, because on that day Saturn opposes the Sun.
05/08/1602 – 05/10/1602 Sun in Taurus in opposition to Saturn in Scorpio


{{< s v="50" >}} Nevertheless, I cannot refuse well-known observations neither of ancient authors – Hésiodos, Strates, Virgilius,
Plautos – nor those of modern peasants, who, having observed those phenomena, were able to predict the temperature of the air according to every year´s ascension of the stars and according to the phases of the Moon. 

They didn´t consider those observations to be magical omens of heaven, nor the cause of future developments
(diverse years have diverse omens), but just a mark of general earthly disposition, which is already present and
which will last for some time.
With regard to the laws ruling those time periods, I have to declare my unfamiliarity.

{{< s v="51" >}}  Moreover, it was recorded that this sequence of universal qualities is characterised by short periods. Thus the
peasants, who know this best, when they experienced hot summer, they expected very cold winter then. Andwhen an unnatural warmth continued during certain part of winter, they expected that the last part of winter will
be extraordinarily cold. Thus, at time when severe winter sets in very early, there will be, in turn, an early spring
in harmony with most of aspects which occur during this season.


{{< s v="52" >}}  By now, I have reviewed basic principles of astrological prediction, and what is left, I will describe in
predictions themselves. At first, in December, January and February a long term sextile between Mars and
Saturn will occur.

Graphic ephemeris for year 1602

Should Mars will be stationary during that period, and Saturn obviously slow, strong disturbances and major
excesses will occur in atmosphere. However, it is not easy to state how the excess will manifest itself. To
understand this, it would be necessary to undertake a thorough and convincing investigation of the state of
dispositions of Earth, but I could not understand the results of such an investigations by means of theories
actually valid. Those dispositions are stronger than the change of activity caused by planets themselves and their
special forces.

Should there were just and only this aspect (Mars sextile Saturn), I would predict extreme cold caused by lots of
snow, but due to the aggregation of other aspects, and mainly due to the position of Mars which becomes
stationary, I think such disturbances will occur that the air will be warmed up by hot evaporations coming from
inside of Earth, so the snow will be melting and the roads will render impassable to a great extent.
On January 4, conjunction of Sun and Mercury points to the snow and wind, depending on to which extent the
general disposition will permit. On January 10 and 11, six very strong aspects will occur, the warmth and rain
will mix up with snow.

Towards the end of the month, the old aspects will weaken, whereas the new aspect, a quintile between Jupiter
and Venus on January 21, will cause windy and warm weather, as much as the winter will allow.
On January 24, a quintile between Saturn and Sun will cause cold weather with snow or rain.
On January 28, a sesquiquartile of Mars and Sun will occur; it indicates sharp winter with blasts of strong wind
and snow according to common condition. Therefore, those who intend to investigate new aspects should pay
attention to those days.Further on, we show exact constellations for particular months, which can differ from those of Kepler.

{{< s v="53" >}} Many old and new aspects will occur in February.

Conjunction Venus/Mercury, in principle, brings about atmospherical disturbances. As stated above, the nature
of these planets is in contrast with the nature of Saturn and Mars.
The contrast may be enhanced by the fact that the distance of Venus and Mercury, who have almost the same
course, grows very slowly, and therefore their influence is of big effect.
Surely the storms can also occur. From February 11 to 23, there will be no calm days. Thus, it will either snow a
great deal, when winter will come back on February 11 together with square between Saturn and Sun, or it will
rain a lot, if, as I rather believe, the warm weather continues.

{{< s v="54" >}} In February, there are twenty-one aspects between six planets, and there´s no reason to include the Moon aspects, as they change very quickly. In March, there are twenty aspects, which means that the weather will be much more tempestuous, restless and turbulent than heretofore, although it is quite unusual. During the first part
of the month, thunderstorms will occur due to opposition Sun/Mars, and although due to the latitude of Mars the power would decrease, on the other side will be enhanced by the frequence of aspects. 

Therefore, I predict the change from hitherto unnatural warmth to the cold of winter on March 13; cold wind and snow with rain will
follow. According to our calculations, February has 19 and March 22 aspects; the total sum fits perfectly.

{{< s v="55" >}} I expect standard April, with the warm on the beginning caused by biquintile Mars/Sun, with rain approximately
two days before and two days after Full Moon (04/06/1602), as at that time all planets are in aspects.
The rain will continue also from April 13 to16. There will be warm then after, and on April 24, after the trine
Sun/Mars, will get extraordinarily much warmer, and it will cause thunderstorms. At the end of the month,
precipitations will occur again.

In May, weather will be unpleasant, and the storms will occur during the first days of May due to the conjunction Venus/Mercury, provided that the power of this aspect will not be weakened by different latitude, which is not certain yet, inasmuch as not even the days are certain, because the calculation of Mercury´s position is not still quite accurate.

On May 10, 11 and 12, there will be cold rain, maybe snow in mountains, and unhealthy air. Should the sky will be clear, white frost also can occur. Then, a beautiful, calm and wet weather will follow, because besides the old aspects, there is one new quintile Saturn/Mars. By the end of the month, storms and precipitations will occur.
