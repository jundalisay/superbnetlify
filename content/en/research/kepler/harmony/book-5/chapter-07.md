Now there is need, Urania,*”” of a grander sound, while I ascend by the harmonic stair of the celestial motions to higher things, where the true archetype of the fabric of the world is laid up and preserved.


Follow me, modern musicians, and attribute it to your arts, unknown to antiquity: in these last centuries, Nature, always prodigal of herself, has at last brought forth, after an incubation of twice a thousand years, you, the first true offprints of the universal whole.*

By your harmonizing of various voices, and through your ears, she has whispered of herself, as she is in her innermost bosom, to the human mind, most beloved daughter of God the Creator.

What harmonic proportions the pairs of neighboring planets embraced at the extremities of their motions has Shall 1 be committing a crime if I demand some been expounded above. However, it happens very ingenious motet from individual composers of this age for this declaration? 

The royal psalter"’rarely that the two, especially the slowest, reach and the other sacred books will be able to supply
their extreme intervals at the same time. For ex­ a suitable text for it. Yet take note that no more

by.**® Yet the leap which concludes the eighth 

century does not come precisely to the actual apsides; and if it should
be a little further out of place, another eight hundred years must be
awaited, to make it reasonably possible to look for a leap which will
be more fortunate than the former one, and that must be repeated
as often as the measure of the error is contained within the extent
of half a single leap. The other individual pairs also produce such
periods, though not so extensive. In the meantime, however, other har­
monies of pairs of planets occur, which are not between motions which
are both extreme; but with an intermediate motion, either one or both,
and those at different tunings, so to speak. For as Saturn is extended
from G to and a little further, and Jupiter from io d and beyond,
therefore, the following harmonies at a diapason above can occur be­
tween Saturn and Jupiter; either of the thirds, and a diatessaron."'*
Of the thirds indeed, either one can occur through a tuning which
covers the extent of the other; whereas the diatessaron can occur over
the extent of a major tone."^ For there will be a diatessaron not only
from the G of Saturn to the cc of Jupiter but also from the A of Saturn
to the dd of Jupiter, and over all the intermediate notes from the G
and A of the former to the cc and dd of the latter."® However, the
diapason and diapente occur only at the apsidal points. However, Mars
which takes a larger interval of its own has acquired the feature that
it also makes a diapason with the superior planets, by a certain lati­
tude of tuning."’ Mercury has occupied an interval o f a size such that
it generally sets up all harmonies with all planets, within one of its
own periods, which is not more extensive than the space of three
months. The Earth, on the contrary, and Venus much more, on account
of the narrowness of their own intervals, restrict their harmonies not
only with the other planets, but most of all their mutual harmonies
with each other, to a remarkably small number. But if three planets
must combine together into a single harmony, many alternations must
be awaited. However, there are many harmonies, so that they occur
all the more easily, when all the nearest planets catch their neighbors;
and triple harmonies between Mars, the Earth and Mercury seem to
occur rather often. However, harmonies of four planets now begin
to be scattered over centuries, and those of five planets over myriads
of years. However, an agreement together of all six is hedged about
by very long gaps of ages; and I do not know whether it is altogether impossible for it to occur twice, by a precise rotation, and it rather
Character of the

age of the world has descended."*
But if there could occur one single sixfold harmony, or one out­
standing one among several, that undoubtedly could be taken as char­
acterizing the Creation.
We must therefore enquire whether and in how many patterns
altogether the motions of all the six planets are combined into one
common harmony? The method of enquiry is to begin from the Earth
and Venus, as these two do not make more than two consonances, and
those (which contains the cause of this phenomenon) through very
brief coincidences of the motions.
Come, therefore, let us first set up two, so to speak, skeletons of
the harmonies, individually bounded by the pairs of extreme num­
bers (by which the terms of the tunings are represented), and let us
set out to find what agrees with them out of the variety of motions
permitted to each planet. Let the first skeleton have as the proportion
between the Earth and Venus 3:5, and at the lowest tuning the daily
motion of the Earth at aphelion, 57 minutes 3 seconds, at the highest
tuning the motion of Venus at perihelion, 97 minutes 37 seconds."^
Therefore, the rest will be as follows. [See page 444.]
Therefore, the second skeleton will be one in which between the
Earth and Venus there is another possible harmony, 5:8. In this case
of the daily motion of Venus at aphelion, 94 minutes 50 seconds, one
eighth part, 11 minutes 51 seconds + , taken five times, matches the
motion of the Earth, 59 minutes 16 seconds, and a similar fraction
of the motion of Venus at perihelion, 97 minutes 37 seconds, matches
the motion of the Earth, 61 minutes 1 second. Therefore, the rest of
the planets are in harmony with the following daily motions. [See
page 445.]
Therefore, the experience of astronomy bears witness that univer­
sal harmonies of all the motions can occur, and both kinds, hard and
soft; and in each kind in twofold shape or (if the term is permissible)
tone; and in any one of four situations, with some latitude of tuning,
and also with some variety in the particular harmonies of Saturn, Mars,
and Mercury, each with the rest. Nor is it evinced only in the inter­
mediate motions, but in absolutely all the extreme motions, except for those of Mars at aphelion and of Jupiter at perihelion; for since
the former occupies/g and the latter d, Venus which perpetually oc­
cupies the intermediate dQ or e does not allow those dissonant neigh­
bors in the universal harmony, which it would do if it had been granted
room to go beyond e or dg. This is the impediment which the mar­
riage of the Earth and Venus has, as male and female, and they are
the two planets which distinguish the kinds of harmonies, that is to
say into hard and masculine, and soft and feminine. It is as if one of
the spouses has done a favor to the other, that is to say the Earth is
either at his aphelion, preserving, so to speak, his marital authority,
and pressing on with tasks which are worthy of a man, pushing aside
and banishing Venus to her perihelion as if to her distaff; or he has
courteously allowed her to ascend towards her aphelion, or the Earth
himself has descended towards his perihelion in the direction of Venus,
and of her embraces, so to speak, so as to make love, laying aside for
a little while his shield and arms, and those tasks which are proper
for a man; for then the harmony is soft.
But if we command this antagonistic lady, Venus, to be silent, that
is, if we consider what harmonies there can be, not of all the planets,
but at least of the remaining five, excluding the motion of Venus, the
Earth indeed is still astray on his note g, and does not ascend more
than a semitone from it. Therefore, b, !^, c, d, dg, and e can still agree
with g, in which case Jupiter, as you see, representing the note d by
its motion at perihelion, is admitted. The difficulty of the motion of
Mars at aphelion therefore remains. For the motion of the Earth at
aphelion, which occupies^, does not allow Mars on fg , whereas at peri­
helion, as has been stated above in Chapter V, it shrinks from agree­
ment with the motion of Mars at aphelion by about half a diesis. [See
page 447.]
However, there can also be the following harmony of the four planets
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, which would also include the mo­
tion of Mars at aphelion; but it has no latitude of tuning.’^s [See chart,
page 448.]
Therefore, the motions of the heavens are nothing but a kind of
perennial harmony (in thought not in sound'^^) through dissonant
tunings, like certain syncopations or cadences (by which men imitate
those natural dissonances), and tending towards definite and prescribed
resolutions, individual to the six terms (as with vocal parts) and mark­
ing and distinguishing by those notes the immensity of time. Thus
it is no longer surprising that Man, aping his Creator, has at last found

a method of singing in harmony which was unknown to the ancients,
so that he might play, that is to say, the perpetuity of the whole of
cosmic time in some brief fraction of an hour, by the artificial concert
of several voices, and taste up to a point the satisfaction of God his
Maker in His works by a most delightful sense of pleasure felt in this
imitator of God, Music.
