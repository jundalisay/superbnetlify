Proclus Diadochus, Commentaries on Euclid I, Book

{{< q >}}
The use of mathematics in Natural Philosophy and Politics most of all concerns the Harmonic part of it on radiations.

It furnishes everything that is important for the contemplation of nature. It declares the most splendid order of the ratios, according to which the whole of this universe has been constructed.

Timaeus says that the analogy of the proportions connects together everything in the world. It restores the friendship between things which are in conflict, and relations and mutual affection between those which are widely separated.

Hence it is also possible to hunt out by logical thinking the appropriate pattern of angles.

I think this is also what Timaeus meant when he everywhere describes his reflections on the nature of the whole universe in mathematical terms, depicts the origin of the elements in numbers and figures, and states that their powers and properties, and their effects, were taken from these {figures), the acute and obtuse among the angles, and the rough and smooth among the sides, and so forth, establishing the causes of all kinds of mutations.

In the study of Politics, mathematics confers very many remarkable benefits, as it measures out the proper occasions for conducting affairs, and the various revolutions in the whole of the universe, etc., and the Harmonic Numbers, which control life or are responsible for incongruence, and universally give support to hastening or slackening of motions, etc
