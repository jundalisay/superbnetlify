description: "Kepler worked with Galileo to prove the heliocentric model of the universe. Like Pythagoras and Socrates, he viewed the universe as a harmony of music which he expressed in geometric shapes. His work combined astronomy and astrology. This makes him one of the foundations for Material Superphysics which can cross over to Social and Bio Superphysics, through the effect of stars on the behavior of life-forms such as humans and viruses (semi-lifeforms). This is different from current astronomy which is totally separated and unrelated to society or health"
