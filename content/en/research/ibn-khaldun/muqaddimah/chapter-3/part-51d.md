In his Kitab as-Sunan, Ibn Majah published the following tradition of Abdallah b. Masud through Yazid b. Abi Ziyad, 884 on the authority of Ibrahim, <!-- 885 --> on the authority of 'Algamah, 886 on the authority of 'Abdallah, who said= "While we
were with the Messenger of God, there came some Hashimite youths. 

When he saw them, tears welled forth from his eyes and his color changed." He said= "I said= 'For  some time now we have observed something in your face we do not like.' He answered= 'For us, the people of the House, God has chosen the other world instead of this one. 

After me, my people will experience misfortune, exile, and banishment, until people shall come from the East with black flags. They will ask for goodnessbut they will not be given it. They will fight and they will be victorious. And they
will be given what they had asked for, but they will not accept it. 

Eventually, they will hand (the earth) over to a man of my family. He will fill it with equity, as they
had filled it with injustice. Those among you who live to see that happen shall go to
them, even if it is necessary to creep over the snow.' " End of the quotation.
The hadith transmitters know this tradition as "the tradition of the flags." Its
transmitter is Yazid b. Abi Ziyad. 

Shu'bah said regarding him= "He was a person who traced back to Muhammad traditions that are not known to have been
transmitted with a chain of transmitters going back to him." Muhammad b. Fudayl
887 said= "He is one of the great religious leaders of the Shi'ah." Ahmad b. Hanbal
said= "He was no hadith expert." 

Once he said= "He is not such (a good man)." 

Yahya b. Main said= "He is weak." Al-'Ijli said= "His traditions are permissible. At
the end, he used to understand things." Abu Zur'ah 888 said= "He is soft. 889 His
traditions may be written down, but they cannot be used as evidence." Abu Hatim
said= "He is not strong." Al-Juzajant said= "I heard them declare his traditions weak."
Abu Dawad said= "I do not know anyone who omitted his traditions, but I like others
better than him." Ibn 'Adi said= "He belongs to the Shi'ah of al-Kilfah. In spite of his
weakness, his traditions may be written down." 890 Muslim transmitted traditions of
his but only when the same traditions were also transmitted with other chains of
transmitters. In general, the majority considered him weak. Religious leaders have
pronounced openly on the weakness of the tradition of the flags that was transmitted
by him on the authority of Ibrahim, on the authority of 'Alqamah, on the authority of
'Abdallah. Waki' b. al-Jarrah 891 said regarding it= "It is nothing." The same was said
by Ahmad b. Hanbal. Abu Qudamah 892 said= "I heard Abu Usamah 893 say,
regarding Yazid's tradition about the flags on the authority of Ibrahim= 'Were he to
swear me fifty oaths, I should not believe him. Is that Ibrahim's way? Is that
'Algamah's way? Is that 'Abdallah's way?' " 

Al the Du'afd' (on weak transmitters). Adh-Dhahabi said= "It is not sound." 894

The following tradition of 'Ali was published by Ibn Majah, as transmitted by Yasin al-'Ijli, 8 95 on the authority of Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyah, 8 96 on the authority of Ibrahim's father, on the authority of his grandfather ('Ali), who said: 

"The Messenger of God said= 'The Mahdi is from among us, the people of the
House. God will give him success in one night.' "

Although Ibn Ma'in said, regarding Yasin al-'Ijli, that there was nothing wrong with him, al-Bukhari said that he was disputed. 897 In al-Bukhari's terminology, that is a strong expression for declaring a transmitter weak. The
tradition of Yasin was quoted by Ibn 'Adi in the Kamil and by adhDhahabl in the
Mizdn, with disapproval. 

Adh-Dhahabi said= "It is known as his (tradition)." <!-- 898 -->

The following tradition of 'Ali was published by atTabarani in his Medium Mu`jam:
" 'All said to the Messenger of God= 'Will the Mahdi be from among us or from
among other people, O Messenger of God?' Muhammad replied= 'Indeed, he will be
from among us. Through us, God will bring about the end, as he brought about the
beginning. Through us, they shall be saved from polytheism, and through us, God
shall unite them after open hostilities, as he united them through us after the
hostilities of polytheism.


Ali said: 'Will they be believers or unbelievers?' 

Muhammad replied: 'Rebel(s) and unbeliever(s).' " End of the quotation.

The chain of transmitters of this tradition includes 'Abdallah b. Lahi'ah. 899

He is weak, and it is well known what the matter is with him. (The same chain) also
includes 'Amr b. Jabir al-Hadrami.900 He is even weaker than Ibn Lahi'ah. Ahmad
b. Hanbal said= "He ('Amr b. Jabir) transmitted disapproved things on the authorityof Jabir. 901 I have heard that he used to lie." An-Nasa'i said= "He is not reliable."

Ibn Lahi'ah said= "He was a stupid, weak-minded shaykh. He used to say= "Ali is in
the clouds.' He was sitting with us, and when he saw a cloud, he would say= 'There
goes 'Ali passing by in a cloud.' " <!-- 902 -->

Another tradition of 'Ali was also published by at-Tabarani= "The Messenger
of God said= 'At the end of time, there will be a rebellion in which people will be
caught as firmly as gold is embedded in the ore. Do not slander the Syrians, but only
the bad ones among them, because among them there are (also) saints. 903 Soon a
downpour will be sent from heaven upon the Syrians. It will divide them so much
that if nothing (stronger) than foxes were going to fight them, they would be
defeated. At that time, there will come forth one from among my family and there
will be with him three flags (regiments), comprising, according to the highest figure
given, fifteen thousand men, or, according to the lowest figure, twelve thousand
men. Their order of the day will be= Kill, kill. They will encounter seven flags (regi-
ments), each of which will be commanded by a man who seeks royal authority. But
God will kill all of them. He will restore to the Muslims their unity, prosperity,
remote (possessions), and judgment.' " End of the quotation.
The chain of transmitters of that tradition includes 'Abdallah b. Lahi'ah. He is
weak, and it is well known what the matter is with him. (The tradition) was
transmitted by al-Hakim in his Mustadrak. He said= "It is sound with regard to the
chain of transmitters, but (al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not publish it." (Al-Hakim's)
recension has= ". . . Then, there will appear the Hashimite, and God will restore to
the people their unity, etc." (AI-Hakim's) chain of transmitters does not include Ibn
Lahi'ah. It is, as he states, a sound chain.

The following tradition of 'Ali was published by alHakim in the Mustadrak, as transmitted by Abu t-Tufayl, on the authority of Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyah, who said= "We were with 'Ali, and someone asked him about the Mahdi. 'Ali
replied= 'Look here.' 

Then he made a seven with his fingers and said= 'He is the one who will come forth at the end of time. When someone says (at that time)= God, God! he will be killed. 

God will gather for him people who are scattered like stray clouds. He will unite them. They will be neither sad nor glad over anyone who joins them. In number they will be like the fighters at Badr, whom men of former times
did not surpass and men of later times fell short of. They will also be like the
number of the companions of Saul who crossed the river with him.' " 904 Abu t-
Tufayl said: "Ibn al-Hanafiyah said= 'Do you want (to hear) it?' I said= 'Yes.' (So) he
continued: 'He will come forth between these two mountains.' 905 I said= 'By God, I
shall assuredly not leave them until I die.' "-And he died in it, that is, Mecca.

Al-Hakim said: "This is a sound tradition according to the conditions (for sound traditions) laid down by (alBukhari and Muslim)." End of the quotation.

However, it is (sound) only according to the conditions laid down by Muslim, for in (the chain of transmitters) there occur the names of 'Ammar ad-Duhni 906 and Yunus b. Abi Ishaq.907 Al-Bukhari did not publish any traditions of these
two men. 

It also includes 'Amr b. Muhammad al-'Angazi. 908 Al-Bukhari did not
publish traditions of his as evidence, though he did publish them to support the
reliability of traditions. In addition, there also is the pro-Shl'ah sentiment of 'Ammar
ad-Duhni. Although Ahmad (b. Hanbal), Ibn Ma'in, Abu Hatim, an-Nasa'i, and
others considered him reliable, 'Ali b. al-Madini 909 said on the authority of Sufyan
910 that Bishr b. Marwan 911 had disqualified him. "In what respect?" I (Sufyan)
asked. He replied= "In respect to his pro-Shi'ah sentiment."The following tradition of Anas b. Malik was published by Ibn Majah, as transmitted by Sa'd b. 'Abd-al-Hamid b. Ja'far,912 on the authority of 'Ali b. Ziyad
al-Yamami, 913 on the authority of 'Ikrimah b. 'Ammar,914 on the authority of Ishaq
b. 'Abdallah,915 on the authority of Anas, who said= "I heard the Messenger of God
say= 'We, the descendants of 'Abd-al-Muttalib, are the lords of the inhabitants of
Paradise. I, Hamzah, 'Ali, Jafar, al-Hasan, al-Husayn, and the Mahdi.' " 916 End of
the quotation.
