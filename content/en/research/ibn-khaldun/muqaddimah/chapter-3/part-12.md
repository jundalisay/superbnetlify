## 12. Dynasties have a natural life span like individuals

Physicians and astrologers believe that the natural human life span is 120 years. 

<!-- Within the same generation, the duration of life differs according to the conjunctions. It may be more or less than 120 years. 
The life (span) of persons who are under some particular
conjunction will be a full hundred years. Of others, it will be fifty, or eighty, or
seventy years, accordingly as the indications of conjunctions noted by these
observers may require.  -->

The life of a Muslim lasts between 60-70 years. This is stated in the hadith. <!-- The natural life span of one hundred and twenty years
is surpassed only on the occasion of rare configurations and extraordinary positions
on the firmament. Such was the case with Noah and with a few (individuals) among
the peoples of 'Ad and Thamud. -->

Simlarly, dynasties have a lifespan which differ according to the conjunctions. However, as a rule, no dynasty lasts beyond  three generations. A generation is identical with the average lifespan of a person or 40 years -- the time required for growth
to be completed and maturity reached. 

God said= "Until when he reaches his maturity and reaches the age of forty years...." 76 

Therefore, the average lifespan of an individual is identical with the duration of a generation. This is confirmed by the significance of the 40 year sojourn of the Israelites in the desert. That span was intended to disappear the generation then alive and the growth of another generation, (one) that had not witnessed and felt the humiliation (in Egypt). 

This is proof of the assumption that (a period of) forty years, which is identical with the (average) life of a single individual, must be considered the duration of a generation.

The first generation retains the desert qualities, desert toughness, and desert savagery. Its members are used to privation and to sharing their glory with each other. They are brave and rapacious. The strength of group feeling continues to be preserved among them. They are sharp and greatly feared. People submit to them.

Under the influence of royal authority and a life of ease, the second generation changes from the desert attitude to sedentary culture, from privation to luxury and plenty, from a state in which everybody shared in the glory to one in
which one man claims all the glory for himself while the others are too lazy to strive for (glory), and from proud superiority to humble subservience. 

Thus, the vigor of group feeling is broken to some extent. People become used to lowliness and obedience. But many of (the old virtues) remain in them, because they had had direct personal contact with the first generation and its conditions, and had observed with their own eyes its prowess and striving for glory and its intention to protect and defend (itself). 

They cannot give all of it up at once, although a good deal of it maygo. They live in hope that the conditions that existed in the first generation may come back, or they live under the illusion that those conditions still exist.

The third generation, then, has completely forgotten the period of desert life and toughness, as if it had never existed. They have lost (the taste for) the sweetness of fame and (for) group feeling, because they are dominated by force.

Luxury reaches its peak among them, because they are so much given to a life of prosperity and ease. They become dependent on the dynasty and are like women and children who need to be defended (by someone else). Group feeling disappears
completely. People forget to protect and defend themselves and to press their claims. 

With their emblems, apparel, horseback riding, and (fighting) skill, 79 they deceive people and give them the wrong impression. For the most part, they are more cowardly than women upon their backs. When someone comes and demands something from them, they cannot repel him. 

The ruler, then, has need of other, brave people for his support. He takes many clients and followers. They help the dynasty to some degree, until God permits it to be destroyed, and it goes with everything it stands for.

As one can see, we have there three generations. In the course of these three generations, the dynasty grows senile and is worn out. Therefore, it is in the fourth generation that (ancestral) prestige is destroyed. This was stated before in connection
with (the subject) that glory and (ancestral) prestige are restricted to four generations. 80 

<!-- We have proved it with natural and evident arguments based on premises that we established before. The reader should consider that. As an impartial person, he should not disregard the truth. -->

Three generations last 120 years. As a rule, dynasties do not last longer than that many years, a few more or a few less,
save when, by chance, no one appears to attack (the dynasty). 

When senility becomes preponderant (in a dynasty), there may be no claimant (for its power, and then nothing will happen), but if there should be one, he will encounter no one capable of repelling him. If the time is up, (the end of the dynasty) cannot be
postponed for a single hour, no more than it can be accelerated.

In this way, the lifespan of a dynasty corresponds to the lifespan of an individual; it grows up and passes into an age of stagnation and thence into retrogression. 

Therefore, people commonly say that the life (span) of a dynasty is one hundred years. The saying means the same as what (I have just explained). 

One should consider this and derive from it a rule for finding the correct number of ancestors in a pedigree, if one is uncertain about it but knows the time interval that the pedigree covers. 

For every 100 years, one should figure three ancestors. If the result tallies with the total number of (ancestors indicated in the pedigree, it) is correct. If it is one generation short, there must be an error in the number of (ancestors indicated in the pedigree, and) there must be one (ancestor) too many in it. 

If (the result) indicates one generation too many, one (ancestor) must have been omitted (from the pedigree). In the same way, one may figure out the number of years, if one knows the correct number of ancestors 82
