Many jurists and muftis have undertaken to refute these and similar statements by recent Sufis. They summarily disapproved of everything they came across in the (Sufi) path. 

The truth is that discussion with the (Sufis) requires making a distinction. The Sufis discuss 4 topics:

1. Pious exertions

These cause mystical and ecstatic experiences, and - self-scrutiny concerning (one's) actions.

They discuss these things in order to obtain mystical experiences, which then become a station from which one progresses to the next higher one, as we have stated. <!-- 539  -->

2. The removal of the veil and the perceivable supernatural realities, such as the divine attributes, the (divine) throne, the (divine) seat, the angels, revelation, prophecy, the spirit, and the realities of everything in existence, be it supernatural or visible. 

They discuss the order of created
things, how they issue from the Creator Who brings them into being, as mentioned
before. <!-- 540 -->

3. The activities in the various worlds and among the various created things connected with different kinds of acts of divine
grace. 

4. Expressions that are suspect (if understood) in their plain meaning. Such (expressions) have been uttered by most
Sufi leaders. 

In Sufi technical terminology, they are called "ecstatic utterances" (shatahat). <!-- 541 --> Their plain meaning is difficult to understand. 

They may be something that must be disapproved of, or something that can be approved, or something that requires interpretation.

As for their discussion of pious exertions and stations, of the mystical and ecstatic experiences that result, and of self-scrutiny with regard to (possible)
shortcomings in the things that cause these (experiences), this is something that
nobody ought to reject. These mystical experiences of (the Sufis) are sound ones.
Their realization is the very essence of happiness. 542

As for their discussion of the acts of divine grace experienced by Sufis, the
information they give about supernatural things, and their activity among the created
things, these (also) are sound and cannot be. disapproved of, even though some
religious scholars tend to disapprove. That is not right. Professor Abu Ishaq al-
Isfarayini, a leading Ash'arite, argued that these things should be disapproved of,
since they might be confused with the (prophetical) miracles. However, competent
orthodox scholars have made a distinction between (miracles and acts of divine
grace) by referring to "the (advance) challenge" (tahaddi), 543 that is, the claim
(made by a prophet in advance) that the miracle would occur in agreement with the
prophetic revelation. It is not possible, they said, that a miracle could happen in
agreement with the claim of a liar. Logic requires that a miracle indicate
truthfulness. By definition, a (miracle is something that) can be verified.

If it were
performed by a liar, it (could not be verified, and thus) would have changed its
character, which is absurd. In addition, the world of existence attests the occurrence
of many such acts of divine grace. Disapproval of them would be a kind of negative
approach. Many such acts of divine grace were experienced by the men around
Muhammad and the great early Muslims. This is a well-known and famous (fact).
Most of the (Sufi) discussion of the removal (of the veil), of the reception of
the realities of the higher things, and of the order in which the created things issue,
falls, in a way, under the category of ambiguous statements. 544 It is based upon the
intuitive experience of (Sufis), and those who lack such intuitive experience cannot
have the mystical experience that the (Sufis receive from) it. No language can
express the things that (Sufis) want to say in this connection, because languages
have been invented only for (the expression of) commonly accepted concepts, most
of which apply to the sensibilia. 545 Therefore, we must not bother with the (Sufi)
discussion of those matters. We ought merely to leave it alone, just as we leave
alone the ambiguous statements (of the Qur'an and the Sunnah). 546 Those to whom
God grants some understanding of those (mystical) utterances in a way that agrees
with the plain meaning of the religious law do, indeed, enjoy happiness.
(Finally,) there are the suspect expressions which the Sufis call "ecstatic
utterances" (shatahat) and which provoke the censure of orthodox Muslims. As to
them, it should be known that the attitude that would be fair to the (Sufis) is (to
observe) that they are people who are removed from sense perception. Inspiration
grips them. Eventually, they say things about their inspiration that they do not intendto say. A person who is removed (from sense perception) cannot be spoken to. 

He who is forced (to act) is excused (when he acts, no matter what he does). (Sufis) who are known for their excellence and exemplary character are considered to act in good faith in this and similar respects. It is difficult to express ecstatic experiences, because there are no conventional ways of expressing them. This was the experience
of Abu Yazid al-Bistami 547 and others like him. 

However, Sufis whose excellence is not known and famous deserve censure for utterances of this kind,
since the (data) that might cause us to interpret their statements (so as to remove any
suspicion attached to them) are not clear to us. (Furthermore, any Sufis) who are not
removed from sense perception and are not in the grip of a state when they make
utterances of this kind, also deserve censure. Therefore, the jurists and the great
Sufis decided that al-Hallaj 548 was to be killed, because he spoke (ecstatically)
while not removed (from sense perception) but in control of his state. And God
knows better.

The early Sufis who are mentioned in (al-Qushayri's) Risalah, 549 those
outstanding Muslims to whom we have referred above, had no desire to remove the
veil and to have such. (supernatural) perception. Their concern was to follow their
models and to lead an exemplary life as far as possible. Whenever they had a
(supernatural) experience, they turned away from it and paid no attention to it.
Indeed, they tried to avoid it.550 They were of the opinion that it was an obstacle
and a tribulation and belonged to the (ordinary) perceptions of the soul, and, as
such, was something created. They also thought that human perception could not
comprise all the existentia and that the knowledge of God was wider, His creation
greater, and His religious law more certain for guidance (than any mystical
experience).551 Therefore, they did not speak about any of their (supernatural)
perceptions.

In fact, they forbade the discussion of those things and prevented their companions, for whom the veil (of sense perception) was removed, from discussing the matter or from giving it the slightest consideration. They continued following their models and leading exemplary lives as they had done in the world of sensual perception before the removal (of the veil), and they commanded their companions to do the same.552 Such ought to be the state of the Sufi novice.
