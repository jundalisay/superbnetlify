These are sciences showing how human souls may become prepared to exercise an influence upon the world of the elements, either without any aid or with the aid of celestial matters. 

1. The first kind is sorcery
2. The second kind is talismans

These sciences are forbidden by the religious laws because they are harmful and require (their practitioners) to direct themselves to (beings) other than God, such as stars and other things. 

Therefore, books dealing with them are almost nonexistent among the people. 

The only exceptions are the books of the ancient nations from before the time of Moses' prophecy, such as the Nabataeans
and the Chaldeans. None of the prophets who preceded (Moses) made or brought any laws. Their books were concerned with exhortations, with the recognition of the oneness of God, and with references to Paradise and Hell 7 46

The magical sciences were cultivated among the Syrian and Chaldean inhabitants of Babel and among the Copts of Egypt, and others. They composed books dealing with them and left information (concerning their occupation with them. 

Only very few of their books have been translated for us. (One book that was translated), for instance, is the Falahah anNabatiyah, <!-- 747 --> a Babylonian work. 

People learned the science of sorcery from that work and developed its manifold branches.

Later on, other works on sorcery were composed. Among such works were the Books (Masahif) of the Seven Stars and the book of  Tumtum the Indian 748 on the Figures of the Degrees (of the Signs of the Zodiac) and the Stars, and (works by) other (authors). Later on, Jabir b. Hayyan, 749 the chief sorcerer of Islam, appeared in the East. 

He scrutinized the scholarly books and discovered the Art (the craft of sorcery and alchemy). He studied its essence and brought it out. He wrote a number of works on (sorcery). He lengthily discussed both sorcery and the craft of alchemy
which goes together with sorcery, because the transformation of specific bodies (substances) from one form into another is effected by psychic powers, and not by a practical technique. Thus it is a sort of sorcery, as we shall mention in the proper
place.750 

Then, Maslamah b. Ahmad al-Majriti, 751 the leading Spanish scholar in the mathematical (scientific) and magical sciences, made his appearance. He abridged all these books and corrected them and collected all their different approaches in his
Ghayat al-hakim. Nobody has written on this science since.

Let us present here some prefatory remarks that will explain the real meaning of sorcery. It is as follows. Human souls are one in species. However, they differ in view of their particular qualities. 752 They are of different kinds. Each kind is distinguished by a particular quality which does not exist in any other kind (of soul).

These qualities come to constitute a natural disposition belonging (exclusively) to its particular kind (of soul).
The souls of the prophets have a particular quality through which they are prepared 753 to have divine knowledge, to be addressed by the angels in the name of God, as has been mentioned before, 754 and to exercise the influence upon created
beings that goes with all that.The souls of certain sorcerers also have the quality (of being able) to exercise
influence upon created beings and to attract the spirituality of the stars, so that they
can use it for being active (among created beings) and be able to exercise an influence through either a psychic or a Satanic power. Now, the prophets are able to exercise their influence with the help of God and by means of a divine quality. 

The souls of soothsayers, on the other hand, have a quality enabling them to observe supernatural things by means of Satanic powers. Thus, every kind (of soul) is distinguished by (its) particular quality, which does not exist in any other kind.
The souls that have magical ability are of three degrees. These three degrees
will now be explained here. 

The first (kind) exercises its influence merely through mental power, without any instrument or aid. This is what the philosophers call sorcery. The second (kind) exercises its influence with the aid of the temper of the spheres and the elements, or with the aid of the properties of numbers. This is called talismans. It is weaker in degree than the first (kind).

The third (kind) exercises its influence upon the powers of imagination. The person who exercises this kind of influence relies upon the powers of imagination. He is somehow active in them. He plants among them different sorts of phantasms,
images, and pictures, whichever he intends to use. Then, he brings them down to the level of the sensual perception of the observers with the help of the power of his soul that exercises an influence over that (sensual perception). As a result, the
(phantasms, etc.) appear to the observers to exist in the external world, while, in fact, there is nothing (of the sort). For instance, a person is said to have seen gardens, rivers, and castles, while, in fact, there was nothing of the sort. This is what the philosophers call "prestidigitation" (sha'wadhah or sha'badhah).

Those are the different degrees of (sorcery).

The sorcerer possesses his particular quality in potentiality, as is the case with all human powers. It is transformed (from potentiality) into actuality by exercise. All magical exercise consists of directing oneself to the spheres, the stars,
the higher worlds, or to the devils by means of various kinds of veneration and worship and submissiveness and humiliation. Thus, magical exercise is devotion and adoration directed to (beings) other than God. 

Such devotion is unbelief. Therefore, sorcery is unbelief, or unbelief forms part of the substance and motives of sorcery,
as has been seen. Consequently, (sorcerers must be killed). Jurists differ (only) as to
whether they must be killed because of the unbelief which is antecedent to the
practice (of sorcery), or because of their corrupting activity and the resulting
corruption of created beings. 

All this comes from (sorcerers and sorcery). Furthermore, since the first two degrees of sorcery are real and the third and
last degree is not real, scholars differ as to whether sorcery is real or merely
imaginary. Those who say that it is real have the first two degrees in mind. Those
who say that it is not real have the third and last degree in mind. There is no
difference of opinion among them about the matter itself, but (the difference of
opinion) results from confusing the different degrees (of sorcery).


No intelligent person doubts the existence of sorcery, because of the influence mentioned, which sorcery exercises. The Qur'an refers to it. It says, "... but the devils were unbelievers, teaching the people sorcery and that
which had been revealed in Babel to the two angels, Harut and Marut. Those two
always said before they taught anyone, 'We are a temptation. Do not be an
unbeliever.' 

People learned from them how to cause discord between a man and his wife. (However,) they were not able to harm anyone except with God's permission."755 

The Messenger of God, according to (the sound tradition of) the Sahih, 756
was put under a magic spell, so that he imagined that he was doing a thing while, in fact, he was not doing it. The spell against him was placed in a comb, in flakes of wool, and in the spathe of a palm, and buried in the well of Dharwan 757

Therefore, God revealed to him the following verses in the Mu'awwidhatan= "And (I take refuge in God) from the evil of the women who blow into knots." 758 'A'ishah said, "As soon as he recited the Qur'an over one of those knots into which a spell against him had been placed, that particular knot became untied." 759

There was much sorcery among the inhabitants of Babel, that is, the Nabataean and Syrian Chaldeans. The Qur'an mentions much of it, and there are traditions about it. Sorcery was greatly cultivated in Babel and in Egypt at the time of Moses' prophetic mission. 

Therefore, the miracle Moses performed (as a proof of his prophecy) was of the kind claimed and bragged about (by sorcerers). The temples in Upper Egypt are remnants (of sorcery) attesting to the (cultivation of sorcery in ancient Egypt).760
We have seen with our own eyes (how a sorcerer) formed the picture of a person who was to be cast under a spell. He represented in it the characteristics of things he intended and planned (to make) that person adopt, as already existing in
him in the shape of symbols of names and attributes in homonym fashion[?]. 761

Then he spoke (magic words) over the picture he had made to take the place of the person who was to be cast under a spell, concretely or symbolically 762 During the repeated pronunciation of the evil words, he collected spittle in his mouth and spat upon (the picture). 

Then he tied a knot over the symbol in an object that he had prepared for the purpose, 763 since he considered tying knots and (making things) stick together to be auspicious (and effective in magical operations). He also entered
into a pact with the jinn, asking them to participate in his spitting during the
operation, intending to make the spell forceful. This (human) figure and the evil
names have a harmful spirit. 

It issues from (the sorcerer) with his breath and attaches to the spittle he spits out. It produces (more) evil spirits. As a result, the things that the sorcerer intends (to happen to) the person who is cast under a spell, actually befall him.
We have also observed how people who practice sorcery point at a garment or a piece of leather and inwardly speak (magic words) over it, and behold! the object is torn to shreds. Others point in the same way at the bellies of sheep and goats at pasture with (a) ripping (gesture), and behold! the guts of the animals fall out of their bellies to the ground. 764

We have also heard that in contemporary India, there still are (sorcerers) who point at a man, and his heart is extracted 765 and he falls dead. When someone looks for his heart, he cannot find it among his inner parts. Or, they point to a
pomegranate. When someone opens it, no seeds are found in it.

We have likewise heard that in the Sudan and in the land of the Turks, there are (sorcerers) who cast a spell on a cloud, and rain falls upon a particular area 766 

Also, we have observed remarkable things as to the efficacy of talismans that make use of "the loving numbers" 220 and 284. The sum of the aliquot parts of each of the loving numbers, such as one-half, one-fourth, one-sixth, onefifth, and so on,
is equal to the other number.767 This is why the two numbers are called "loving
numbers." It is a tradition among the people who know about talismans that these
numbers may effect friendship and union between two lovers. Two effigies aremade, one of them with Venus as the ascendant, when, either in her house or in her exaltation, 768 she looks at the moon lovingly and invitingly. As the ascendant of the
other effigy, the seventh (house counting) from (that of) the first is taken. One of the
loving numbers is placed upon the one effigy, and the other upon the other. 

The larger number is meant for the person whose friendship is sought, that is, the beloved. I do not know whether "larger number" means the higher number, or the one with the greater number of aliquot parts. The result (of the magical operation) is
a close connection between the two lovers, so that the one is hardly able to break away from the other. This was reported by the author of the Ghayah 769 and other authorities on magic, and it is attested by experience 7 70
Then, there is "the lion seal," 771 which is also called "the pebble seal." 772

On a steel thimble,773 the sorcerer engraves the picture of a lion dragging its tail
and biting on pebbles which it thus divides into two parts. A snake is represented in
front of the lion. It is coiled at the lion's feet stretching upwards opposite the lion's
head, so that its open mouth faces the lion's mouth. Upon the lion's back, a crawling
scorpion is represented. In order to make the engraving, (the sorcerer) waits for a
time when the sun enters the first or third decan 774 of Leo, provided (further) that
the two luminaries (the sun and the moon) are well and out of their misfortune.

When he finds and gets this (constellation), he makes an impression (of the engraving) upon a mithqal or less of gold, which he then dips into saffron dissolved in rose water and preserves 775 in a yellow silk rag. (People) assume that the person who holds on to it has an indescribable power over rulers and is able to have close contact with them, to serve them, and to use them for his own ends. Likewise, the rulers themselves find in it strength and power over their subjects. This, too, was mentioned by authors on magic in the Ghayah 776 and other works, and it is attested by experience.

Then, there is the magic square of 36 fields that belongs to the sun. 777

It is said that it should be made when the sun enters its exaltation and is out of its misfortune, and when the moon is well and under a royal ascendant in which the master of the tenth (house) is considered to look upon the master of the
ascendant; lovingly and invitingly and in which exalted indications concerning royal
nativities prosper. 

It is preserved in a yellow silk rag, after having been dipped in perfume. (People) think that it influences one's friendship with rulers and one's (opportunity) to serve them and to be admitted into their company.
There are many similar things. 

The Kitab al-Ghayah by Maslamah b. Ahmad al-Majriti is the systematic treatment of this craft. It has it complete and presents its problems perfectly.

The imam Fakhr-ad-din b. alKhatib wrote a book on the subject which he entitled as-Sirr al-maktum. It is said to be in common use among the people in the East. We have not come across it. The imam (Fakhrad-din)
is not considered an authority on magic, though the contrary might be the case (and
he might have been an authority on magic) <!-- 7 78 -->
