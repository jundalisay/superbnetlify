Real dream vision is an awareness on the part of the rational soul in its spiritual essence, of glimpse(s) of the forms of events. While the soul is spiritual, the forms of events have actual existence in it, as is the case with all spiritual essences.

The soul becomes spiritual through freeing itself from bodily matters and corporeal perceptions. This happens to the soul (in the form of) glimpse(s) through the agency of sleep, as we shall mention. 

Through these, the soul gains the knowledge of future events that it desires and by means of which it regains the perceptions that (properly) belong to it. 

When this process is weak and indistinct, the soul applies to it allegory and imaginary pictures, in order to gain (the desired
knowledge). Such allegory, then, necessitates interpretation. 301 

When, on the other hand, this process is strong, it can dispense with allegory. Then, no interpretation is necessary, because (the process) is then free from imaginary pictures.The occurrence, in the soul, of such glimpse(s) is caused by the fact that the soul is potentially a spiritual essence, supplemented by the body and the perceptions of (the body). 

Its essence, thus, eventually becomes pure intellection, and its existence becomes perfect in actuality. The soul, now, is a spiritual essence having perception without the help of any of the bodily organs. 

However, among the spiritualia, it is of a lower species than the angels, who inhabit the highest stage, and who never had to supplement their essences with corporeal perceptions or anything else. 

The preparedness (for spirituality) comes to (the soul) as long as it is in the body. There is a special kind (of preparedness), such as saints have, and there is a general kind common to all human beings. This is what "dream vision" means.

In the case of the prophets, this preparedness is a preparedness to exchange humanity for pure angelicality, which is the highest rank of spiritualia. It expresses itself repeatedly during revelations. It exists when (the prophet) returns to the level
of corporeal perceptions. 

Whatever perception the prophet has at that moment is clearly similar to what happens in sleep, even though sleep is much inferior to revelation.

Because of this similarity, the Muhammad defined dream vision as being the 46th or the 43rd, or the 70th part of prophecy. 302

None of these fractions are literal. They are to indicate the great degree of difference between the various
stages (of supernatural perception). This is shown by the reference to "seventy" in one of the recensions. The number "seventy" is used by the Arabs to express (the idea of) a large number.

### 46

In its beginning, the revelation took the form of dream visions for six months, that is, for half a year. The whole duration of (Muhammad's) prophecy in Mecca and Medina was 23 years. Half a year, thus, is one forty-sixth (of the whole duration of prophecy). This theory cannot be verified. The given (figures) apply only to Muhammad. How can we know whether they also applied to other prophets? 

Moreover, this (theory) describes the relationship of prophecy to dream vision in point of time only, and does not consider the true character of dream visions in relation to the true character of prophecy. If our previous remarks were clear, it will
be realized that the fraction refers to the relationship between the primary preparedness general to all mankind, and the close preparedness limited to the (prophets) and natural to them.

The remote preparedness is commonly found among human beings.
However, there are many obstacles and hindrances that prevent man from translating
it into actuality. 

One of the greatest hindrances is the external senses. God, therefore,
created man. in such a way that the veil of the senses could be lifted through sleep,
which is a natural function of man. When that veil is lifted, the soul is ready to learn
the things it desires to know in the world of Truth (haqq). At times, it catches a
glimpse of what it seeks. 

Therefore, the Lawgiver (Muhammad) classified dream visions among "the bearers of glad tidings" (mubashshirat). He said, "Nothing
remains of prophecy except the bearers of glad tidings." Asked what they were, he
said= "A good dream vision, beheld by - or shown to - a good man." 303

The reason why the veil of the senses is lifted in sleep is as follows.304 The
perceptions and actions of the rational soul are the result of the corporeal animal
spirit. This spirit is a fine vapor which is concentrated in the left cavity of the heart,
as stated in the anatomical works of Galen and others. 305 It spreads with the blood
in the veins and arteries, and makes sensual perception, motion, and all the other
corporeal actions possible. 

Its finest part goes up to the brain. There, it is temperedby the coldness of (the brain), and it effects the actions of the powers located in the
cavities of the brain. The rational soul perceives and acts only by means of that
vaporous spirit. It is connected with it. (This connection is) the result of the wisdom
of creation which requires that nothing fine can influence anything coarse. Of all the
corporeal matters, only the animal spirit is fine. Therefore, it is receptive to the
influence of the essence, which differs from it only in respect of corporeality, that is,
the rational soul. Thus, through the medium of (the animal spirit), the influence of
the rational soul reaches the body.
We have stated before 306 that the perception of the rational soul is of two
kinds. There is an external perception through the five senses, and an inward
perception through the cerebral powers. All these perceptions divert the rational soul
from the perception for which 307 it is prepared by nature, (namely, that) of the
essences of the spiritualia, which are higher than it.

Since the external senses are corporeal, they are subject to weakness and lassitude as the result of exertion and fatigue, and to spiritual exhaustion through too much activity. 

Therefore, God gave them the desire to rest, so that perfect perception may be renewed afterwards. Such (rest) is accomplished by the retirement of the animal spirit from all the external senses and its return to the inward sense.

This process is supported by the cold that covers the body during the night. Under the influence of the cold of the night, the natural heat repairs to the innermost recesses of the body and turns from its exterior to the interior. 

It thus guides its vehicle, the animal spirit, into the interior of the body. This is the reason why human beings, as a rule, sleep only at night.

The spirit, thus, withdraws from the external senses and returns to the inward powers. The preoccupations and hindrances of sensual perception lessen their hold over the soul, and it now returns to the forms that exist in the power of memory.

Then, through a process of synthesis and analysis, (these forms) are shaped into imaginary pictures. Most of these pictures are customary ones, because (the soul) has (only) shortly before withdrawn from the conventional objects of sensual perception.

It now transmits them to the common sense, which combines all the five external senses, to be perceived in the manner of (those) five senses. Frequently, however, the soul turns to its spiritual essence in concert with the inward powers. It then accomplishes the spiritual kind of perception for which it is fitted by nature. It takes up some of the forms of things that have become inherent in its essence at that time. 

Imagination seizes on those perceived forms, and pictures them in the customary molds either realistically or allegorically. Pictured allegorically, they require interpretation. The synthetic and analytic activity which (the soul) applies to the forms in the power of memory, before it perceives its share of glimpses (of the supernatural), is (what is called in the Qur'an) "confused dreams."

According to (the sound tradition of) the Sahih, the Prophet said, "There are three kinds of dream visions. There are dream visions from God, dream visions from the angels, and dream visions from Satan." 

This threefold division agrees with our preceding statement. 

Clear dream visions are from God. Allegorical dream visions, which call for interpretation, are from the angels. 

"Confused dreams" are from Satan, because they are altogether futile, as Satan is the source of futility.

This is what "dream vision" really is, and how it is caused and encouraged by sleep. It is a particular quality of the human soul common to all mankind. 

Nobody is free from it. Every human being has, more than once, seen something in his sleep that turned out to be true when he awakened. He knows for certain that the soul must necessarily have supernatural perception in sleep. If this is possible in the
realm of sleep, it is not impossible in other conditions, because the perceivingessence is one and its qualities are always present. God guides toward the truth.
