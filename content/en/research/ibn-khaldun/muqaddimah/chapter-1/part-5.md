<!-- FIFTH PREFATORY DISCUSSION -->

Not all the temperate zones:
- are abundant with food, nor
- have inhabitants with a comfortable life

In some parts, the inhabitants enjoy an abundance of grain, seasonings, wheat, and fruits, because the soil is well balanced and good for plants and there is an abundant civilization. 

In other parts, the land is strewn with rocks, and no seeds or herbs grow at all. There, the inhabitants have a very hard time. Instances of such people are the inhabitants of the Hijaz and the Yemen, or the Veiled Sinhajah who
live in the desert of the Maghrib on the fringes of the sandy deserts which lie between the Berbers and the Sudanese Negroes. All of them lack all grain and seasonings. 

Their nourishment and food is milk and meat. Another such people is the Arabs who roam the waste regions. They may get grain and seasonings from the hills, but this is the case only at certain times and is possible only under the eyes of the militia which protects (the hill country). Whatever they get is little, because they have little money. 

They obtain no more than the bare necessity, and sometimes less, and in no case enough for a comfortable or abundant life. They are mostly found restricted to milk, which is for them a very good substitute for wheat. In spite of
this, the desert people who lack grain and season body and better in character than the hill people who have plenty of everything.

Their complexions are clearer, their bodies cleaner, their figures more perfect and better, their characters less intemperate, and their minds keener as far as knowledge and perception are concerned. 

This is attested by experience in all these groups.

There is a great difference in this respect between the Arabs and Berbers (on the one hand), and the Veiled (Berbers) 234 and the inhabitants of the hills (on the other). This fact is known to those who have investigated the matter.

As to the reason for it, it may be tentatively suggested that a great amount of food and the moisture it contains generate pernicious superfluous matters in the body, which, in turn, produce a disproportionate widening of the body, as well as many corrupt, putrid humors. The result is a pale complexion and an ugly figure, because the person has too much flesh, as we have stated. When the moisture with its evil vapors ascends to the brain, the mind and the ability to think are dulled. 

The result is stupidity, carelessness, and a general intemperance. This can be exemplified by comparing the animals of waste regions and barren habitats, such as gazelles, wild cows (maha), ostriches, giraffes, onagers, and (wild) buffaloes (cows, bagar), with their counterparts among the animals that live in hills, coastal plains, and fertile pastures. There is a big difference between them with regard to the glossiness of their coat, their shape and appearance, the proportions of their limbs, and their sharpness of perception. 235 

The gazelle is the counterpart of the goat, and the giraffe that of the camel; the onagers and (wild) buffaloes (cows) are identical with (domestic) donkeys and oxen (and cows). Still, there is a wide difference between them. 

The only reason for it is the fact that the abundance of food in the hills produces pernicious superfluous matters and corrupt humors in the bodies of the domestic animals, the influence of which shows on them. Hunger, on the otherhand, may greatly improve the physique and shape of the animals of the waste regions.

The same applies to human beings. The inhabitants of fertile zones <!-- where the products of agriculture and animal husbandry as well as seasonings and fruits are plentiful, are, as a rule, --> are described as stupid in mind and
coarse in body. This is the case with those Berbers who have plenty of seasonings and wheat, as compared with those who lead a frugal life and are restricted to barley or durra, such as the Masmudah Berbers and the inhabitants of as-Sus and the Ghumarah. The latter are superior both intellectually and physically. 

The same applies in general to the inhabitants of the Maghrib who have plenty of seasonings and fine wheat, as compared with the inhabitants of Spain in whose country butter is altogether lacking and whose principal food is durra. The Spaniards are found to have a sharpness of intellect, a nimbleness of body, and a receptivity for instruction such as no one else has. 

The same also applies to the inhabitants of rural regions of the Maghrib as compared with the inhabitants of settled areas and cities. Both use many seasonings and live in abundance, but the town dwellers only use them after
they have been prepared and cooked and softened by admixtures. 

They thus lose their heaviness and become less substantial. Principal foods are the meat of sheep
and chickens. They do not use butter because of its tastelessness. Therefore the
moisture in their food is small, and it brings only a few pernicious superfluous
matters into their bodies. Consequently, the bodies of the urban population are found
to be more delicate than those of the inhabitants of the desert who live a hard life.
Likewise, those inhabitants of the desert who are used to hunger are found to have
in their bodies no superfluous matters, thick or thin.

The influence of abundance upon the body is apparent even in matters of religion and divine worship. The frugal inhabitants of the desert and those of settled areas who have accustomed themselves to hunger and to abstinence from pleasures are found to be more religious and more ready for divine worship than people who live in luxury and abundance. 

There are few religious people in towns and cities, in as much as people there are for the most part obdurate and careless, which is connected with the use of much meat, seasonings, and fine wheat. The existence of pious men and
ascetics is, therefore, restricted to the desert, whose inhabitants eat frugally.

Likewise, the condition of the inhabitants within a single city can be observed to differ according to the different distribution of luxury and abundance.

Those people who, whether they inhabit the desert or settled areas and cities, live a life of abundance and have all the good things to eat, die more quickly than others when a drought or famine comes upon them. 

This is the case, for instance, with the Berbers of the Maghrib and the inhabitants of the city of Fez and, as we hear, of Egypt (Cairo). It is not so with the Arabs who inhabit waste regions and deserts, or with the inhabitants of regions where the date palm grows and whose principal food is dates, or with the present-day inhabitants of Ifriqiyah whose principal food is barley and olive oil, or with the inhabitants of Spain whose principal food is durra and olive oil. When a drought or a famine strikes them, it does not kill as many of them as of the other group of people, and few, if any, die of hunger. 

As a reason for that, it may tentatively be suggested that the stomachs of those who have everything in abundance and are used to seasonings and, in particular, to butter, acquire moisture in addition to their basic constitutional
moisture, and (the moisture they are used to) eventually becomes excessive. 

Then, when (eating) habits are thwarted by small quantities of food, by lack of seasonings, and by the use of coarse food to which it is unaccustomed, the stomach, which is a very weak part of the body and for that reason considered one of the vital parts, soon dries out and contracts. 

Sickness and sudden death are prompt consequences tothe man whose stomach is in this condition. Those who die satiation, not of the hunger that now afflicts them for the first time. In those who are accustomed to thirst and to doing without seasonings and butter, the basic moisture, which is good for all natural foods, always stays within its proper limits and does not increase.

Thus, their stomachs are not affected by dryness or intemperance in consequence of a change of nourishment. As a rule, they escape the fate that awaits others on account of the abundance of their food and the great amount of seasonings in it.

The basic thing to know is that foodstuffs, and whether to use or not to use them, are matters of custom. Whoever accustoms himself to a particular type of food that agrees with him becomes used to it. 

He finds it painful to give it up or to make any changes (in his diet), provided (the type of food) is not something that does not
fulfill the (real) purpose of food, such as poison, or alkaloids, 2 36 or anything
excessively intemperate. 

Whatever can be used as food and is agreeable may be used as customary food. If a man accustoms himself to the use of milk and
vegetables instead of wheat, until (the use of them) gets to be his custom, milk and vegetables become for him (his habitual) food, and he definitely has no longer any need for wheat or grains.

The same applies to those who have accustomed themselves to suffer hunger and do without food. Such things are reported about trained (ascetics). We hear remarkable things about men of this type. Those who have no knowledge of things
of the sort can scarcely believe them. 

The explanation lies in custom. Once the soul gets used to something, it becomes part of its make-up and nature, because (the soul)
is able to take on many colorings. If through gradual training it has become used to
hunger, (hunger) becomes a natural custom of the soul.

The assumption of physicians that hunger causes death is not correct, except when a person is exposed suddenly to hunger and is entirely cut off from food. 

Then, the stomach is isolated, and contracts an illness that may be fatal. When, however, the amount of food one eats is slowly decreased by gradual training, there is no danger of death. The adepts of Sufism practice (such gradual abstinence from
food). Gradualness is also necessary when one gives up the training. Were a person
suddenly to return to his original diet, he might die. 

Therefore, he must end the training as he started it, that is, gradually.

We personally saw a person who had taken no food for forty or more consecutive days. Our shaykhs were present at the court of Sultan Abul-Hasan 237

when two women from Algeciras and Ronda were presented to him, who had for
years abstained from all food. Their story became known. They were examined, and
the matter was found to be correct. The women continued this way until they died.
Many persons we used to know restricted themselves to (a diet of) goat's milk. They
drank from the udder sometime during the day or at breakfast. 237a This was their
only food for fifteen years. There are many others (who live similarly). It should not
be considered unlikely.

It should be known that everybody who is able to suffer hunger or eat only
little, is physically better off if he stays hungry than if he eats too much. Hunger has
a favorable influence on the health and well-being of body and intellect, as we have
stated. This may be exemplified by the different influence of various kinds of food
upon the body. We observe that those persons who live on the meat of strong, large-
bodied animals grow up as a (strong and large-bodied) race. Comparison of the
inhabitants of the desert with those of settled areas shows this. The same applies to
persons who live on the milk and meat of camels. This influences their character, so
that they become patient, persevering, and able to carry loads, as is the case with
camels. 238 

Their stomachs also grow to be healthy and tough as the stomachs ofcamels. They are not beset by any feebleness or weakness, nor are they affected by unwholesome food, as others are. They may take strong (alkaloid) cathartics unadulterated to purify their bellies, such as, for instance, unripe colocynths, Thapsia garganica, and Euphorbia. Their stomachs do not suffer any harm from them. 

But if the inhabitants of settled areas, whose stomachs have become delicate
because of their soft diet, were to partake of them, death would come to them
instantly, because (these cathartics) have poisonous qualities.
An indication of the influence of food upon the body is a fact that has been
mentioned by agricultural scholars 239 and observed by men of experience, that
when the eggs of chickens which have been fed on grain cooked in camel dung, are
set to hatch, the chicks come out as large as can be imagined. One does not even
have to cook any grain to feed them; one merely smears camel dung on the eggs set
to hatch, and the chickens that come out are extremely large. 

When we observe the various ways in which food exercises an influence
upon bodies, there can be no doubt that hunger also exercises an influence upon
them, because two opposites follow the same pattern with regard to exercising an
influence or not exercising an influence. Hunger influences the body in that it keeps
it free from corrupt superfluities and mixed fluids that destroy body and intellect, in
the same way that food influenced the (original) existence of the body.
