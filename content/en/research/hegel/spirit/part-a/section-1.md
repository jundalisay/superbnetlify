<!-- – A – CONSCIOUSNESS (1) -->

## 1. The Object of Perceptions 
<!-- Sense Certainty -->

{{< s v="90" >}} Immediate knowledge is the knowledge of the immediate, of what is.

<!-- The knowledge, which is at the start or immediately our object, can be nothing else than just that which is  -->

With immediate knowledge, we immediately accept what is given. We do not alter anything in it.  
<!-- as it is presented before us, and keeping mere apprehension (Auffassen) free from conceptual comprehension (Begreifen). -->


{{< s v="91" >}} Our senses give us concrete and sure content. 
- This gives us an impression that it is the richest and truest kind of knowledge. 

<!-- , to be even a knowledge of endless wealth – a wealth to which we can as little find any limit when we traverse its extent in space and time, where that content is presented before us, as when we take a fragment out of the abundance it offers us and by dividing and dividing seek to penetrate its intent.  -->

<!-- This is because it seems that sensory knowledge has not yet dropped anything from the object.  -->
This is because it seems that the knowledge that we get from our senses has not yet dropped anything from its object. 
- It has the object before itself in its entirety and completeness.

This bare fact of sureness <!-- certainty -->, however:
- is really the most abstract and poor kind of truth
- merely says regarding what it knows: it exists.
<!-- is; -->

Its only truth is that this sureness was sensed.
<!-- contains solely the being of the fact it knows.  -->

In this case, consciousness takes the shape merely of pure Ego. 
<!-- , on its part, in the case of this form of certainty, -->
- 'I' in such a case am merely qua pure 'This'. 
- The object likewise is merely qua pure 'This'. 


The conscious, sensing I, is certain of this fact before me. But this is not because:
<!-- - I qua consciousness have developed myself in connection with it, or -->
- that consciousness has developed a connection with it, or
 <!-- and in manifold ways set thought to work about it, or  -->
- the relation of that thing was unrelated to other things.
<!-- - the fact, the thing and its distinct qualities, of which I am certain, lacked possible modes of relation and a variety of connections with other things. -->

<!-- Neither has anything to do with the truth sensuous certainty contains.  -->

<!-- Neither the I nor the thing has here the meaning of a manifold relation with a variety of other things, of mediation in a variety of ways.  -->

This sensing 'I':
- does not contain or imply a manifold of ideas
- does not think about the multiplicity of qualities of the thing

Instead, this sensing 'I' merely says that the thing or the fact exists. 


Existence is the essential point for sense-knowledge. 
- The truth in sense-knowledge is the simple immediacy of the existence of something. 

<!-- In the same way, the certainty qua relation, the certainty “of” something, is an immediate pure relation.  -->

In the same way, the certainty “of” something is an immediate pure relation. 

Consciousness is I* – nothing more, a pure this. 

<!-- > *Superphysics note: Here Kant confuses consciousness for identity and the ego -->


The individual consciousness knows a pure this, or knows what is individual.


{{< s v="92" >}} But, when we look closely, there is much more implied in that bare pure being. 
<!-- , which constitutes the kernel of this form of certainty. -->
<!-- , and is given out by it as its truth. -->

A concrete actual certainty of sense is not merely this pure immediacy.
- It is but an example, an instance, of that immediacy.

<!-- Amongst the innumerable distinctions that here come to light, we find in all cases  -->
