{{< s v='123' >}}  Consciousness, then, gets away also from this second form of perceptual procedure, that, namely, which takes the thing as the true selfsame, and itself as the reverse, as the factor that leaves sameness behind and goes back into self.

Its object is now the entire process which was previously shared between the object and consciousness.

The thing is a “one”, reflected into self. It is for itself. But it is also for an other. It is an other for itself as it is for another. 

The thing is, hence, for itself and also for another, a being that has difference of a twofold kind. 

But it is also “one”. 

Its being “one”, however, contradicts the diversity it has. 

Consciousness would, consequently, have again to make itself answerable for putting the diversity into the “one”. It would have to keep this apart from the thing. 

It would thus be compelled to say that the thing “in-so-far as” it is for itself is not for another. 

But the oneness belongs to the thing itself, too, as consciousness has found out. The thing is essentially reflected into self. 

The “also”, the distinction of elements indifferent to one another, falls doubtless within the thing as well as the “oneness”, but since both are different, they do not fall within the same thing, but in different things. 

The contradiction which is found in the case of the objective content as a whole is assigned to and shared by two objects. 

The thing is, thus, doubtless as it stands (an und für sich) selfsame. But this unity with itself is disturbed by other things. 

In this way, the unity of the thing is preserved. At the same time, the otherness is preserved outside the thing, as well as outside consciousness.


{{< s v='124' >}} Although the contradiction in the object is in this way allotted to different things, yet the isolated individual thing will still be affected with distinction. 

The different things have a subsistence on their own account. The conflict between them takes place on both sides in such a way that each is not different from itself, but only from the other.

Each, however, is thereby characterized as a something distinctive, and contains in it essential distinction from the others.
- But at the same time not in such a way that this is an opposition within its being.
- On the contrary, it is by itself a simple determinate characteristic which constitutes its essential character, distinguishing it from others. 

Since the diversity lies in it, this diversity does necessarily assume the form of a real distinction of manifold qualities within it. 
- But because the determinate characteristic gives the essence of the thing, by which it is distinguished from others, and has a being all its own, this further manifold constitution is something indifferent. 

The thing thus contains in its unity the qualifying “in-so-far” in 2 ways which have unequal significance.
- This oppositeness becomes not a real opposition on the part of the thing itself, but – so far as the thing comes into a condition of opposition through its absolute distinction – this opposition belongs to the thing with reference to an other thing lying outside it. 

The further manifoldness is doubtless necessarily in the thing too, and cannot be left out; but it is unessential to the thing.


{{< s v='125' >}} This determinate characteristic, which constitutes the essential character of the thing and distinguishes it from all others, is now so defined that thereby the thing, stands in opposition to others, but must therein preserve itself for itself. 

It is, however, a thing, a self-existent “one”, only so far as it does not stand in relation to others.

For in this relation, the connection with another is rather the point emphasized, and connection with another means giving up self-existence, means ceasing to have a being on its own account. 

It is precisely through the absolute character and its opposition that the thing relates itself to others, and is essentially this process of relation, and only this. The relation, however, is the negation of its independence, and the thing collapses through its own essential property.


{{< s v='126' >}} The necessity of the experience which consciousness has to go through in finding that the thing is destroyed just by the very characteristic which constitutes its essential nature and its distinctive existence on its own account, may, as regards the bare principle it implies, be shortly stated thus. 

The thing is set up as having a being of its own, as existing for itself, or as an absolute negation of all otherness; hence it is absolute negation merely relating itself to itself. But this kind of negation is the cancelling and superseding of itself, or means that it has its essential reality in an other.


{{< s v='127' >}} In point of fact the determination of the object, as it (the object) has turned out, contains nothing else. It aims at having an essential property, constituting its bare existence for itself, but with this bare self-existence it means also to embrace and contain diversity, which is to be necessary, but is at the same time not to constitute its essential characteristic. 

But this is a distinction that only exists in words; the nonessential, which has all the same to be necessary, cancels its own meaning, or is what we have just called the negation of itself.


{{< s v='128' >}}  With this the last qualifying “in-so-far”, which separated self-existence and existence for another, drops away altogether. The object is really in one and the same respect the opposite of itself-for itself “so far as” it is for another, and for another “so far as” it is for itself.

It is for itself, reflected into self, one; but all this is asserted along with its opposite, with its being for another, and for that reason is asserted merely to be superseded. In other words, this existence for itself is as much unessential as that which alone was meant to be unessential, viz. the relation to another.
