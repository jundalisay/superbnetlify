{{< s v='119' >}} I am aware of the “thing” as a one. I have to keep it fixed in this true character as one. 

If in the course of perceiving, something crops up to contradict that unity. When perceiving, various different properties also turn up. These seem to be the properties of the thing. 
- This creates diversity cancels the unity in the thing.
- This diversity falls on us.

But the thing is a “one”. It is:
- white to our eyes
- tart to our tongue
- cubical to our feeling, and so on.

The entire diversity of these aspects comes from us, not from the thing.
- We find them falling apart from one another, because the organs they affect are quite distinct.
  - The eye is entirely distinct from the tongue, and so on. 

We are, consequently, the universal medium where such elements get dissociated, and exist each by itself. 

We thus regard the characteristic of being a universal medium as our reflection. In this way, we preserve and maintain the self-sameness and truth of the thing, its being a “one”.


{{< s v='120' >}} Consciousness puts these diverse aspects to its side of the account. However, each of these aspects by itself are how it appears in the universal medium, specifically determined. 

White is only opposed to black, and so on. The thing is a “one” just by the fact that it is opposed to other things*.

> *Superphysics Note: Here is the start of identity. 


It does not, however, exclude others from itself, so far as it is “one”. To be “one” is to be in a universal relation of self to self. Hence, a thing is rather like all because of it being “one”. 
- It is through the determinate characteristic [identity] that the thing excludes other things. 

Things themselves are thus determinate in and for themselves. They have properties by which they distinguish themselves from one another. 

The thing has several properties because property is a specific characteristic in the thing itself.
<!-- the special and peculiar property [the proper property] of the thing, or , . -->

1. This is because the thing is true being, is a being inherently in itself.
- What is in it is its own essential nature, and not on account of other things.

2. Hence, its properties are not on account of other things and for other things, but inherent in that thing itself.

<!-- They are, however, determinate properties in it only by the fact that they are several, and maintain their distinction from one another.  -->

3. Its properties are self-contained, each in and for itself. They are indifferent to one another. 

<!-- It is, then, in truth the thing itself which is white, and also cubical, and also tart, and so on.  -->

In other words, the thing is the “also”, the general medium, wherein the many properties subsist externally to one another, without touching or affecting one another, and without canceling one another; and, so taken, the thing is taken as what it truly is.


{{< s v='120' >}} On this mode of perception arising, consciousness is at the same time aware that it reflects itself also into itself.
- In perceiving, the opposite moment to the “also” crops up. 

This moment, however, is the unity of the thing with itself.
- It is a unity which excludes distinction from itself. 

It is consequently this unity which consciousness has to take on itself. For the thing as such is the subsistence of many different and independent properties. 

Thus we that a thing “is white, and also cubical, and also tart”, etc. 
- But so far as it is white it is not cubical, and so far as it is cubical and also white it is not tart, and so on. 

Putting these properties into a “one” belongs solely to consciousness which has to avoid letting them coincide and be one (i.e. one and the same property) in the thing.
- This is why it introduces the idea of “in-so-far” to meet the difficulty.
- Through this, it:
  - keeps the qualities apart, and
  - preserves the thing in the sense of the “also”*.


> *Superphysics Note: The mind has to keep the properties distinct yet connected with other properties, via 'also'. 

Consciousness at first makes itself responsible for the "oneness" in such a way that what was called a property is represented as being “free matter” (materia libera). (3) 

In this way, the thing is raised to the level of a true "also" since it thus becomes a collection of component elements (materials or matters), instead of being a "one” becomes a mere enclosure, a circumscribing.


{{< s v='122' >}} If we look back on what consciousness formerly took on itself, and now takes upon itself, what it previously ascribed to the thing, and now ascribes to it, we see that consciousness alternately makes itself, as well as the thing, into both a pure atomic many-less “one”, and an “also” resolved into independent constituent elements (materials or matters). 

Consciousness thus finds through this comparison:
- that its way of taking the truth contains the diverse moments of apprehension and returns on itself
- that the truth itself, the thing, manifests itself in this twofold manner. 

As a result of experience, the thing exhibits itself in a specific way to the consciousness seeing it.

But at the same time, it is reflected back into itself out of that manner of presenting itself to consciousness.
- In other words, the thing contains within it opposite aspects of truth, a truth whose elements are in antithesis to one another.
