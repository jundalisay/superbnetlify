{{< s v='76' >}} But we do not need to concern ourselves with useless ideas and expressions.

 <!-- about knowledge, as an instrument to take hold of the Absolute, or as a medium through which we have a glimpse of truth, and so on (relations to which all these ideas of a knowledge which is divided from the Absolute and an Absolute divided from knowledge in the last resort lead), we need not .  -->

<!-- Nor need we trouble about the evasive pretexts which create the incapacity of science out of the presupposition of such relations, in order at once to be rid of the toil of science, and to assume the air of serious and zealous effort about it. -->

Instead of being troubled with such things, they may be straightway rejected as arbitrary ideas that are deceptive.
- They even ward off science by making a mere empty show of knowledge which at once vanishes when science comes on the scene.

<!-- ; and the use which is here made of words like “absolute”,"knowledge”, as also “objective” and “subjective”, and innumerable others, whose meaning is assumed to be familiar to everyone, might well be regarded as so much deception.  -->

<!-- For to give out that their significance is universally familiar and that everyone indeed possesses their notion, rather looks like an attempt to dispense with the only important matter, which is just to give this notion.  -->

<!-- With better right, on the contrary, we might spare ourselves the trouble of talking any notice at all of such ideas and ways of talking which would have the effect of warding off science altogether; for they  -->

But science, in the very fact that it comes on the scene, is itself a phenomenon.
- Its “coming on the scene” is not yet itself carried out in all the length and breadth of its truth.

It does not matter that science is the phenomenon because it appears alongside another kind of knowledge.
<!-- , or call that other untrue knowledge its process of appearing.  -->

Science, however, must liberate itself from this phenomenality.
- It can only do so by turning against it. 

Science cannot simply:
- reject a form of knowledge which is not true, and
- treat this as a common view of things, and then
- assure us that itself is an entirely different kind of knowledge, and holds the other to be of no account at all.

Nor can it appeal to the fact that in this other there are presages of a better. 

By giving that assurance it would declare its force and value to lie in its bare existence.

But the untrue knowledge appeals likewise to the fact that it is, and assures us that to it science is nothing. 

One barren assurance, however, is of just as much value as another. 

<!-- Still less can science appeal to the presages of a better, which are to be found present in untrue knowledge and are there pointing the way towards science; for it would, on the one hand, be appealing again in the same way to a merely existent fact; and, on the other, it would be appealing to itself, to the way in which it exists in untrue knowledge, i.e. to a bad form of its own existence, to its appearance, rather than to its real and true nature (an und für sich). -->

This is why we shall here undertake the exposition of knowledge as a phenomenon.


## The Pathway to Knowledge

{{< s v='77' >}} This exposition only has phenomenal knowledge as its object. 

The exposition itself is not a science, free, self-moving in the shape proper to itself. 

It is a **pathway** of the natural consciousness which is pressing forward to true knowledge. 
- It is the path of the soul traversing the series of its own forms of embodiment
  - It is like stages appointed for it by its own nature, so that it may possess the clearness of spiritual life when, through the complete experience of its own self, it arrives at the knowledge of what it is in itself.


{{< s v='78' >}} **Natural consciousness will prove itself to be only knowledge in principle or not real knowledge.** 

It immediately takes itself to be the real and genuine knowledge. 

This pathway has a negative significance for consciousness because being on this path makes phenomenal knowledge lose its own truth.
- The path gives us conscious insight into the **untruth** of the phenomenal knowledge
<!-- What is a realization of the notion of knowledge means for it rather the ruin and overthrow of itself; for on this road it .  -->
- Because of that, the road is seen as the path of doubt or highway of despair.


<!-- , for which that is the most real which is after all only the unrealized notion.  -->

<!-- For what happens there is not what is usually understood by doubting, a jostling against this or that supposed truth, the outcome of which is again a disappearance in due course of the doubt and a return to the former truth, so that at the end the matter is taken as it was before. On the contrary, that pathway is the  -->

<!-- This is why this thoroughgoing scepticism is not what doubtless earnest zeal for truth and science fancies it has equipped itself with in order to be ready to deal with them — viz. the resolve, in science, not to deliver itself over to the thoughts of others on their mere authority, but to examine everything for itself, and only follow its own conviction, or, still better, to produce everything itself and hold only its own act for true. -->


## Skepticism

{{< s v=79 >}} Consciousness traverses on this road through a series of shapes.
- It is the detailed history of the process of training consciousness onto the level of science.

The end goal is to be a science, abstract intention, or untruth.
- This pathway, on the other hand, is, is the actual carrying out of that process of development.

<!-- That resolve presents this mental development in the simple form of an intended purpose, as immediately finished and complete, as having taken place. -->

To follow one's own conviction is certainly more than to hand oneself over to authority.

But by the conversion of opinion held on authority into opinion held out of personal conviction, the content of what is held is not necessarily altered, and truth has not thereby taken the place of error. 

If we stick to a system of opinion and prejudice resting on the authority of others, or upon personal conviction, the one differs from the other merely in the conceit which animates the latter. 

On the contrary, skepticism directed to the whole phenomenal consciousness makes mind qualified to test what truth is.
- It brings about a despair on our natural views, thoughts, and opinions.
- It does not matter to whom those natural views belong.

<!-- , which it is matter of indifference to call personal or belonging to others, and with which the consciousness, that proceeds straight away to criticize and test, is still filled and hampered, thus being, as a matter of fact, incapable of what it wants to undertake. -->

The completeness of the forms of unreal consciousness will be brought about precisely through the necessity of the advance and the necessity of their connection with one another. 

<!-- To make this comprehensible we may remark, by way of preliminary, that  -->

The exposition of untrue consciousness in its untruth is not a merely negative process. 
- The natural consciousness generally adopts such a one-sided view of it.
- A kind of knowledge makes this one-sidedness its essence.
  - It is one of those shapes assumed by incomplete consciousness which falls into the course of the inquiry itself and will come before us there. 

This is the view of scepticism.
- It only sees pure nothingness in the result.
- It abstracts from the fact that this nothing is determinate, is the nothing of that out of which it comes as a result.

Nothing, however, is only, in fact, the true result, when taken as the nothing of what it comes from; it is thus itself a determinate nothing, and has a content. 

The scepticism which ends with the abstraction “nothing” or “emptiness” can advance from this not a step farther. 
- It must wait and see whether there is possibly anything new offered, and what that is — in order to cast it into the same abysmal void. 

When once, on the other hand, the result is apprehended, as it truly is, as determinate negation, a new form has thereby immediately arisen.

In the negation, the transition is made by which the progress through the complete succession of forms comes about of itself.
