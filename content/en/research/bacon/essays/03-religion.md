RELIGION is the chief band of human society.

It is a happy thing, when itself is well contained within the true band of unity. 

The quarrels, and divisions about religion, were evils unknown to the heathen. This was because the religion of the heathen consisted in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief.

<!-- For you may imagine, what kind of faith theirs was, when  -->

The chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets. 

But the true God  <!-- hath this attribute, that he  --> is a jealous God. Therefore, his worship and religion will endure no mixture, nor partner. 

<!-- We shall therefore speak a few words, concerning the unity of the church; what are the fruits thereof; what the bounds; and what the means. -->

There are 2 fruits of unity (next unto the well pleasing of God, which is all in all): 

1. The unity outside of the church

Heresies and schisms are the greatest scandals worse than the corruption of manners. For as in the natural body, a wound, or solution of continuity, is worse than a corrupt humor; so in the spiritual.

Such a breach of unity drives men out of the church the most. 

<!-- Therefore, whensoever it cometh to that pass, that one saith, Ecce in deserto, another saith, Ecce in penetralibus; that is, when some men seek Christ, in the conventicles of heretics, and others, in an outward face of a church, that voice had need continually to sound in men's ears, Nolite exire,â€”Go not out.  -->

<!-- The doctor of the Gentiles (the propriety of whose vocation, drew him to have a special care of those without) saith, if an heathen come in, and hear you speak with several tongues, will he not say that you are mad?  -->

Certainly it is little better when atheists and profane persons hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion.

It averts them from the church, and makes them scorners. 

It is but a light thing, to be vouched in so serious a matter, but yet it expresseth well the deformity. There is a master of scoffing, that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library, sets down this title of a book, The Morris-Dance of Heretics. 

For indeed, every sect of them, hath a diverse posture, or cringe by themselves, which cannot but move derision in worldlings, and depraved politics, who are apt to contemn holy things.



2. The unity within the church

This brings peace which contains infinite blessings:
- It establishes faith
- It kindles:
  - charity
  - the outward peace of the church and distills into peace of conscience
- It turns the labors of writing, and reading of controversies, into treaties of mortification and devotion.

The bounds of unity has 2 extremes. 

To certain zealants, all talk of peace is odious.

<!-- Is it peace, Jehu,? What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. Peace is not the matter, but following, and party.  -->

Contrariwise, certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion, by middle way.
- They take part of both with witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrament between God and man. 

Both these extremes are to be avoided. This can be done, if the league of Christians, penned by Jesus were in 2 cross clauses thereof, soundly and plainly expounded:

1. He that is not with us, is against us

2. He that is not against us, is with us

The second one has the fundamentals and substance of religion truly discerned from mere opinion, order, or good intention.

<!-- This is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial, and done already. But if it were done less partially, it would be embraced more generally. -->

According to my small model, men should be careful of rending God's church through the 2 kinds of controversies. 

1. The controversy is too small and light, not worth the heat and strife about it, kindled only by contradiction. 

<!-- The one is, when the matter of the point controverted, -->

Christ's coat had no seam. But the church's vesture was of diverse colors: unity is different from  uniformity. 

<!-- ; whereupon he saith, In veste varietas sit, scissura non sit; they be two things,  -->

2. The controversy is great, but is driven to an over-great subtilty and obscurity

It becomes an ingenious thing rather than a substantial one. 

A man with good judgment might sometimes hear ignorant men differ

, and know well within himself, that those which so differ, mean one thing, and yet they themselves would never agree. And if it come so to pass, in that distance of judgment, which is between man and man, shall we not think that God above, that knows the heart, doth not discern that frail men, in some of their contradictions, intend the same thing; and accepteth of both? 

The nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by St. Paul.

 <!-- in the warning and precept, that he giveth concerning the same, Devita profanas vocum novitates, et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae.  -->

Men create oppositions, which are not; and put them into new terms, so fixed, as whereas the meaning ought to govern the term, the term in effect governeth the meaning. 

There be also two false peaces, or unities: the one, when the peace is grounded, but upon an implicit ignorance; for all colors will agree in the dark: the other, when it is pieced up, upon a direct admission of contraries, in fundamental points. 

For truth and falsehood, in such things, are like the iron and clay, in the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image; they may cleave, but they will not incorporate.

How do we get unity?

Men must beware, that in the procuring, or reuniting, of religious unity, they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity, and of human society. 

There are 2 swords amongst Christians:

1. The spiritual

2. The temporal

Both have their due office and place, in the maintenance of religion. 

But we should not take up the third sword -- the sword of The Prophet Mohammad. It propagates religion by wars, or by sanguinary persecutions to force consciences.

<!-- ; except it be in cases of overt scandal, blasphemy, or intermixture of practice against the state; much less to nourish seditions; to authorize conspiracies and rebellions; to put the sword into the people's hands; and the like; tending to the subversion of all government, which is the ordinance of God.  -->

This is but to dash the first table against the second sword and so to consider men as Christians, as we forget that they are men. 



Agamemnon could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter. Lucretius the poet exclaimed: Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum.

What would he have said, if he had known of the massacre in France, or the powder treason of England? 

He would have been seven times more Epicure, and atheist, than he was.


The temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion; so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people.

Let that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other furies.

It was great blasphemy, when the devil said, I will ascend, and be like the highest; 

It is greater blasphemy:
- to personate God and bring him in saying:  "I will descend and be like the prince of darkness"
- to make the cause of religion descend to the cruelty of murdering princes, butchering people, and subverting governments

<!-- Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the likeness of a dove, in the shape of a vulture or raven; and set, out of the bark of a Christian church, a flag of a bark of pirates, and assassins.  -->

Therefore, the following must damn and send to hell forever those opinions tending do such:
- the church, by doctrine and decree
- the princes by their sword
- the Christian and moral learned people

<!-- , as by their Mercury rod -->

 <!-- the support of the same; as hath been already in good part done. -->

<!-- Surely in counsels concerning religion, that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hominis non implet justitiam Dei.

And it was a notable observation of a wise father, and no less ingenuously confessed; that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences, were commonly interested therein, themselves, for their own ends. -->
