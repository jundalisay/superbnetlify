{{< sup v="20" >}}  

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
Tell us what the kingdom of heaven is like.
{{< /r >}}

He said to them, "It is like a mustard seed. It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it falls
on tilled soil, it produces a great plant and becomes a shelter for birds of the sky."




{{< sup v="21" >}}  

{{< r a="Mary" >}}  
Jesus, whom are your disciples like?"
{{< /r >}}  


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
They are like children who have settled in a field which is not theirs. 

When the owners of the field come, they will say, 'Let us have back our field.'

They will undress in their presence in order to let them have back their field and to give it back to them.

Therefore if the owner of a house knows that the thief is coming, he will begin his vigil before he comes and will not let him dig through into his house of his domain to carry away his goods. 

You, then, be on your guard against the world. Arm yourselves with great strength lest the robbers find a way to come to you, for the difficulty which
you expect will (surely) materialize. Let there be among you a man of understanding.

When the grain ripened, he came quickly with his sickle in his hand and reaped it. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.

{{< sup v="22" >}} Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples:

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}  
Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make
the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female. 

When you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the
kingdom.

{{< sup v="23" >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
I shall choose you, one out of a thousand, and two out of ten thousand, and they shall stand as a single one.
{{< /l >}}

{{< sup v="24" >}} His disciples said to him:

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}  
Show us the place where you are, since it is necessary for us to seek it.
{{< /r >}}  

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Whoever has ears, let him hear. There is light within a man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness.
