{{< sup v="12" >}}  The disciples said to Jesus:

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
We know that you will depart from us. Who is to be our leader?"
{{< /r >}} 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Wherever you are, you are to go to James the righteous, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being.
{{< /l >}}

{{< sup v="13" >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Compare me to someone and tell me whom I am like.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simon-Peter" >}} 
You are like a righteous angel.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Matthew" >}}
You are like a wise philosopher.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Thomas" >}}
Master, my mouth is wholly incapable of saying whom you are like.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring which I have measured out.
{{< /l >}}

He took him and withdrew and told him three things. When Thomas returned to his companions, they asked him:

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
What did Jesus say to you?
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Thomas" >}}
If I tell you one of the things which he told me, you will pick up stones and throw them at me. A fire will come out of the stones and burn you up.
{{< /r >}}


{{< sup v="14" >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
If you fast, you will give rise to sin for yourselves. If you pray, you will be condemned. If you give alms, you will do harm to your spirits.

When you go into any land and walk about in the districts, if they receive you, eat what they will set before you, and heal the sick among them. For what goes into your mouth will not defile you, but that which issues from your mouth - it is that which will defile you.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
When you see one who was not born of woman, prostrate yourselves on your faces and worship him. That one is your father.
{{< /l >}}

(16) 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Men think, perhaps, that it is peace which I have come to cast upon the world. They do not know that it is dissension which I have come to cast upon the earth: fire, sword, and war. 

For there will be five in a house: three will be against two, and two against three, the father against the son, and the son against the father. And they will
stand solitary.

(17) 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
I shall give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has never occurred to the human mind.
{{< /l >}}

(18)

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
Tell us how our end will be.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Have you discovered, then, the beginning, that you look for the end? 

For where the beginning is, there will the end be. Blessed is he who will take his place in the beginning; he will know the end and will not experience death.
{{< /l >}}

(19) 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Blessed is he who came into being before he came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there
are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer and winter and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever becomes acquainted with them will not experience
death.
