I also thought of a way to find the distance, magnitude, and weight of some ﬁxed stars through the reduction of their light's velocity. 

This is in reference to Dr. PRIESTLEY's History of Optics, which mentions the reduction of the velocity of light due to the sun's gravity. 

But it's difficult to find data for this. Nevertheless, I'll share this method.

being, as has been faid before111 article 3d, the fame with that i
of a comet levolving in a parabolic Orbit in the fame place, .
would be about 20,72 times greater than that of the earth in
its orbit at its mean diﬂance from the fun; 1'01 the mean dif-

{1111’s femidiameters, the velocity of fuch a comet would be
greater at that diﬁance than at the diﬁance of the earth from
the fun, in the fub—duplicate ratio of 214,64 to I, and the ve-_
locity of the comet being likewife greater than that of planets, >
at their mean diﬁances, in the fub--duplicate ratio of 2 to I ;
thefe, when taken together, will make the fub-~duplicate ratio
of429,28 to 1, and the fquare root of 429,28 is 20,72, Very

a fphm‘e of the fame dentityfwith the funwere to exceed that of
the fun 3111‘ the preportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an

‘ﬁty With the fun; was of any other ﬁze lefs than 4-97 times
that of the fun, though the velocity of the light emitted from
{nch a body, Would neverbe Wholly def’troyed, yet- Would .it

to reprefent the femi-diameter of the {11:11, and as to reprefent
the femi-diameter of the propofed- fphw‘e; then,as appears.
from what has been fhewn before, the ‘fquare root of the dif-
ference between the {quare of 497 S and the fquare of as will
be always proportional to the ultimately remaining velocity,
after it has {uttered all the diminution, it can poﬂibly fuﬁ‘er
from this caufe; ahd confequently the diference betWeen the
Whole velocity of light, and the remaining velocity, as found
above, will be the diminution of1ts velocity.A11d hence the
