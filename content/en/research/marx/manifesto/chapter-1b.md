The capitalist focuses on centralization. It has:
- agglomerated population <!--  keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property.  --> 
- centralised the means of production
- concentrated property in a few hands. 

This necessarily led to political centralisation. 

<!-- Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff. -->

This centralization has led to colossal productive forces in less than 100 years. 

<!-- The capitalists, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more  than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour? -->

<!-- We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the capitalists built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. -->

They replaced feudalism with free competition <!-- , accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and --> under the economic and political sway of the capitalist class.

<!-- A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern capitalist society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.  -->


This centralization has led to the revolt of modern productive forces that manifests as having too much production, too much commerce, too much civlization. 

<!-- 
For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of  against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the capitalist and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire capitalist society on its trial, each time more threateningly. 

In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. 

In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity — the epidemic of over-production. 

Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce.  -->

<!-- The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of capitalist property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of capitalist society, endanger the existence of capitalist property. The conditions of capitalist society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.  -->

The capitalists solves these by:
- the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces
- the conquest of new markets and a more thorough exploitation of the old ones.

<!--  That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented. -->

The weapons which the capitalists used against feudalism are now turned against the capitalists itself.

They also created the class that will use those weapons. This class is the modern working class — the proletarians
- The more the capital of the capitalists, the more numerous the proletariat becomes. <!-- , the modern working class, developed — a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital.  -->
- These labourers are a commodity and are consequently exposed to competition and fluctuations of the market.
- Because of mechanization, their work loses all individual character and all charm for the worker.

<!-- Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all , and, consequently, .  -->

  - He becomes an appendage of the machine doing the simplest, most monotonous task

This is why his wages are restricted to the price of maintaining him according to his means of subsistence and the propagation of his race. 

<!-- But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery, etc. -->

Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. 

Masses of labourers crowd into the factory and organised like soldiers, obeying a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. 

They are slaves of:
- the capitalist class
- the capitalist State
- the machine
- the supervisor
- the capitalist manufacturer himself. 

<!-- The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is. -->

The more modern industry becomes, the less strength is needed in manual labour, the more the labor of men are superseded by that of women. 
- Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. 
- Everyone becomes instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

The exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer ends when the laborer earns his cash wages. That is when the exploitation by the other parts of the capitalists, as the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc., begins. 

The lower strata of the middle class is made up of;
- small retailers 
- small manufactuerers and handicraftsmen 
- small farmers

These sink gradually into the proletariat because of:
- their small capital cannot compete with the large capital of Modern Industry
- their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. 

<!-- Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population. -->

In the beginning, the proletariat struggle with the capitalists:
- by individual labourers, 
- then by factory workers
- then by those of one locality

They destroy imported wares, machinery, and factories.  <!-- they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages. -->

<!-- At this stage, the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the capitalists, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial capitalist, the petty capitalist. Thus, the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the capitalists; every victory so obtained is a victory for the capitalists. -->

The proletariat increases in number with the development of industry and becomes more concentrated,
- This leads to organized riots. 

<!--  its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the capitalist, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual capitalist take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon, the workers begin to form combinations (Trades’ Unions) against the capitalist; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there, the contest breaks out into riots. -->

<!-- Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry, and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern proletarian, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years. -->

The proletarians then become a class, and, consequently a political party. 
- They lobby for better laws, such as the ten-hours’ bill in England.

<!-- , is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the capitalists itself. Thus, -->

This leads to a class struggle.  

<!-- Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The capitalists finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the capitalists itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the capitalists of foreign countries. In all these battles, it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The capitalists itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the capitalists.

Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling class are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.

Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the capitalists, so now a portion of the capitalists goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the capitalist ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole. -->
