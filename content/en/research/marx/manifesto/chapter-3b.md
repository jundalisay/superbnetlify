## C. German or “True” Socialism

The Socialist and Communist literature of France began as a fight against the capitalists in power. 
- This literature was introduced into Germany when the German capitalists had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.

German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits (men of letters), eagerly seized on this literature. 
- They forgot that when these writings came from French social conditions which did not immigrate with them. 

Under German social conditions, this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance.
- It became purely literary. 

Thus, to the German philosophers of the 18th Century:
- the demands of the first French Revolution were just the demands of “Practical Reason” in general
- the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French capitalists signified, to them, the laws of pure Will, as true human Will generally.

<!-- The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view. -->

This annexation happened in the same way that a foreign language is appropriated by translation.

<!-- It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote “Alienation of Humanity”, and beneath the French criticism of the capitalist state they wrote “Dethronement of the Category of the General”, and so forth. -->

The introduction of French philosophical phrases<!--  at the back of the French historical criticisms -->, the Germans dubbed as:
- “Philosophy of Action”
- “True Socialism”
- “German Science of Socialism”
- “Philosophical Foundation of Socialism”, etc.

The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. 

<!-- And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome “French one-sidedness” and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.

This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence. -->

Instead of it, the fight of <!-- the Germans, and especially of --> the Prussian capitalists against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, became more earnest. 
- This was the liberal movement.

<!-- By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to  Socialism of confronting the political movement with  -->

The “True” Socialist demands were: 
- fighting liberalism
- going against representative government
- going against capitalism
<!--  competition and capitalist freedom of the press, capitalist legislation, capitalist liberty and equality, and of  -->
- preaching to the masses that they had everything to lose from this capitalist movement. 

German Socialism was the silly echo of Feudal French anti-capitalism. 

 criticism, whose  it was, presupposed the existence of modern capitalist society, with its corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.

To the absolute governments, True Socialism served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening capitalists.

<!-- It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings. -->

The monarchial government used this “True” Socialism as a weapon against the German capitalists. 
- At the same time, it directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of German Philistines. 

In Germany, the petty-capitalist class:
- was a relic of the 16th century -- since then, it had constantly cropped up under the various forms. 
- is the real social cause of the existing state of things.
  - To preserve the petty-capitalist class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. 

The industrial and political supremacy of the capitalists threatens Germany with certain destruction either by:
- the concentration of capital, or
- the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. 

“True” Socialism appeared to kill these 2 birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.

<!-- The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry “eternal truths”, all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public. -->

German Socialism recognised gradually its own calling as the bombastic representative of petty-capitalism.
- It proclaimed:
  - Germany as the model nation
  - the German petty-capitalist as the typical man. 

<!-- To every villainous meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the “brutally destructive” tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.(3) -->

 

## 2. Conservative or Capitalist Socialism


Some capitalists want to redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of capitalist society.

To this group belong:
- economists
- philanthropists
- humanitarians
- improvers of the condition of the working class
- organisers of charity
- members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals
- temperance fanatics
- hole-and-corner reformers

<!-- . This form of socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems. -->

Proudhon’s *Philosophie de la Misère* is an example of this form.

The Socialistic capitalist:
- wants all the advantages of modern social conditions, without the struggles and dangers that capitalism creates.
- wants the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. 
- wants a capitalism without a proletariat. 
- The capitalists naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best

Capitalist Socialism develops system for this. 
- It requires the proletariat to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem.
- In reality, it really requires the proletariat to:
  - remain within the bounds of existing society and
  - cast away all its hate against the capitalists.

A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism tried to depreciate every revolutionary working class movement. 
- It did this by showing that only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical relations, were useful to them, and not mere political reform.
  - This form of Socialism, thus, does not understand that the abolition of the capitalist relations of production can only happen through a revolution. 
  - Instead, it pushes for administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations.
  - But these reforms merely lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of capitalist government.

<!-- reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best,  -->

Capitalist Socialism is only a mere figure of speech. They say:
- "Free trade for the benefit of the working class."
- "Protective duties for the benefit of the working class."
- "Prison Reform for the benefit of the working class."
  - This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of capitalist socialism.

It is summed up in the phrase: Capitalism for the benefit of the working class.
