Even the most radical flare up at our call to abolish the family. 

The capitalist family:
- is based on capital and private gain. 
- will vanish with the vanishing of capital.

<!-- In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the capitalists. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.

The capitalist family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital. -->

We want to stop the exploitation of children by their parents. 

You say that we destroy the most sacred of relations by replacing home education by social education.

But we did not invent education outside of the home. We merely want to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.

<!-- And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to --> 

<!-- The capitalist clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of  -->

Modern Industry destroys all the family ties among the proletarians. 
- Their children become child-laborers 

Do you want to continue such a disgusting relation?

We Communists will not introduce a community of women, because it already has been existing<!-- screams the capitalists in chorus -->.

The capitalist sees his wife and women as mere instruments of production. <!-- He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. -->

<!-- He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production. -->

For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our capitalist at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.

The capitalist take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives. They are not content with:
- having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, and
- common prostitutes.

Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common. 

 and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, 

We want to introduce an openly legalised community of women. The abolition of the capitalist system will lead to the abolition of prostitution.


## Abolition of Nationality

We want to abolish countries and nationality.

This is because:
- working men have no country. <!-- We cannot take from them what they have not got. --> 
- the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy
- the proletariat is the majority of every nation

<!-- , must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the capitalist sense of the word. -->


The development created by the capitalists leads to:
- freedom of commerce,
- the world market,
- uniformity in the mode of production
- the conditions of life.

Thanks to these, national differences and antagonism between peoples are vanishing daily more and more. 
- The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. 

**United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.**

The exploitation of one nation by another end in the same way that the exploitation of one person by another will also end. 
- This will lead to the ending of the hostility of one nation to another


## Abolition of Religion

The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.

Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?

What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.

When people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.

The ancient religions were replaced by Christianity
Christian ideas were replaced by rationalist ideas from the then revolutionary capitalists


The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.

“Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral, philosophical, and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.”

“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.”

What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.

But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.

The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.



The first step in the revolution by the working class is to make the proletariat the ruling class<!--  to win the battle of democracy -->.
- The proletariat will use its political supremacy to gradually:
  - wrest all capital from the capitalists
  - centralise all production in the hands of the State in order to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.

This cannot be done by despotically abolishing property rights, and on the conditions of capitalist production.
- We have to entirely revolutionize the mode of production

<!-- ; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of . -->

These measures will be different in different countries.

Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.

1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State
  - The cultivation of waste-lands
  - The improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
8. Equal liability of all to work. 
  - Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries
  - Gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.
10. Free education for all children in public schools.
  - Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form.
  - Combination of education with industrial production, etc.


In time:
- class distinctions will disappear
- all production will be concentrated in the State
- the public power will lose its political character
- the proletariat, as the ruling class, will eventually abolish its own supremacy as a class, and all classes generally

<!-- Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the capitalists is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. -->

Classes will be replaced by association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.




<!-- 1. By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour.

By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition]

2. That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing previous to recorded history, all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1881) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886. [Engels, 1888 English Edition and 1890 German Edition (with the last sentence omitted)]

3. Guild-master, that is, a full member of a guild, a master within, not a head of a guild. [Engels, 1888 English Edition]

4. This was the name given their urban communities by the townsmen of Italy and France, after they had purchased or conquered their initial rights of self-government from their feudal lords. [Engels, 1890 German edition]

“Commune” was the name taken in France by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local self-government and political rights as the “Third Estate.” Generally speaking, for the economical development of the capitalists, England is here taken as the typical country, for its political development, France. [Engels, 1888 English Edition]
