Of all the classes that stand face to face with the capitalists today, the proletariat alone is revolutionary. 
- The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry
- The proletariat is its special and essential product.

The lower middle class is made up the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant. 
- These fight against the capitalists and are conservative or even reactionary, not revolutionary. 

<!-- Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance, they are revolutionary, they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat. -->

<!-- The “dangerous class”, [lumpenproletariat] the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue. -->

In the condition of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. 

The proletarian:
- does not have property
- his relation to his wife and children are very different from the capitalist family relations
- can only be a master of the productive forces of society by abolishing all other modes of appropriation

<!--  modern industry labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many capitalist prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many capitalist interests. -->

<!-- All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation.  -->



<!-- , and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property. -->

<!-- All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, -->

The struggle of the proletariat with the capitalists is at first a national struggle.
- The proletariat of each country must first settle matters with its own capitalists.
- This is similar to a civil war

<!-- In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the capitalists lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. -->

<!-- Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. 

The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty capitalist, under the yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a capitalist. The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the capitalists is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this capitalists, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society. -->

The power of the capitalist class lies in the formation and augmentation of capital.
- The condition for capital is wage-labour.
- Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers. 

<!-- The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the capitalists, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association.  -->

The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation of the power of the capitalists. <!-- produces and appropriates products.  -->

The capitalists therefore produces its own grave-diggers.
-  Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.

1. “This proposition,” I wrote in the preface to the English translation, “which, in my opinion, is destined to do for history what Darwin’ s theory has done for biology, we both of us, had been gradually approaching for some years before 1845. How far I had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my Conditions of the Working Class in England. But when I again met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it already worked out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which I have stated it here.” [Note by Engels to the German edition of 1890]

2. Lassalle personally, to us, always acknowledged himself to be a disciple of Marx, and, as such, stood on the ground of the Manifesto. But in his first public agitation, 1862-1864, he did not go beyond demanding co-operative workshops supported by state credit.

A. The first Russian translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party was made by Bakunin, who despite being one of Marx and Engels’ most pronounced opponents in the working class movement, saw the great revolutionary importance contained within the Manifesto. Published in Geneva in 1869 (printing it in Russia was impossible due to state censorship), Bakunin’s translation was not completely accurate, and was replaced a decade later by Plekhanov’s translation in 1882, for which both Marx and Engels wrote a preface.

B. A reference to the events that occurred in Russia after the assassination, on March, 1, 1881, of Emperor Alexander II by Narodnaya Volya members. Alexander III, his successor, was staying in Gatchina for fear of further terrorism.

C. The issue of 30 December 1871 of Woodhulls & Claiflin's weekly contained an exact copy of Helen Macfarlane's translation for the Red Republican but neither the Red Republican nor Helen Macfarlane were acknowledged.
