Mach tried to avoid assigning reality to a something not observable. Instead of an acceleration with reference to absolute space, he used all of the masses in the universe as reference.
<!-- He substituted in mechanics a mean acceleration with reference to  .  -->

But inertial resistance opposed to relative acceleration of distant masses presupposes action at a distance. Anyone who follows Mach will still end up with the ether as medium for the effects of inertia. But Mach's ether is different from the ether of Newton, Fresnel, and Lorentz.


<!-- But ; and as the modern physicist does not believe that he may accept this action at a distance, he comes back once more, if he follows Mach, to the ether, which has to serve . But this conception of the ether to which we are led by Mach's way of thinking  --> 

Mach's ether not only conditions the behaviour of inert masses, but is also conditioned in its state by them.

Mach's idea finds its full development in the ether of General Relativity which says that the metrical qualities of space-time: 
- differ in the different points of space-time
- are partly conditioned by the matter existing outside of the territory



Space is not physically empty. This is because:  
- Space and time have reciprocal relations
- "empty space" in its physical relation is neither homogeneous nor isotropic, compelling us to describe its state by ten functions (the gravitation potentials gμν), 


This makes the ether useful. But this ether is very different from that of the ether of the mechanical undulatory theory of light. 

The ether of General Relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities. But it helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events.


## Difference Between GR Ether and Lorentz Ether

The state of General Relativity (GR) Ether is at every place determined by connections with the matter and the state of the ether in neighbouring places. These are amenable to law in the form of differential equations. 

The Lorentzian ether in the absence of electromagnetic fields is:
- conditioned by nothing outside itself
- everywhere the same

The GR ether is transmuted conceptually into the ether of Lorentz if we substitute constants for the functions of space which describe the former, disregarding the causes which condition its state. 

Thus, the GR ether is the outcome of the Lorentzian ether, through relativation.

As to the part which the new ether is to play in the physics of the future we are not yet clear. 


The new ether determines the metrical relations in the space-time continuum, e.g. the configurative possibilities of solid bodies as well as the gravitational fields. 

But we do not know whether:
- it has an essential share in the structure of the electrical elementary particles constituting matter.
- it is only in the proximity of ponderable masses that its structure differs essentially from that of the Lorentzian ether
- the geometry of spaces of cosmic extent is approximately Euclidean. 

But we can assert by reason of the relativistic equations of gravitation that there must be a departure from Euclidean relations, with spaces of cosmic order of magnitude, if there exists a positive mean density, no matter how small, of the matter in the universe.

In this case, the universe must of necessity be spatially unbounded and of finite magnitude. Its magnitude is determined by the value of that mean density.

If we consider the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field from the standpoint of the ether hypothesis, we find a remarkable difference between the two. 

There can be no space nor any part of space without gravitational potentials; for these confer upon space its metrical qualities, without which it cannot be imagined at all. 

The existence of the gravitational field is inseparably bound up with the existence of space. On the other hand a part of space may very well be imagined without an electromagnetic field. Thus in contrast with the gravitational field, the electromagnetic field seems to be only secondarily linked to the ether, the formal nature of the electromagnetic field being as yet in no way determined by that of gravitational ether. 

From the present state of theory it looks as if the electromagnetic field, as opposed to the gravitational field, rests upon an entirely new formal motif, as though nature might just as well have endowed the gravitational ether with fields of quite another type, for example, with fields of a scalar potential, instead of fields of the electromagnetic type.

The elementary particles of matter are merely condensations of the electromagnetic field. This leads to two views of the universe:  
- gravitational ether (space)
- electromagnetic field (matter)

These two realities are completely separated from each other conceptually, although connected causally.

It would be a great advance if we could comprehend the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field together as one unified conformation. This would conclude the the epoch of theoretical physics founded by Faraday and Maxwell. It would remove the contrast between ether and matter. 

Through General Relativity*, the whole of physics would become a complete system of thought, like geometry, kinematics, and the theory of gravitation. 


> *Superphysics Note: Such a unification is actually being prevented by General Relativity


<!-- An exceedingly ingenious attempt in this direction has been made by  -->

The mathematician H. Weyl is trying to do this. But I do not think that his theory will hold in reality. <!-- Further, in contemplating the immediate future of theoretical physics  -->

We should not unconditionally reject the possibility that the facts comprised in the quantum theory may set bounds to the field theory beyond which it cannot pass.

According to GR, space has physical qualities represented by the ether. 

<!-- According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense.  -->

But this ether is not a ponderable media which has parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.
