<!-- An Address delivered on May 5th, 1920, in the University of Leyden -->

<!-- How does it come about that alongside of the idea of ponderable matter, which is derived by abstraction from everyday life, the physicists set the idea of the existence of another kind of matter, the ether?  -->

The idea of the ether comes from:
- the theory of action at a distance
- the properties of light which have led to the undulatory theory

Outside of physics, we know nothing of action at a distance*. 



> *Superphysics note: This is false because most actions in metaphysics are actions at a distance.

<!-- When we try to connect cause and effect in the experiences which natural objects afford us, it seems at first as if -->

It seems to us that there are only <!--  were no other mutual --> actions <!-- than those --> of immediate contact:
- collision
- push and pull
- heating or inducing combustion by means of a flame, etc. 



Weight is <!-- Even in everyday experience weight, which is in a sense --> action at a distance. It plays a very important part. 

But since we experience weight constantly <!-- , something not linked to any cause which is variable in time or place, --> we do not <!--  in everyday life --> speculate as to the cause of gravity. Therefore we do not become conscious of it as action at a distance.

Newton's theory of gravitation first assigned a cause for gravity as <!-- f by interpreting it as action at a distance, proceeding --> comming from masses. <!-- Newton's theory is probably the greatest stride ever made in the effort towards the causal nexus of natural phenomena. And --> Yet this theory evoked discomfort among Newton's contemporaries, because conflicts with the principle from the rest of experience that reciprocal action is only through contact. <!-- , and not through immediate action at a distance. -->

<!-- It is only with reluctance that man's desire for knowledge endures a dualism of this kind.  -->

<!-- How was unity to be preserved in his comprehension of the forces of nature? Either by trying to look upon -->


### Contact Forces vs Action at a Distance 

This means that either:
- contact forces are really distant forces at small distances. This is what Netwonians favored. <!--  which admittedly are observable only at a very small distance and this was the road which Newton's followers, who were entirely under the spell of his doctrine, mostly preferred to take; or --> 
- Newtonian action at a distance [gravity] is really contact from afar, merely conveyed by a medium permeating space<!-- , whether by movements or by elastic deformation of this medium. --> This led to the ether hypothesis. 

<!-- Thus, the desire for a unified view of forces leads to the hypothesis of an ether.  -->

The ether hypothesis did not at first bring with it any theory of gravitation*.<!-- Or in physics generally, so that  --> It became customary to treat Newton's law of force as an axiom not further reducible. 

But the ether hypothesis was bound always to play some part in physical science, even if at first only a latent part.


> *Superphysics Note: Wrong. Descartes' aether, Kepler's aether, and even Timaeus aether all describe gravity. They merely don't call it as gravity, which is a word invented by Newton


<!--  the far-reaching similarity was revealed which subsists between the properties of light and those of ,  -->

The ether hypothesis found fresh support in the first half of the 19th century when light was proven to be elastic waves in ponderable bodies.

Light became a vibratory process in an elastic, inert medium filling up universal space, capable of polarisation that this medium. It follows that the ether must be a solid body because transverse waves are not possible in a fluid, but only in a solid. 

This led to the theory of the "quasi-rigid" luminiferous ether. Relatively to one another, it only carried the small movements of deformation which correspond to light-waves.

<!-- This theory — also called the theory of the stationary luminiferous ether — moreover found a strong support in an experiment which is also of fundamental importance in the special theory of relativity, the 
 -->

Fizeau's experiment are fundamental to both the ether and to Special Relativity. It showed that <!--  of , from which one was obliged to infer that the luminiferous --> the ether does not take part in the movements of bodies. The phenomenon of aberration also favoured the theory of the quasi-rigid ether.

Maxwell and Lorentz developed the theory of electricity which gave an unexpected turn to the ether.<!--   along the path opened up by  gave the development of our ideas concerning the ether quite a peculiar and .  -->

For Maxwell, the ether still had purely mechanical properties, although much more complicated than the mechanical properties of tangible solid bodies. 

But neither Maxwell nor his followers could elaborate a mechanical model for the ether which might furnish a satisfactory mechanical interpretation of Maxwell's laws of the electro-magnetic field. 

The laws were clear and simple, the mechanical interpretations clumsy and contradictory. 

<!-- Almost imperceptibly the theoretical physicists adapted themselves to a situation which, from the standpoint of their mechanical programme, was very depressing.  -->

They were influenced by the electro-dynamical investigations of Heinrich Hertz. 

Before Hertz, the conclusive theory only demanded <!-- that it should content itself with the fundamental concepts which belong exclusively to --> mechanics-concepts (e.g. densities, velocities, deformations, stresses). They gradually admitted electric and magnetic force as fundamental concepts side by side with those of mechanics, without requiring a mechanical interpretation for them. 

Thus the purely mechanical view of nature was gradually abandoned*.


> *Superphysics note: This led to wave-particle duality 


This led to a fundamental dualism which was insupportable in the long-run. <!-- A way of escape was now sought in the reverse direction, by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity, and this especially as confidence in  --> The strict validity of <!-- the equations of --> Newton's mechanics was shaken by the experiments with β-rays and rapid cathode rays.

<!-- This dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form  -->

In the theory of Hertz, matter is:
- the bearer of velocities, kinetic energy, and mechanical pressures, and
- electromagnetic fields which also occur in vacuo (in free ether)

This means that the ether also bears electromagnetic fields. It is thus indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter*.


> *Superphysics Note: This is the earth-aether (Stokes' aether)


Within matter, it takes part in the motion of matter. In empty space, it has a velocity everywhere*. 


> *Superphysics Note: This is the fire-aether (Lorentz aether) and the air-aether (Descartes aether) 


In this way, it has a definite velocity throughout space. There is no fundamental difference between Hertz's ether and ponderable matter (which in part subsists in the ether).

The Hertz theory was wrong in ascribing mechanical states and electrical states to matter and ether because I thin they have no relation to each other. It was also at variance with Fizeau's experiment on the speed of light in moving fluids<!-- , and with other established experimental results -->.

Then, H. A. Lorentz entered the scene and simplified the theory. 

He harmonized the ether theory with experience through a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles. 
- This was the most important advance in the theory of electricity since Maxwell.

He achieved this by taking from ether its mechanical qualities, and from matter its electromagnetic qualities. 

The ether in empty space and inside matter  <!-- As in empty space, so too in the interior of material bodies, , and not matter viewed atomistically, --> was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields. 

According to Lorentz, only the elementary particles of matter can carry out movements. Their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges. Thus, Lorentz reduced all electromagnetic happenings to Maxwell's equations for free space.

The only mechanical nature of the Lorentzian ether is its immobility. Special Relativity removed this immobility.

<!--  , it may be said of it, in a somewhat playful spirit, that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by H. A. Lorentz. It may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether  brought about, consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality, namely, its . How this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded. -->
