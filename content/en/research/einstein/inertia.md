I combined
- the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space
- the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space
- my principle of relativity: The changing states of physical systems are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of coordinates, in uniform motion of
parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred.

Let a system of plane waves of light, referred to the system of co-ordinates (x, y, z), possess the energy l; 

Let the direction of the ray (the wave-normal) make an angle φ with the axis of x of the system. 

If we introduce a new system of coordinates (ξ, η, ζ) moving in uniform parallel translation with respect to the system (x, y, z), and having its origin of co-ordinates in motion along the
axis of x with the velocity v, then this quantity of light—measured in the system (ξ, η, ζ)—possesses the energy l
∗ = l 1 − v c cosφ p 1 − v 2/c2

where c denotes the speed of light. 

Let there be a stationary body in the system (x, y, z), and let its energy—referred to the system (x, y, z) be E0. 

Let the energy of the body relative to the system (ξ, η, ζ) moving as above with the velocity v, be H0.

Let this body send out, in a direction making an angle φ with the axis of x, plane waves of light, of energy 1

L measured relatively to (x, y, z), and simultaneously an equal quantity of light in the opposite direction. Meanwhile
the body remains at rest with respect to the system (x, y, z). 

The principle of ∗The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is in Maxwell’s equations.

Energy must apply to this process, and in fact (by the principle of relativity) with respect to both systems of co-ordinates. If we call the energy of the body
after the emission of light E1 or H1 respectively, measured relatively to the system (x, y, z) or (ξ, η, ζ) respectively, then by employing the relation given
above we obtain

By subtraction we obtain from these equations H0 − E0 − (H1 − E1) = L (1 p

```

The two differences of the form H − E occurring in this expression have simple physical significations. 

H and E are energy values of the same body referred to two systems of co-ordinates which are in motion relatively to each other,
the body being at rest in one of the two systems (system (x, y, z)). 

Thus it is clear that the difference H − E can differ from the kinetic energy K of the body, with respect to the other system (ξ, η, ζ), only by an additive constant C, which
depends on the choice of the arbitrary additive constants of the energies H and E. 

Thus we may place

H0 − E0 = K0 + C,
H1 − E1 = K1 + C,

since C does not change during the emission of light. So we have

```
K0 − K1 = L (
1
p
1 − v
2/c2
− 1
)
```

The kinetic energy of the body with respect to (ξ, η, ζ) diminishes as a result of the emission of light, and the amount of diminution is independent of the
properties of the body. Moreover, the difference K0 −K1, like the kinetic energy of the electron (§ 10), depends on the velocity.
Neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orders we may place 

```
K0 − K1 =
1

L

```

From this equation it directly follows that:

If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c2

The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general
conclusion that The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content.

If the energy changes by L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 × 1020, the energy being
measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes.

It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-content is variable to a high degree (e.g. with radium salts) the theory may be successfully put to the
test.

If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies.



### About this Document

This edition of Einstein’s Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy-Content is based on the English translation of his original 1905 Germanlanguage paper (published as Ist die Tr¨agheit eines K¨orpers von seinem Energiegehalt abh¨angig?, in Annalen der Physik. 18:639, 1905) which appeared
in the book The Principle of Relativity, published in 1923 by Methuen and Company, Ltd. of London. Most of the papers in that collection are English
translations by W. Perrett and G.B. Jeffery from the German Das Relativatsprinzip, 4th ed., published by in 1922 by Tuebner. All of these sources are
now in the public domain; this document, derived from them, remains in the public domain and may be reproduced in any manner or medium without
permission, restriction, attribution, or compensation. 

The footnote is as it appeared in the 1923 edition. The 1923 English translation modified the notation used in Einstein’s 1905 paper to conform
to that in use by the 1920’s; for example, c denotes the speed of light, as opposed the V used by Einstein in 1905. In this paper Einstein uses L to
denote energy; the italicised sentence in the conclusion may be written as the equation “m = L/c2
” which, using the more modern E instead of L to denote energy, may be trivially rewritten as “E = mc2
”
