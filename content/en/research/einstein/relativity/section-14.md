Our experience shows that:
- the principle of relativity holds true, and
- the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant `c` 

By uniting these two postulates, we obtained:
- the law of transformation for co-ordinates `x, y, z` and
- the time `t` of the events in nature

This led to the Lorentz transformation and not the Galilei transformation of classical mechanics. **The constant speed of light played an important part in this.** Through the Lorentz transformation, we can combine this nature of light with the principle of relativity. We sum up the theory thus= 

{{< q a="ein" >}} 
Every general law of nature* is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the spacetime variables `x, y, z, t` of the original non-moving coordinate system `K`, we introduce new space-time variables `x', y', z', t'` of a moving coordinate system `K'`.

> *Superphysics Note: This part of Relativity is correct. The error is in basing it in the constancy of light



The relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. In other words: **General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.**

This is a definite mathematical condition that my theory of relativity demands of a natural law. This makes my theory a valuable heuristic aid in the search for the general laws of nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved*.


<!-- Let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced.

> *Superphysics Note: We easily disprove Einstein's theory with the levitating Buddhist monk, the levitating of ancient Egyptian blocks as the pyramids, and the zipping of UFOs through spacetime without needing immense amounts of energy. His theory only works in the electromagnetic layer and not in the material layer (where principles of Classical mechanics works) or the spacetime and aethereal layers (where the principles of Superphysics works)
