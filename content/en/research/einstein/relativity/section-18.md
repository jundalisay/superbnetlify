<!-- PART II THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY -->

Special Relativity is the principle of the physical relativity of all **uniform motion**. <!-- From the point of view of the idea it conveys to us, --> Every motion must only be considered as a relative motion. In our earler train example: 

<!-- Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are equally justifiable=   -->

1. The train is in motion relative to the embankment. Our <!-- reference-body --> viewpoint in this case is the embankment
2. The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage. Our viewpoint in this case is the train

For *theoretical* descriptions of motion, we do not care which viewpoint <!-- reference-body --> we take.

This is true for Special Relativity, but not for General Relativity. 

But for *real* descriptions of motion, the laws of physics have the exactly the same form in both cases when= 

1. The embankment is our viewpoint
2. The train is our viewpoint


<!-- Both the embankment and the train carriage is the viewpoint  body of reference in our statement of relative motion.  -->

<!--  taking place. If it is simply a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in principle immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. 

As already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused with the much more comprehensive statement called “the principle of relativity,” which we have taken as the basis of our investigations. -->

<!-- Relativity says that we can choose either viewpoint of the train or the embankment. Thus, all the -->  <!-- The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is
self-evident).  --> <!-- Our principle rather asserts what follows=  If we formulate the  --> general laws of nature use <!--  as they are obtained from experience, by making use of -->
<!-- - the embankment as reference-body,
- the railway carriage as reference-body, -->

<!-- then these general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the law of the propagation of light
in vacuo) have exactly the same form in both cases.  -->

**This means that in the real world<!-- description of natural processes -->, neither of the viewpoints `K, K'` are unique as compared with the other.** Unlike the first, this latter statement <!-- need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of “motion” and “reference-body” and derivable from them; --> is only proven by experience<!--  can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness -->.

Up to now, however, we did not say that **all** viewpoints or bodies of reference `K` are equal in terms of real motion. <!--  in connection with the formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following lines.  -->

First, we assumed that there exists a viewpoint `K` that is bound to the Galileian law: A particle left to itself <!-- and sufficiently far removed from all other particles --> moves uniformly in a straight line. <!-- With reference to K (Galileian reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible.  --> <!-- But in addition to `K`, --> All viewpoints or bodies of reference `K'` added to `K`:
- should be given preference
- should be exactly equivalent to `K` for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to `K`. 

All these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian viewpoints. <!-- reference-bodies.  --> Special Relativity is valid only for these reference-bodies, but not for others which have a different kind of motion. 

<!-- In this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity. -->

In contrast to this is General Relativity=  **All bodies of reference `K`, `K'`, etc., are equivalent for the <!-- description of natural phenomena ( -->formulation of the general laws of nature, whatever their state of motion.**

General Relativity is more abstract than Special Relativity. <!-- This formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one, for reasons which will become evident later. --> People will be more curious about General Relativity. 

<!-- Since Special Relativity has been justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step towards General Relativity.  -->

<!-- But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is
little hope of success in such an attempt. --> 

A train travels at a uniform rate. Its occupant is not sensible of its motion. This is why he can say that the train is at rest, but the embankment is in motion. This is acceptable to Special Relativity.  <!-- Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view. -->

If the train's motion becomes erratic, such as if it hits the brakes, <!--  of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes --> then its occupant jerks forward. This leads to mechanical behaviour of objects relative to him inside the train. 

<!--  experiences correspondingly erratic mechanical movements --><!--  powerful jerk forwards --> <!-- The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage.  -->This mechanical behaviour is different from the behavior of those objects before the brakes were applied. <!--  of the previous case. --> This is why <!--  previously considered, and for this reason --> it is impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the erratically-moving train, as when it is at <!--  hold with reference to the carriage when at --> rest or in uniform motion.


The Galileian law does not hold with respect to the erratically-moving train. This is why we feel compelled to grant an absolute physical reality* to erratic motion in Newtonian Physics, which is different from General Relativity. <!-- But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained. -->
