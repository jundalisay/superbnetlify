What is the distance between the points `A` and `B` in the train in Section 9?

We need a body of reference to measure it. 

<!-- It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as the reference-body (co-ordinate system).  -->

- If our viewpoint is the train, then a man in the train measures the distance by using his measuring-rod to mark the distance on the floor as many times as is needed to take him from `A` to `B`.
- If our viewpoint is the embankment, then we measure `A'` and `B'` at time `t` using the definition of time at Section 8. The distance between `A` and `B` is gotten by the repeated application of the measuring-rod along the embankment.

These two measurements will not be the same. This means that the train as measured from the embankment may be different from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. 

This leads to a second objection to Section 6=  the man walking in the train covers the distance `w` in a unit of time measured from the train. This distance as measured from the embankment is not necessarily equal to `w`.

<!-- Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance. -->

<!-- It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. 

If we call `A'` and `B'` the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both of these points are -->

<!-- e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage.
moving with the velocity v along the embankment.

In the first place we require to determine the points A and B of the embankment which are just being passed by the two points A' and B' at a particular time t â€” judged from the embankment. 

These points A and B of the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time given in Section 8.  -->
