I place a metre-rod in the x'-axis of moving `K'` in a way that its beginning coincides with the point `x' = 0` while its end  coincides with the point `x' = 1`. 

What is the length of the metre rod relative to the non-moving `K`? 

This is answered by asking where the beginning and end of the rod lie with respect to non-moving `K` at a time `t` of non-moving `K`. The first equation of the Lorentz transformation shows that the values of these two points at the time `t = 0` is:

``` elixir
x (beginning of rod) = 0 √ (1 − (v2/c2) 

x (end of rod) = 1 √ (1 − (v2/c2)
```

the distance between the points being= 

``` elixir
√ (1-(v2/c2))
```

But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity `v` relative to non-moving `K`. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity `v` is:

``` elixir
√1 − (v2/c2) 
```

of a metre.

The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the velocity `v = c`  we should have:

``` elixir
√ (1 − (v2/c2)) = 0
```

For faster speeds, the square-root becomes imaginary. This means that in the theory of relativity, the velocity `c` plays the part of a limiting velocity, **which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body**. 

This `c` follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation. These become meaningless if `v` becomes greater than `c`.

If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the x-axis with respect to non-moving `K`, then the length of the rod as viewed from `K'` would have been `1 − v 2 c 2`. This is in accordance with my principle of relativity.<!--  which forms the basis of our considerations.  -->

<!-- A priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for  -->

The magnitudes `x, y, z, t`, are merely the results of measurements of the measuring-rods and clocks. If we used Galilei transformation, the rod would not contract as a consequence of its motion.

Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin `(x' = 0 )` of `K'`. `t' = 0` and `t' = 1` are two successive ticks of this clock. The 1st and 4th equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks=  `t = 0` and

``` elixir
t = 1 / √ (1-(v2/c2))
```

As judged from non-moving `K`, the clock is moving with the velocity `v` as judged from this viewpoint, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not 1 second, but

``` elixir
1 / √(1-(v2/c2))
```

seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion, the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity `c` plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.
