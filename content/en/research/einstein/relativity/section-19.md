<!-- If drop a stone, why does it fall to the ground?” 

The usual is that it is attracted by the earth. 

Modern physics has a slightly different answer. -->

An action at a distance must have some intermediary medium. 
<!-- As a result of the more careful study
of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to
regard action at a distance as a process impossible
without the intervention of 
medium.  -->

A magnet that attracts a piece of iron does not do so in empty space, but through a magnetic field, as per Faraday. 
- In its turn, this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the iron moves towards the magnet. 
<!--  we cannot be content to regard this
as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the
iron through the intermediate empty space, but
we are constrained to imagine — after the manner
of Faraday — that the magnet always calls
into being something physically real in the space
around it, that something being what we call a
“magnetic field.”  -->

This idea is arbitrary. Nevertheless, it represents electromagnetic phenomena and is applied to the transmission of electromagnetic waves.

The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner.
- The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. 
- The earth produces a gravitational field which acts on the stone and causes it to fall. 
- The intensity of this diminishes according to a definite law as we move farther away from the earth. 

From our point of view this means that the law governing the gravitational field in space must be perfectly definite. <!-- , in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies.  -->

The earth produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood directly. {{< c v="red" >}} The field's intensity and direction at farther areas are thence determined by the law which governs the properties of **the space** of the gravitational fields themselves.{{< /c >}}

In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field <!-- exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance for what follows.  --> makes bodies accelerate. <!-- Bodies solely affected by the influence of gravity accelerate. --> This acceleration does not depend at all on that body's material or its physical state. A piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same way. <!-- manner in a
gravitational field (in vacuo), when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity.  -->

<!-- This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in the light of the following consideration. -->

According to Newton’s 2nd law of motion, this is:

``` elixir
Force = inertial mass × acceleration
```


The “inertial mass” is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body. 

If gravity caused the acceleration, we then have:

``` elixir
Force = gravitational mass × intensity of the gravitational field
```


The “gravitational mass” is also a characteristic constant for the body. From these, two relations follows:

``` elixir
acceleration = (gravitational mass / inertial mass) × intensity of the gravitational field
```


If the acceleration were independent of the nature of the body and always the same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all bodies. 

We then make both types of mass the same as a law: <!--  By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal to unity. We then have the following law=  -->

{{< q a="newton" >}}
The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass.
{{< /q >}}

This means that weight is inertia and vice versa. 

<!-- It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact=  The same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as “inertia” or as “weight” (lit. “heaviness”).  -->

<!-- In the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually the case, and how this question is connected with the general postulate of relativity.
