Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment simultaneously at two places `A` and `B` far distant from each other. 
- A meteorologist discovered that the lightning must always strike `A` and `B` simultaneously.

How do we test if the lightning really did strike the two places at the same time? What does "simultaneous" mean?

<!-- I make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If now I ask
you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question with a decided “Yes.”

But if I now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight. -->

<!-- After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you=  “The significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further
explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place simultaneously or not.”

I cannot be satisfied with this answer for the following reason.  -->


<!--  then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. -->

<!-- We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception “simultaneous” plays a part.  -->

<!-- The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously. 

As long as this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this point.) -->

<!-- After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity.  -->

We test simultaniety by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. 
- He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time
- **If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous [happen at the same time]**

> *Superphysics Note: Einstein's logical absurdity, which is the foundation of Relativity, is that if c, then c because c. Einstein thus puts all movement under the rule of c or the dynamics of light. The problem is that the two other layers of spacetime and aether are higher than light!


<!-- By measuring along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB.  -->

You object by saying that:
- "time" would only be "simultaniety" if light travels at a constant speed
- but the speed of light is measured by time

**You would say this is reasoning in a circle and therefore, simultaniety has absolutely nothing to do with light.**

<!-- I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled,
because I feel constrained to raise the following objection=  “Your definition would certainly be
right, if I only knew that the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning
flashes travels along the length A ~T M with the same velocity as along the length B ~T M. -->

<!-- But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle.” -->

<!-- After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me — and rightly so — and you declare=  “I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it  -->

<span style="color=  red"><b>I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.</b>  <!-- There is only one demand to be made of the definition of , namely, that in every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition satisfies this demand is indisputable.  -->  Light takes the same time to get from `A` to `M` and `B` to `M`. This is has nothing to do with the physical nature of light. It is something that I use to define simultaneity.</span>

This definition can be used to give an exact meaning to as many events as we want, independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of reference* (here the railway embankment). 

> *Einstein note: When three events `A`, `B`, and `C` happen in different places in such a manner that, if `A` is simultaneous with `B`, and `B` is simultaneous with `C`<!-- (simultaneous in the sense of the above definition) -->, then the criterion for the [light-]simultaneity of the pair of events `A, C` is also satisfied. This assumption is <!-- a physical hypothesis about the law of propagation of light; it must certainly be --> fulfilled because of <!-- if we are to maintain --> the law of the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum.


This is our defintion of time in physics. 

We assume clocks of identical construction are placed at the points A, B and C of the railway line (co-ordinate system). 
- The positions of their pointers are simultaneously the same. Under these conditions we understand by the “time” of an event the reading (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. 

In this way, a time-value is associated with every observable event. <!-- This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary. It has been assumed that  --> We assume all these clocks have the same construction as to go at the same rate. 

<!-- Stated more exactly=  -->Thus, when 2 clocks arranged at rest in different places of a reference-body are set so that a particular position of the pointers of Clock 1 is [light-]simultaneous with the same position of the pointers of Clock 2, then identical “settings” are always [light-]simultaneous.
