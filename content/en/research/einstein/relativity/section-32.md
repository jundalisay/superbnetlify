{{< c v="red" >}} According General Relativity (GR), the geometrical properties of space are determined by matter.{{< /c >}}

Thus, we can draw conclusions about the universe's geometrical structure based on <!-- the state of the --> matter.

<!-- We know from experience that, for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, -->

The velocities of the stars are small as compared with the speed of light. From this, we can conclude the nature of the universe. 

<!-- We can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at rest. -->

The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields caused by the distribution of matter. This eliminates the need for <!--  in itself is sufficient to exclude the possibility of the --> the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe. 

But our universe differs only slightly from a Euclidean one. <!-- This notion seems all the more probable, since --> This is proven by the outer space of our solar system <!-- calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is --> being influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even as large <!-- of the magnitude of --> as our sun.

We might imagine that <!-- , as regards geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane=  something --> our universe is like the rippled surface of a lake, as a <!-- . Such a universe might fittingly be called --> "quasi-Euclidean universe" which has infinite space.  <!-- As regards its space it would be infinite. --> But <!-- calculation shows that in --> such a quasi-Euclidean universe would have an average density of matter as nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere. <!-- ; it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in Section 30. -->

<!-- If we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the universe cannot be quasi-Euclidean.  -->

On the contrary, <!-- the results of calculation indicate that --> if matter were distributed uniformly, the universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). 

Since <!-- in reality the detailed --> the distribution of matter is not uniform, the real universe will not be totally spherical<!-- deviate in individual parts from the spherical -->. It will be quasi-spherical, but finite. In fact, GR <!-- the theory supplies us with a simple connection between --> connects the space-expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in it.

For the radius `R` of the universe we obtain the equation 

``` elixir
R^2 = 2 / κρ
```

The use of the C.G.S. system in this equation gives

``` elixir
2 / κ = = 1.08.10^27
```

`ρ` is the average density of the matter.
