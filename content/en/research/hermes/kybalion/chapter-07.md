"While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE ALL is in ALL. One who truly understands this has great knowledge."—The Kybalion.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- How often have the majority of people heard repeated the statement that their Deity (called by many names) was "All in All" and how little have they suspected the inner occult truth concealed by these carelessly uttered words? 

The commonly used expression is a survival of the ancient Hermetic Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: "To him who truly understands this truth, hath come great knowledge." And, this being so, let us seek this truth, the understanding of which means so much. In this statement of truth—this Hermetic Maxim—is concealed one of the greatest philosophical, scientific and religious truths. -->

<!-- We have given you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental Nature of the Universe—the truth that "the Universe is Mental—held in the Mind of THE ALL." As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: "All is in THE ALL." But note also the co-related statement, that: "It is equally true that THE ALL is in ALL." This apparently contradictory statement is reconcilable under the -->

The quote above leads to the Law of Paradox. 

<!-- It is, moreover, an exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and its Mental Universe. We have seen how "All is in THE ALL"—now let us examine the other aspect of the subject. -->

THE ALL is Inherent <!-- Imminent in ("remaining within; inherent; abiding within") --> in its Universe, as embodied in the Principle of Correspondence.

<!-- , and in every part, particle, unit, or combination, within the Universe. This statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the   -->

The student is told to form a Mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental form. <!-- , the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming an idea of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student will find that  -->

The image has its existence and being solely within his own mind. Yet the student, author, painter, or sculptor, is immanent in, remaining within, or abiding within the mental image also.

In other words, the entire virtue, life, spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the "immanent mind" of the thinker.


## Shakespeare

Let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear, Richard 3rd, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of their conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed within each of these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and action. 

Whose is the "spirit" of the characters that we know as Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah Heep? 

Is it Dickens, or have each of these characters a personal spirit, independent of their creator? 

Have the Venus of Medici, the Sistine Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and reality of their own, or do they represent the spiritual and mental power of their creators? 

The Law of Paradox explains that both propositions are true, viewed from the proper viewpoints.

Micawber is both Micawber and Dickens.

Micawber is Dickens, yet Dickens is not Micawber. 

Man, like Micawber, may say: "The Spirit of my Creator is inherent within me— and yet I am not HE!" 

The half-wise will say: "I am God!". 

Imagine each character in Shakespeare's plays eloquently announcing: "I Am Shakespeare!" 

THE ALL is in the earthworm, and in the particles that go to make up the earth-worm.. Yet the earth-worm is far from being THE ALL. 

<!-- And still the wonder remains, that though the earth-worm exists merely as a lowly thing, created and having its being solely within the Mind of THE ALL—yet 

THE ALL is immanent in the earthworm,  
 -->

<!-- Can there be any greater mystery than this of "All in THE ALL; and THE ALL in All?"

The student will, of course, realize that the illustrations given above are necessarily imperfect and inadequate, for they represent the creation of mental images in finite minds, while the Universe is a creation of Infinite Mind—and the difference between the two poles separates them. 

And yet it is merely a matter of degree—the same Principle is in operation—the Principle of Correspondence manifests in each—"As above, so Below; as Below, so above."

And, in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling Spirit immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale of life. This is what spiritual development means—the recognition, realization, and manifestation of the Spirit within us. Try to remember this last definition—that of spiritual development. It contains the Truth of True Religion. -->

There are many:
- planes of Being
- sub-planes of Life
- degrees of existence. 

All of these depend on the advancement of beings in the scale. 
- The lowest point is the grossest matter
- The highest point is being separated only by the thinnest division from the SPIRIT of THE ALL.

Upward and onward along this Scale of Life, everything is moving. 

All are on the Path, whose end is THE ALL. All progress is a Returning Home. All is Upward and Onward, in spite of all seemingly contradictory appearances.

<!-- The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental Creation of the Universe, are that --> 

At the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL<!-- , in its aspect of Being, --> projects its Will toward its aspect of "Becoming" and the process of creation begins. It lowers Its Vibration which then <!-- until a very low degree of vibratory energy is reached, at which point --> creates the grossest form of Matter. 

**This process is called the stage of Involution, in which THE ALL becomes "involved," or "wrapped up," in its creation.**

This is like the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so wrapped up in his mental creation as to:
- almost forget his own existence 
- almost "live in his creation" 

<!-- If instead of "wrapped" we use the word "rapt," perhaps we will give a better idea of what is meant. -->

This Involuntary stage of Creation is sometimes called the "Outpouring" of the Divine Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is called the "Indrawing." 

The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of the pendulum of Rhythm—a "coming home" idea being held in all of the Hermetic Teachings.

The Teachings are that during the "Outpouring," the vibrations become lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing begins. But there is this difference, that while in the "Outpouring" the creative forces manifest compactly and as a whole, yet from the beginning of the Evolutionary or "Indrawing" stage, there is manifested the Law of Individualization—that is, the tendency to separate into Units of Force, so that finally that which left THE ALL as unindividualized energy returns to its source as countless highly developed Units of Life, having risen higher and higher in the scale by means of Physical, Mental and Spiritual Evolution.

"Meditation" is the process of mentally creating the Universe in the Mind of THE ALL.

"Contemplation" is similar, except this emphasizes the Divine Attention. 

"Attention" means "to reach out or stretch out". Thus, attention is really a mental "reaching out; extension" of mental energy. <!-- , so that the underlying idea is readily understood when we examine into the real meaning of "Attention." -->

"Evolution" is when THE ALL has meditated Creation and has established the material foundations of the Universe, and then awakens from its Meditation. It "evolves" from the material, mental, and spiritual planes. 

<!-- Thus, the upward movement begins—and all begins to move Spiritward.  -->

In evolution:
- Matter becomes less gross
- the Units spring into being
- the combinations begin to form
- Life appears and manifests in higher and higher forms
- Mind becomes more and more in evidence—the vibrations constantly becoming higher. 

In short, the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases, begins, and proceeds according to the established "Laws of the Indrawing" process. 

All of this occupies aeons upon aeons of Man's time, each aeon containing countless millions of years, but yet the Illumined inform us that the entire creation, including Involution and Evolution, of an Universe, is but "as the twinkle of the eye" to THE ALL. 

At the end of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE ALL withdraws its Attention—its Contemplation and Meditation—of the Universe, for the Great Work is finished. 

All is withdrawn into THE ALL from which it emerged. 

But Mystery of Mysteries—the Spirit of each soul is not annihilated, but is infinitely expanded—the Created and the Creator are merged. 

The above illustration of the "meditation," and subsequent "awakening from meditation," of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the teachers to describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet: "As Below, so Above." 

The difference is merely in degree. And just as THE ALL arouses itself from the meditation upon the Universe, so does Man (in time) cease from manifesting upon the Material Plane, and withdraws himself more and more into the Indwelling Spirit, which is indeed "The Divine Ego."

<!-- There is one more matter of which we desire to speak in this lesson, and that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of speculation, although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such speculation. We allude to the question which inevitably comes to the mind of all thinkers who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question is:  -->


## The ALL Created the Universe for No Reason 

"WHY does THE ALL create Universes?" 

Some have imagined that:
- THE ALL had something to gain by it. 
  - But this is absurd, for what could THE ALL gain that it did not already possess? 
- THE ALL "wished something to love"
- THE ALL wanted pleasure or amusement
- THE ALL "was lonely"
- THE ALL wanted to show its power

These are all childish answers.

Others have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL found itself "compelled" to create, by reason of its own "internal nature"—its "creative instinct." 

This idea is in advance of the others, but its weak point lies in the idea of THE ALL being "compelled" by anything, internal or external. 

If its "internal nature," or "creative instinct," compelled it to do anything, then the "internal nature" or "creative instinct" would be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so accordingly that part of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does create and manifest, and seems to find some kind of satisfaction in so doing. 

And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some infinite degree it must have what would correspond to an "inner nature," or "creative instinct," in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and Will. 

It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would not Will to Act, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless it obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong to an "Inner Nature," and might be postulated as existing according to the Law of Correspondence. 

But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as acting entirely FREE from any influence, internal as well as external. That is the problem which lies at the root of difficulty—and the difficulty that lies at the root of the problem.

THE ALL has no "Reason" whatsoever for THE ALL to act since THE ALL is above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which time the Principle is set into motion. 

Thus, the matter is Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. 

Just as we say THE ALL merely "IS"—so we are compelled to say that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT ACTS." At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself; All Action in Itself—and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act—or still further, that THE ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same thing. 

In the opinion of those who are giving you these present lessons, the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL, along with its Secret of Being. The Law of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only to that aspect of THE ALL, which may be spoken of as "The Aspect of BECOMING." Back of that Aspect is "The Aspect of BEING" in which all Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE—and THE ALL; PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, ONE AND THE SAME. 

Therefore, Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile*. 


> *Superphysics note: The absence of the One is why the author ascribes no reason to existence


<!-- We go into the matter here, merely to show that we recognize the question, and also the absurdity of the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology. -->

Hermetic Teachers applied the Principle of Correspondence to answer the question with the result of the "Inner Nature" conclusion. When HERMES was asked this question by his advanced students, he gave no answer.  He meant that his advanced students did not possess the Understanding for the answer. 

<!-- answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY TOGETHER and saying not a word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then, he may have intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: "The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding," believing that even his  -->



<!--  which entitled them to the Teaching. At any rate, if Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to impart it, and so far as the world is concerned THE LIPS OF HERMES ARE CLOSED regarding it. And where the Great Hermes hesitated to speak, what mortal may dare to teach? -->

<!-- But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if indeed there be an answer the truth remains that: "While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE ALL is in All." The Teaching on this point is emphatic. And, we may add the concluding words of the quotation: "To him who truly understands this truth, hath come great knowledge."
