"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."—The Kybalion.
{{< /q >}}


The Principle of Vibration says that:
<!-- - Motion is manifest in everything in the Universe -->
- Nothing is at rest
- Everything moves, vibrates, and circles. 

This Principle was adopted by some of the early Greek philosophers in their systems. But, then, for centuries it forgotten. 

<!--  was lost sight of by the thinkers outside of the Hermetic ranks.  -->

But in the 19th Century science re-discovered this. In the 20th Century, scientific discoveries have added additional proof this truth.

Everything is in constant movement and vibration. **The "differences" between the various manifestations of the universal power are due entirely to the varying rate and mode of vibrations.**

Even THE ALL, in itself, is a constant vibration of such an infinite degree of intensity and rapid motion that it may be practically considered as at rest. 

An example is a rapidly revolving wheel which seems to be at rest. The Spirit is at one end of the Pole of Vibration, the other Pole being certain extremely gross forms of Matter. 

Between these two poles are millions upon millions of different rates and modes of vibration.

Modern Science has proven that all that we call Matter and Energy are but "modes of vibratory motion". The more advanced scientists are moving toward the positions of the occultists who hold that the phenomena of Mind are likewise modes of vibration or motion. 

<!-- Let us see what science has to say regarding the question of vibrations in matter and energy. -->

Science teaches that all matter manifests as the vibrations arising from temperature or heat. 

Cold or hot are both degrees of the same things. it manifests certain heat vibrations, and in that sense is in motion and vibration. Then all particles of Matter are in circular movement, from corpuscle to suns. 

The planets revolve around suns. Many of them turn on their axes. The suns move around greater central points, and these are believed to move around still greater, and so on, ad infinitum.

The molecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a state of constant vibration and movement around each other and against each other. The molecules are composed of Atoms, which, likewise, are in a state of constant movement and vibration. 

The atoms are composed of Corpuscles, sometimes called "electrons," "ions," etc., which also are in a state of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which manifest a very rapid state and mode of vibration. 

Thus, all forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic Principle of Vibration.

So it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that Light, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion connected in some way with, and probably emanating from the Ether. 

Science still is unable to explain the phenomena of:
- Cohesion which is the principle of Molecular Attraction
- Chemical Affinity which is the principle of Atomic Attraction
- Gravitation (the greatest mystery of the three), which is the principle of attraction by which every particle or mass of Matter is bound to every other particle or mass. 

These are merely manifestations of vibratory energy. <!-- , a fact which the Hermetists have held and taught for ages past. -->



Science has an idea The Universal Ether without its nature being understood clearly. The Hermetists see ether as "The Ethereal Substance", a higher manifestation of matter. 

This Ethereal Substance:
- is of extreme tenuity and elasticity
- pervades universal space as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc.
- is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory energy known as "Matter" on the one hand, and "Energy or Force" on the other
- manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and mode, entirely its own.

Scientists illustrate the effects of increasing rates of vibration through a rapidly revolving wheel, top, or cylinder. 

The wheel revolves slowly silently. 

<!-- . The illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a low rate of speed—we will call this revolving thing "the object" in following out the illustration. Let us suppose the object moving slowly. It may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.  -->

The speed is gradually increased until a deep growl or low note may be heard. As the rate is increased, the note rises one in the musical scale. Then, the motion being still further increased, the next highest note is distinguished. Then, one after another, all the notes of the musical scale appear, rising higher and higher as the motion is increased. 

Finally when the motions have reached a certain rate the final note perceptible to human ears is reached and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence follows. 

No sound is heard from the revolving wheel. The rate of motion being so high that the human ear cannot register the vibrations. 


## Heat 

Then comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. Then after quite a time the eye catches a glimpse of the object becoming a dull dark reddish color. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter.

Then as the speed is increased, the red melts into an orange. Then the orange melts into a yellow. 

Then follow, successively, the shades of green, blue, indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of sped increases. Then the violet shades away, and all color disappears, the human eye not being able to register them. 

But there are invisible rays emanating from the revolving object, the rays that are used in photographing, and other subtle rays of light. Then begin to manifest the peculiar rays known as the "X Rays," etc., as the constitution of the object changes. Electricity and Magnetism are emitted when the appropriate rate of vibration is attained.

When the object reaches a certain rate of vibration its molecules disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the original elements or atoms. Then the atoms, following the Principle of Vibration, are separated into the countless corpuscles of which they are composed. And finally, even the corpuscles disappear and the object may be said to Be composed of The Ethereal Substance. 


Science does not dare to follow the illustration further. 

But the Hermetists teach that if the vibrations be continually increased, the object would go up the successive states into the various mental stages, and then on Spiritward, until it would finally re-enter THE ALL, which is Absolute Spirit. 

The "object" would cease to be an "object" long before the stage of Ethereal Substance was reached. <!-- But otherwise the illustration is correct inasmuch as it shows the effect of constantly increased rates and modes of vibration.  -->

At the stages at which the "object" throws off vibrations of light, heat, etc., it is not actually "resolved" into those forms of energy (which are much higher in the scale), but simply that it reaches a degree of vibration in which those forms of energy are liberated, in a degree, from the confining influences of its molecules, atoms and corpuscles, as the case may be.

These forms of energy are higher than matter. But they are imprisoned and confined in the material combinations, by reason of the energies manifesting through, and using material forms. 

but thus becoming entangled and confined in their creations of material forms, which, to an extent, is true of all creations, the creating force becoming involved in its creation.

All manifestation of thought, emotion, reason, will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by vibrations. A portion of these vibtrations are thrown off and affect the minds of other persons by "induction." 

This is the principle produces "telepathy"; mental influence, and other forms of the action and power of mind over mind, with which the general public is rapidly becoming acquainted, owing to the wide dissemination of occult knowledge by the various schools, cults and teachers along these lines at this time.

Every thought, emotion or mental state has its corresponding rate and mode of vibration. 

And by an effort of the will of the person, or of other persons, these mental states may be reproduced, just as a musical tone may be reproduced by causing an instrument to vibrate at a certain rate—just as color may be reproduced in the same may.

The Principle of Vibration, as applied to Mental Phenomena, can be used to polarize one's mind to gain a perfect control over his mental states, moods, etc. 

In the same way, he can affect the minds of others, producing the desired mental states in them.

In short, he may be able to produce on the Mental Plane that which science produces on the Physical Plane—namely, "Vibrations at Will." This power of course may be acquired only by the proper instruction, exercises, practice, etc., the science being that of Mental Transmutation, one of the branches of the Hermetic Art.

The Principle of Vibration underlies the wonderful phenomena of the power manifested by the Masters and Adepts. They <!-- , who are able to apparently set aside the Laws of Nature, but who, in reality, are simply --> use:
- one law against another
- one principle against others
- accomplish their results by changing the vibrations of material objects, or forms of energy, and thus perform what are commonly called "miracles."

<!-- As one of the old Hermetic writers has truly said: "He who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of Power."
