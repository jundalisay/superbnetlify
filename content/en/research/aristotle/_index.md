description: "Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who wrote about the different Greek philosophies and advanced his own substance-based beliefs. He corrupted Socratic Dialectics by removing its spritual foundation, replacing it with a mental foundation, as a thesis. Hegel (or someone who interpreted Hegel) then built on it with antithesis and synthesis."
