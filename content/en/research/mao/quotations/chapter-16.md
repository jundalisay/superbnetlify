Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to
develop morally, intellectually and physically and become a worker with both
socialist consciousness and culture.

As for education for cadres whether at work or in schools for cadres, a policy should be established of focusing such education on the study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and the method of studying Marxism-
Leninism statically and in isolation should be discarded.

A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group of several people, or a dozen or more, which is formed in accordance with the actual circumstances (and not thrown together artificially) and is composed of the most active, upright and alert of the

All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards certain victory in the war and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all enemies.

Equal importance should be attached to the military and political aspects ofthe one-year consolidation and training programme which has just begun, and the two aspects should be integrated. At the start, stress should be placed on the political aspect, on improving relations between officers and men, enhancing internal unity and arousing a high level of enthusiasm among the
masses of cadres and fighters. Only thus will the military consolidation and training proceed smoothly and attain better results.

Our slogan in training troops is, "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach
officers and soldiers teach each other". The fighters have a lot of practical
combat experience. The officers should learn from the fighters, and when
they have made other people's experience their own, they will become more
capable.

As for the training courses, the main objective should still be to raise the level
of technique in marksmanship, bayoneting grenade-throwing and the like and
the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics, while special
emphasis should be laid on night operations.
