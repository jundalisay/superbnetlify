Monsters of all kinds shall be destroyed.

The Communist Party of China has appraised the global situation on the basis of the science of Marxism-Leninism. We recognized that all attacks by the reactionaries at home and abroad had to be defeated and could be defeated. 

When dark clouds appeared in the sky, we pointed out that they were only temporary, that the darkness would soon pass and the sun break through.

Historically, all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are apt to be deluded for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but inner weakness failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching victory.

If they [the Kuomintang] fight, we will wipe them out completely. This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe them out, they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some, some satisfaction; wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, complete satisfaction. China 's problems are complicated, and our brains must also be a little complicated. If they start fighting, we fight back, fight to win peace.

If anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for battle, we will
certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out resolutely, thoroughly, wholly
and completely (we do not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we must
win). We must never be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries.

As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight even for a single
day. But if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the finish.

We are for peace. But so long as U.S. imperialism refuses to give up its arrogant and unreasonable demands and its scheme to extend aggression, the only course for the Chinese people is to remain determined to go on fighting side by side with the Korean people. Not that we are warlike. 

We are willing to stop the war at once and leave the remaining questions for later settlement.

But U.S. imperialism is not willing to do so. All right then, let the fighting go on. However many years U.S. imperialism wants to fight, we are ready to fight right up to the moment when it is willing to stop, right up to the moment of complete victory for the Chinese and Korean peoples.

We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking. All views that overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are wrong.

The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "sensibleness" of imperialism and its lackeys. They will only triumph by strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle.

1. No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared. If it comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should also be prepared.
2. In the present global situation, it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted in scale and localized. 

Point one is what we should prepare
for, point two is what has existed for a long time. 

In short, we must be prepared. Being prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations.
