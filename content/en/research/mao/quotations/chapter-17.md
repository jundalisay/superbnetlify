We should be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, and serve the Chinese people heart and soul…

"China's Two Possible Destinies" (April 23, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III p. 253.

Our point of departure is to serve the people whole-heartedly and never for a moment divorce ourselves from the masses, to proceed in all cases from the interests of the people and not from one's self-interest or from the interests of
a small group, and to identify our responsibility to the people with our
responsibility to the leading organs of the Party.

"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 315.*
The organs of state must practise democratic centralism, they must rely on
the masses and their personnel must serve the people.
On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957),
1st pocket ed., p. 8.*

Comrade Bethune's spirit, his utter devotion to others without any thought of
self, was shown in his boundless sense of responsibility in his work and his
boundless warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people. Every
Communist must learn from him.
…

We must all learn the spirit of absolute selflessness from him. With this
spirit everyone can be very useful to the people. A man's ability may be great
or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already noble-minded and pure, a man
of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the
people.
"In Memory of Norman Bethune" (December 21, 1939), Selected Works, Vol. II, pp.
337-38.*

Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies led by
our Party are battalions of the revolution. These battalions of ours are wholly
dedicated to the liberation of the people and work entirely in the people's
interests."Serve the People" (September 8, 1944), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 227.
All our cadres, whatever their rank, are servants of the people, and whatever
we do is to serve the people. How then can we be reluctant to discard any of
our bad traits?
"The Tasks for 1945" (December 15, 1944).
Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people. Every word, every act
and every policy must conform to the people's interests, and if mistakes
occur, they must be corrected - that is what being responsible to the people
means.
"The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against
Japan" (August 13, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 16.
Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common
occurrence. But we have the interests of the people and the sufferings of the
great majority at heart, and when we die for the people it is a worthy death.
Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.
"Serve the People" (September 8, 1944), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 228.
All men must die, but death can vary in its significance. The ancient Chinese
writer Szuma Chien said, "Though death befalls all men alike, it may be
weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." To die for the people is
weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the
exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather.
Ibid., p. 227.*
