Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our era. He has
inherited, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism with genius, creatively
and comprehensively and has brought it to a higher and completely new
stage.
Mao Tse-tung's thought is Marxism-Leninism of the era in which
imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is advancing to world-
wide victory. It is a powerful ideological weapon for opposing imperialism
and for opposing revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Tse-tung's thought is the
guiding principle for all the work of the Party, the army and the country.
Therefore, the most fundamental task in our Party's political and
ideological work is at all times to hold high the great red banner of Mao Tse-
tung's thought, to arm the minds of the people throughout the country with it
and to persist in using it to command every field of activity. The broad
masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers and the broad ranks of the
revolutionary cadres and the intellectuals should really master Mao Tse-
tung's thought; they should all study Chairman Mao's writings, follow his
teachings, act according to his instructions and be his good fighters.
In studying the works of Chairman Mao, one should have specific
problems in mind, study and apply his works in a creative way, combine
study with application, first study what must be urgently applied so as to get
quick results, and strive hard to apply what one is studying. In order really to
master Mao Tse-tung's thought, it is essential to study many of Chairman
Mao's basic concepts over and over again, and it is best to memorize
important statements and study and apply them repeatedly. The newspapers
should regularly carry quotations from Chairman Mao relevant to current
issues for readers to study and apply.
The experience of the broad masses in their creative study and application
of Chairman Mao's works in the last few years has proved that to study
selected quotations from Chairman Mao with specific problems in mind is a
good way to learn Mao Tse-tung's thought, a method conducive to quick
results.
We have compiled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in order tohelp the broad masses learn Mao Tse-tung's thought more effectively. In
organizing their study, units should select passages that are relevant to the
situation, their tasks, the current thinking of their personnel, and the state of
their work.
In our great motherland, a new era is emerging in which the workers,
peasants and soldiers are grasping Marxism-Leninism, Mao Tse-tung's
thought. Once Mao Tse-tung's thought is grasped by the broad masses, it
becomes an inexhaustible source of strength and a spiritual atom bomb of
infinite power. The large-scale publication of Quotations from Chairman
Mao Tse-tung is a vital measure for enabling the broad masses to grasp Mao
Tse-tung's thought and for promoting the revolutionization of our people's
thinking. It is our hope that all comrades will learn earnestly and diligently,
bring about a new nation-wide high tide in the creative study and application
of Chairman Mao's works and, under the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's
thought, strive to build our country into a great socialist state with modern
agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture and modern
national defence!

The force at the core leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party, which is based on Marxism-Leninism.

<!-- Opening address at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the
People's Republic of China (September 15, 1954). -->

A revolution requires a revolutionary party. Without the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the masses to defeat imperialism and its running dogs.

Without the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communists as the mainstay of the Chinese people, China can never achieve independence and liberation, or industrialization and the modernization of her agriculture.

The Chinese Communist Party is the core of leadership of the whole Chinese people. Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious. Talk at the general reception for the delegates to the Third National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China (May 25, 1957).

 
Our 3 main weapons which defeated the enemy are: 
- A well-disciplined Party armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, using the method of self-criticism and linked with the masses of the people
- an army under the Party
- a united front of all revolutionary classes and groups under the Party

We must have faith in the masses and we must have faith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing.

Armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and ideology, the Communist Party of China has brought a new style of work to the Chinese people, a style of work which essentially entails integrating theory with practice, forging close links with the masses and practising self-criticism.

No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses revolutionary theory and a knowledge of history and has a profound grasp of the practical movement.

As we used to say, the rectification movement is "a widespread movement of Marxist education". Rectification means the whole Party studying Marxism through criticism and self-criticism. We can certainly learn more about Marxism in the course of the rectification movement.

It is an arduous task to ensure a better life for the several hundred million people of China and to build our economically and culturally backward country into a prosperous and powerful one with a high level of culture. 

It is precisely in order to be able to shoulder this task more competently and work better together with all non-Party people who are actuated by high ideals and determined to institute reforms that we must conduct rectification movements both now and in the future, and constantly rid ourselves of whatever is wrong.

Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party and manifests itself in the process and the end-result of that party's actions. A revolutionary party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action. 

If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing so blindly. What wecall experience is the process and the end-result of carrying out a policy.

Only through the practice of the people, that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and determine to what extent it is correct or wrong. But people's practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the revolutionary masses, cannot but be bound up with one policy or another. 

Therefore, before any action is taken, we must explain the policy, which we have formulated in the light of the given circumstances, to Party members and to the masses. Otherwise, Party
members and the masses will depart from the guidance of our policy, act
blindly and carry out a wrong policy.

Our Party has laid down the general line and policy of the Chinese revolution as well as various specific lines for work and specific policies. However, while many comrades remember our Party's specific lines for work and specific policies, they often forget its general line and general policy. 

If we actually forget the Party's general line and general policy, then we shall be blind, half-baked, muddle-headed revolutionaries, and when we carry out a specific line for work and a specific policy, we shall lose our bearings and vacillate now to the left and now to the right, and the work will suffer.

Policy and tactics are the life of the Party; leading comrades at all levels must
give them full attention and must never on any account be negligent.
