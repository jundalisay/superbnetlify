## Article 39

The SC shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. It shall recommen or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.


## Article 40

In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation, the Security Council may, before making the
recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39, call upon the parties
concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable. 

Such provisional measures shall be without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the parties concerned. 

The Security Council shall duly take account of failure to comply with such provisional measures.


## Article 41

The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to
apply such measures.

These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations
and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio,
and other means of communication, and the sev-
erance of diplomatic relations.


## Article 42

Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inade-
quate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include
demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of UN Members.


## Article 43

1. All UN Members, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance, and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.
2. Such agreement or agreements shall govern the numbers and types of forces, their degree of
readiness and general location, and the nature of the facilities and assistance to be provided.
3. The agreement or agreements shall be negotiated as soon as possible on the initiative of the
Security Council. They shall be concluded between the Security Council and Members or be-
tween the Security Council and groups of Members and shall be subject to ratification by the signatory states in accordance with their respective constitutional processes.


## Article 44

When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member notrepresented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilhnent of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.


## Article 45

In order to enable the United Nations to take urgent military measures, Members shall hold
immediately available national air-force contingents for combined international enforcement ac-
tion. 

The strength and degree of readiness of these contingents and plans for their combined action shall be determined, within the limits laid down in the special agreement or agreements referred to
in Article 43, by the Security Council with the assistance of the Military Staff Committee.



## Article 46

Plans for the application of armed force shall be made by the Security Council with the assist-
ance of the Military Staff Committee.

### Article 47

1. There shall be established a Military Staff Committee to advise and assist the Security Council on all questions relating to the Security Council's military requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security, the employment and command of forces placed at its disposal, the regulation of armaments, and possible disarmament.
2. The Military Staff Committee shall consist of the Chiefs of Staff of the permanent members of the Security Council or their representatives.

Any Member of the United Nations not permanently represented on the Committee shall be invited by the Committee to be associated with it when the efficient discharge of the Committee's responsibilities requires the participation of that Member in its work.

3. The Military Staff Committee shall be responsible under the Security Council for the strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council. Questions relating to the command of such forces shall be worked out subsequently.

4. The Military Staff Committee, with the
authorization of the Security Council and after
consultation with appropriate regional agencies,
may establish regional subcommittees.

### Article 48

1. The action required to carry out the decisions of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security shall be taken by all the Members of the United Nations
or by some of them, as the Security Council may determine.
2. Such decisions shall be carried out by the Members of the United Nations directly and
through their action in the appropriate international agencies of which they are members.


### Article 49

The Members of the United Nations shall join in affording mutual assistance in carrying out the
measures decided upon by the Security Council.

### Article 50

If preventive or enforcement measures against any state are taken by the Security Council, any
other state, whether a Member of the United Nations or not, which finds itself confronted with
special economic problems arising from the carrying out of those measures shall have the right to
consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems.

### Article 51

Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-
defense if an armed attack occurs against a UN Member, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. 

Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-
defense shall be immediately reported to the Se-
curity Council and shall not in any way affect the
authority and responsibility of the Security Coun-
cil under the present Charter to take at any time
such action as it deems necessary in order to main-
tain or restore international peace and security.
