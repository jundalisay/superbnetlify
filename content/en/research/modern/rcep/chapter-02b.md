Code, the value of non-originating materials that have been
used in the production of the good and did not undergo the
applicable change in tariff classification does not exceed
10 per cent of the FOB value of that good. The value of
those non-originating materials shall be determined
pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 3.5 (Calculation of
Regional Value Content); or
(b) for a good classified in Chapters 50 through 63 of the HS
Code, the weight of all non-originating materials used in its
production that did not undergo the required change in tariff
classification does not exceed 10 per cent of the total
weight of the good.

specific
manufacturing
or
processing
operation
requirement provided in Annex 3A (Product-Specific
Rules).
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the
value of the packaging materials and containers in which the good
is packaged for retail sale shall be taken into account as
originating materials or non-originating materials of the good, as
the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the
good.

whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of
the good have undergone the applicable change in tariff
classification or a specific manufacturing or processing operation
set out in Annex 3A (Product-Specific Rules), provided that:
(a) the accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or
other information materials presented with the good are not
invoiced separately from the good; and
(b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts,
tools, and instructional or other information materials
presented with the good are customary for the good.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if a good is subject to a regional
value content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare

presented with the good shall be taken into account as originating
materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in
calculating the regional value content of the good, provided that:
(a)
the accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or
other information materials presented with the good are not
invoiced separately from the good; and
3-9(b)
the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts,
tools, and instructional or other information materials
presented with the good are customary for the good.
Article 3.10: Indirect Materials
1. An indirect material shall be treated as an originating material
without regard to where it is produced and its value shall be the
cost registered in accordance with the Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the records of the producer of the good.
2. For the purposes of this Article, “indirect material” means a good
used in the production, testing, or inspection of another good but
not physically incorporated into that other good, or a good used in

demonstrated to be a part of that production.
Article 3.11: Fungible Goods or Materials
The determination of whether fungible goods or materials are originating
shall be made either by physical segregation of each of the fungible
3-10goods or materials or, where commingled, by the use of an inventory
management method which is recognised in the Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles of the exporting Party, and should be used
throughout the fiscal year.
Article 3.12: Materials Used in Production
If a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it
satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the material shall be treated
as originating when determining the originating status of the
subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was
produced by the producer of the good.
Article 3.13: Unit of Qualification
1. The unit of qualification for the application of this Chapter shall be
the particular good which is considered as the basic unit when
determining classification under the Harmonized System.
2. When a consignment consists of a number of identical goods
classified under a single tariff line, each good shall be individually
taken into account in determining whether it qualifies as an
originating good.
Article 3.14: Treatment for Certain Goods
The Parties and signatory States shall enter into discussions on the
treatment for certain goods under this Chapter upon the request of a
Party and conclude such discussions within three years from the start of
the discussions. The treatment for certain goods under this Chapter
shall be subject to agreement of all the Parties and signatory States by
consensus.

this Article), or non-Parties, provided that the good:
(i) has not undergone any further processing in the
intermediate Parties or the non-Parties, except for
logistics activities such as unloading, reloading,
storing, or any other operations necessary to
preserve it in good condition or to transport it to the
importing Party; and
(ii) remains under the control of the customs authorities
in the intermediate Parties or the non-Parties.
2. Compliance with subparagraph 1(b) shall be evidenced by
presenting the customs authorities of the importing Party either
with customs documents of the intermediate Parties or the non-
Parties, or with any other appropriate documentation on request
of the customs authorities of the importing Party.
3. Appropriate documentation referred to in paragraph 2 may
include commercial shipping or freight documents such as airway
bills, bills of lading, multimodal or combined transport documents,
a copy of the original commercial invoice in respect of the good,
financial records, a non-manipulation certificate, or other relevant
