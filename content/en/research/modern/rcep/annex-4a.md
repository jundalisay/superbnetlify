SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES
Article 5.1: Definitions
For the purposes of this Chapter:
(a) the definitions provided in Annex A of the SPS Agreement
shall apply;
(b) relevant definitions developed by Codex Alimentarius
Commission, the World Organisation for Animal Health,
and the International Plant Protection Convention shall be
taken into account;
(c) competent authorities means those authorities within
each Party recognised by the national government as
responsible for developing and administering the sanitary
and phytosanitary measures within that Party; and
(d) emergency measure means a sanitary or phytosanitary
measure that is applied by an importing Party to a relevant
exporting Party to address an urgent problem of human,
animal or plant life or health protection that arises or
threatens to arise in the Party applying the measure.
Article 5.2: Objectives
The objectives of this Chapter are to:
(a) protect human, animal or plant life or health in the Parties
through the development, adoption, and application of
sanitary and phytosanitary measures, while facilitating
trade by minimising the negative effects on trade among
the Parties;
(b) enhance the practical implementation of the SPS
Agreement;
(c) enhance the transparency and understanding of the
development and application of sanitary and phytosanitary
measures of the Parties;
5-1(d) strengthen cooperation, communication, and consultation
among the Parties in the field of sanitary and phytosanitary
measures; and
(e) encourage the Parties’ participation in the development
and adoption of international standards, guidelines, and
recommendations.
Article 5.3: Scope
This Chapter shall apply to all sanitary and phytosanitary measures of
the Parties, which may, directly or indirectly, affect trade among the
Parties.
Article 5.4: General Provision
Each Party affirms its rights and obligations with respect to each other
Party under the SPS Agreement.
Article 5.5: Equivalence
1. The Parties shall strengthen cooperation on equivalence in
accordance with the SPS Agreement while taking into account the
relevant decisions of the WTO Committee on Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter referred to as “WTO SPS
Committee” in this Chapter) and international standards,
guidelines, and recommendations.
2. An importing Party shall recognise the equivalence of a sanitary
or phytosanitary measure if an exporting Party objectively
demonstrates to the importing Party that the exporting Party’s
measure achieves the same level of protection as the importing
Party’s measure, or that the exporting Party’s measure has the
same effect in achieving the objective as the importing Party’s
measure.
3. In determining the equivalence of a sanitary or phytosanitary
measure, the importing Party shall take into account available
knowledge, information, and experience, as well as the regulatory
competence, of the exporting Party.
4. A Party shall, upon request, enter into consultation with the aim
of achieving bilateral recognition arrangements on the
5-2equivalence of specified sanitary or phytosanitary measures. The
recognition of equivalence under such bilateral recognition
arrangements may be with respect to a single measure, a group
of measures, or on a systems-wide basis. For this purpose,
reasonable access shall be given by the exporting Party, upon
request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing, and other
relevant procedures.
5.
As part of the consultation for equivalence recognition, on request
of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall explain and
provide:
(a) the rationale and objective of its measures; and
(b) the specific risks its measures are intended to address.
6. The exporting Party shall provide necessary information in order
for the importing Party to commence an equivalence assessment.
Once the assessment commences, the importing Party shall,
upon request, and without undue delay, explain the process and
plan for making an equivalence determination.
7. The consideration by a Party of a request from another Party for
recognition of the equivalence of its measures with regard to a
specific product, or group of products, shall not be in itself a
reason to disrupt or suspend ongoing imports from the Party of
the product or products in question.
8. When an importing Party recognises the equivalence of an
exporting Party’s specific sanitary or phytosanitary measure,
group of measures, or measures on a systems-wide basis, the
importing Party shall communicate the decision in writing to the
exporting Party and implement the measure within a reasonable
period of time. The rationale shall be provided in writing by the
importing Party in the event that the decision is negative.
9. The Parties involved in a positive determination of equivalence
are encouraged, where mutually agreed, to share information and
experiences at the Committee on Goods.
Article 5.6: Adaptation to Regional Conditions, including Pest- or
Disease-Free Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence
1.
The Parties recognise the concepts of regional conditions,
including pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or
5-3disease prevalence. The Parties shall take into account the
relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and international
standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
2. The Parties may cooperate on the recognition of regional
conditions with the objective of acquiring confidence in the
procedures followed by each Party for such recognition.
3. On request of an exporting Party, an importing Party shall, without
undue delay, explain its process and plan for making a
determination of regional conditions.
4. When an importing Party has received a request for a
determination of regional conditions from an exporting Party and
has determined that the information provided by the exporting
Party is sufficient, it shall initiate the assessment within a
reasonable period of time.
5. For such an assessment, reasonable access shall be given by the
exporting Party, upon request, to the importing Party for
inspection, testing, and other relevant procedures.
6. On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform
the exporting Party of the status of the assessment.
7. When an importing Party recognises specific regional conditions
of an exporting Party, the importing Party shall communicate that
decision to the exporting Party in writing and implement the
measures within a reasonable period of time.
8. If the evaluation of the evidence provided by the exporting Party
does not result in a decision by the importing Party to recognise
the regional conditions, the importing Party shall provide the
exporting Party with the rationale for its decision in writing within
a reasonable period of time.
9. The Parties involved in a determination recognising regional
conditions are encouraged, where mutually agreed, to report the
outcome to the Committee on Goods.
Article 5.7: Risk Analysis
1.
The Parties shall strengthen their cooperation on risk analysis in
accordance with the SPS Agreement while taking into account the
5-4relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and international
standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
2.
When conducting a risk analysis, an importing Party shall:
(a) ensure that the risk analysis is documented and that it
provides the relevant exporting Party or Parties with an
opportunity to comment, in a manner to be determined by
the importing Party;
(b) consider risk management options that are not more trade
restrictive than required 1 to achieve its appropriate level of
sanitary or phytosanitary protection; and
(c) select a risk management option that is not more trade
restrictive than required to achieve its appropriate level of
sanitary or phytosanitary protection, taking into account
technical and economic feasibility.
3. On request of an exporting Party, an importing Party shall inform
the exporting Party of the progress of a specific risk analysis
request, and of any delay that may occur during the process.
4. Without prejudice to emergency measures, no Party shall stop the
importation of a good of another Party solely for the reason that
the importing Party is undertaking a review of a sanitary or
phytosanitary measure, if the importing Party permitted
importation of the good of the other Party at the time of the
initiation of the review.
Article 5.8: Audit 2
1.
In undertaking an audit, each Party shall take into account the
relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and international
standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
1
For the purpose of subparagraphs (b) and (c), a risk management option is not more
trade restrictive than required unless there is another option reasonably available,
taking into account technical and economic feasibility, that achieves the appropriate
level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection and is significantly less restrictive to trade.
2
For greater certainty, without affecting the implementation of this Article, nothing in
this Article prevents a Party from adopting or maintaining halal requirements for food
and food products in accordance with Islamic law.
5-52. An audit shall be systems-based and conducted to assess the
effectiveness of the regulatory controls of the competent
authorities of the exporting Party to provide the required
assurances and meet the sanitary and phytosanitary measures of
the importing Party. 3
3. Prior to the commencement of an audit, the importing Party and
exporting Party involved shall exchange information on the
objectives and scope of the audit and other matters related
specifically to the commencement of an audit.
4. The importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with an
opportunity to comment on the finding of an audit and take any
such comments into account before making its conclusions and
taking any action. The importing Party shall provide a report or its
summary, setting out its conclusions in writing to the exporting
Party within a reasonable period of time. The importing Party shall
inform the exporting Party if a request is required to provide such
report or summary.
Article 5.9: Certification
1. In applying certification requirements, each Party shall take into
account the relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and
international standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
2. An exporting Party shall ensure that the documents, including
certificates, that are required by an importing Party and provided
by the competent authorities of the exporting Party, to demonstrate
the fulfilment of the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the
importing Party, are in the English language, unless the importing
Party and exporting Party agree otherwise. 4 When the importing
Party requires such documents, the importing Party shall
endeavour to provide the requirements for such documents in the
English language. Upon request, the importing Party shall provide
a summary or explanation of such requirements.
3
For greater certainty, nothing in this paragraph prevents an importing Party from
performing an inspection of a facility for the purposes of determining if the facility
conforms with the importing Party’s sanitary or phytosanitary requirements or conforms
with sanitary or phytosanitary requirements that the importing Party has determined to
be equivalent to its sanitary or phytosanitary requirements.
4
For greater certainty, this provision does not prevent the Parties from including
information for certification in other languages in addition to the English language.
5-63. The Parties recognise that an importing Party may, as appropriate,
allow assurances with respect to sanitary or phytosanitary
requirements to be provided through means other than certificates,
and that different systems may be capable of meeting the same
sanitary and phytosanitary objectives.
4. Where certification is required for trade in a good, the importing
Party shall ensure that such certification requirements are applied
only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life
or health.
5. Without prejudice to each Party’s right to import controls, the
importing Party shall accept certificates issued by the competent
authorities of the exporting Party that are in compliance with the
regulatory requirements of the importing Party.
Article 5.10: Import Checks
1. In applying import checks, each Party shall take into account the
relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and international
standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
2. Import checks, conducted in accordance with the importing Party’s
laws, regulations, and sanitary and phytosanitary requirements,
shall be based on the sanitary and phytosanitary risk associated
with importations. In the event that import checks reveal a non-
compliance, the final decision or action taken by the importing
Party shall be appropriate to the sanitary and phytosanitary risk
associated with the importation of the non-compliant product.
3. If an importing Party prohibits or restricts the importation of a good
of an exporting Party on the basis of non-compliance of that good
found during an import check, the importing Party shall notify the
importer or its representatives and, if the importing Party considers
necessary, the exporting Party of such non-compliance.
4. When significant or recurring sanitary or phytosanitary non-
compliance associated with exported consignments is identified by
the importing Party, the Parties concerned shall, on request of
either Party, discuss the non-compliance to ensure that
appropriate remedial actions are taken to reduce such non-
compliance.
5-7Article 5.11: Emergency Measures
1. If a Party adopts an emergency measure that is necessary for the
protection of human, animal or plant life or health and that may
have an effect on trade, that Party shall immediately notify the
relevant exporting Parties in writing through the contact point or
contact points designated under Article 5.15 (Contact Points and
Competent Authorities) or already established communication
channels of the Parties.
2. The relevant exporting Parties may request discussions with the
Party adopting an emergency measure referred to in paragraph
1. Such discussions shall be held as soon as practicable. Each
Party participating in the discussions shall endeavour to provide
relevant information, and shall take due account of any
information provided through the discussions.
3. If a Party adopts an emergency measure, it shall review that
measure within a reasonable period of time or on request of the
exporting Party. The importing Party may, if necessary, request
relevant information and the exporting Party shall endeavour to
provide the relevant information to assist the importing Party in its
review of the adopted emergency measure. The importing Party
shall provide the result of the review to the exporting Party upon
request. If the emergency measure is maintained after the review,
the importing Party should review the measure periodically based
on the most recent available information, and upon request, shall
explain the reason for the continuation of the emergency
measure.
Article 5.12: Transparency
1. The Parties recognise the importance of transparency as set out
in Annex B of the SPS Agreement.
2. The Parties recognise the importance of the exchange of
information on the development, adoption, and application of
sanitary and phytosanitary measures that may have significant
effects on trade among the Parties.
3. In implementing this Article, the Parties shall take into account the
relevant decisions of the WTO SPS Committee and international
standards, guidelines, and recommendations.
5-84. Each Party shall notify proposed measures or changes to sanitary
or phytosanitary measures that may have a significant effect on
the trade of other Parties through the online WTO Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures Notification Submission System, the
contact points designated under Article 5.15 (Contact Points and
Competent Authorities), or already established communication
channels of the Parties.
5. Unless urgent problems of health protection arise or threaten to
arise, or the measure is of a trade facilitating nature, a Party shall
normally allow a period of at least 60 days for other Parties to
provide written comments after it makes a notification pursuant to
paragraph 4. A Party shall consider reasonable requests from
another Party to extend the comment period.
6. As part of the comment period referred to in paragraph 5, on
request of another Party and if appropriate and feasible, the
notifying Party shall consider any scientific or trade concerns and
the availability of alternatives that the other Party may raise
regarding the proposed measure.
7. Upon request, a Party shall, within 30 days of the request, provide
the requesting Party with the documents or a summary of the
documents describing the requirements of draft sanitary or
phytosanitary measures notified to the WTO pursuant to
paragraph 4, in the English language.
8. Following the notification of sanitary or phytosanitary measures to
the WTO, upon request, a Party shall provide the requesting Party
with the documents or a summary of the documents describing the
requirements of the adopted sanitary or phytosanitary measures,
within a reasonable period of time as agreed by the relevant
Parties, in the English language.
9. A Party, on reasonable request of another Party, shall provide
relevant information and clarification regarding any sanitary or
phytosanitary measure to the requesting Party, within a
reasonable period of time, including:
(a) the sanitary or phytosanitary requirements that apply to the
import of specific products;
(b) the status of the requesting Party’s application; and
(c) procedures for authorising the import of specific products.
5-910. An exporting Party shall provide timely and appropriate
information to relevant Parties through the contact points
designated under Article 5.15 (Contact Points and Competent
Authorities) or already established communication channels of
the Parties, where there is a significant change in animal or plant
health status or food safety issues in that exporting Party that may
affect trade.
11. An importing Party shall provide timely and appropriate
information to relevant Parties through the contact points
designated under Article 5.15 (Contact Points and Competent
Authorities) or already established communication channels of
the Parties, where there is:
12.
(a) significant or recurring sanitary or phytosanitary non-
compliance associated with exported consignments
identified by the importing Party; or
(b) a sanitary or phytosanitary measure adopted provisionally
against or affecting the export of another Party considered
necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health
within the importing Party.
An exporting Party shall, to the extent possible and as promptly
as possible, provide information to the importing Party if the
exporting Party identifies that an export consignment that may be
associated with a significant sanitary or phytosanitary risk has
been exported.
Article 5.13: Cooperation and Capacity Building
1. The Parties shall explore opportunities for further cooperation
among the Parties, including capacity building, technical
assistance, collaboration, and information exchange, on sanitary
and phytosanitary matters of mutual interest, consistent with this
Chapter, subject to the availability of appropriate resources.
2. Any two or more Parties may cooperate on any matter, including
sector specific proposals, of mutual interest under this Chapter.
3. In undertaking cooperation activities, the Parties shall endeavour
to coordinate with bilateral, regional, or multilateral work
programmes, with the objective of avoiding unnecessary
duplication and maximising the use of resources.
5-104.
The Parties are encouraged to share information and the
experiences of their cooperation activities with other Parties at the
Committee on Goods.
Article 5.14: Technical Consultation
1. Where a Party considers that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure
is affecting its trade with another Party, it may, through the contact
points designated under Article 5.15 (Contact Points and
Competent Authorities) or already established communication
channels, request a detailed explanation of the sanitary or
phytosanitary measure. The other Party shall respond promptly
to any request for such explanation.
2. A Party may request to hold technical consultations with another
Party in an attempt to resolve any concerns on specific issues
arising from the application of the sanitary or phytosanitary
measure. The requested Party shall respond promptly to any
reasonable request for such consultation. The consulting Parties
shall make every effort to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.
3. Where a Party requests technical consultations, these shall take
place within 30 days of the receipt of the request, unless
otherwise agreed. Such consultation should aim to resolve the
matter within 180 days of the date of the request, or a time frame
agreed by the consulting Parties.
4. The technical consultations may be conducted via
teleconference, videoconference, or through any other means
agreed by the consulting Parties.
Article 5.15: Contact Points and Competent Authorities
1.
Each Party shall, within 30 days of the date of entry into force of
this Agreement for that Party:
(a) designate one or more contact points to facilitate
communication on matters covered under this Chapter;
(b) notify the other Parties of the contact details of that contact
point or those contact points; and
(c) when more than one contact point is designated, specify a
contact point that serves as the focal point to respond to
5-11enquiries from another Party on the appropriate contact
point with which to communicate.
2. Each Party shall provide the other Parties, through the contact

Article
6.5:
International
Recommendations
Standards,
Guides,
and
1. The Parties recognise the important role that international
standards, guides, and recommendations can play in the
harmonisation of technical regulations, conformity assessment
procedures, and national standards, and in reducing unnecessary
barriers to trade.
2. In determining whether an international standard, guide, or
recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5 and
Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement exists, each Party takes into
account the principles set out in the Decision of the Committee on
Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides
and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3
of the Agreement (G/TBT/9, 13 November 2000, Annex 4), and
subsequent relevant decisions and recommendations in this
regard, adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to
Trade (hereinafter referred to as “WTO TBT Committee” in this
Chapter).
3. The Parties shall, where appropriate, strengthen coordination and
communication with each other in the context of discussions on
international standards and related issues in other international
fora, such as the WTO TBT Committee.
Article 6.6: Standards
1. With respect to the preparation, adoption, and application of
standards, each Party shall ensure that its standardising body or
bodies that prepare, adopt, and apply national standards accept
and comply with Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.
2. Where modifications to the contents or structure of the relevant
international standards were necessary in developing a Party’s
national standards, that Party shall, on request of another Party,
encourage its standardising body or bodies to provide what the
differences in the contents and structure are, and the reason for
those differences. Any fees charged for this service shall, apart
from the real cost of delivery, be the same for foreign and
domestic persons.
6-33. Further to paragraph 2, each Party shall ensure that its
standardising body or bodies ensure that the modifications of the
contents and structure of international standards are not
prepared, adopted, or applied with a view to, or with the effect of,
creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
4. Each Party shall encourage cooperation between the relevant
standardising body or bodies in its territory and the standardising
body or bodies of other Parties, in areas such as:
(a) exchange of information on standards;
(b) exchange of information relating to standard setting
procedures; and
(c) international standardising activities in areas of mutual
interest.
Article 6.7: Technical Regulations
1. Each Party shall use relevant international standards or the
relevant parts of them, to the extent provided in paragraph 4 of
Article 2 of the TBT Agreement, as a basis for its technical
regulations. Where a Party does not use such international
standards, or their relevant parts, as a basis for its technical
regulations, it shall, on request of another Party, explain the
reasons therefor.
2. In implementing paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the TBT Agreement,
each Party shall consider available alternatives in order to ensure
that the proposed technical regulations to be adopted are not
more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate
objective.
3. Each Party shall give positive consideration to accepting as
equivalent, technical regulations of another Party, even if those
regulations differ from its own, provided it is satisfied that those
regulations adequately fulfil the objectives of its own regulations.
4. Where a Party does not accept a technical regulation of another
Party as equivalent to its own, it shall, on request of the other
Party, explain the reasons for its decision.
6-45. In implementing paragraph 8 of Article 2 of the TBT Agreement,
when a Party does not specify technical regulations based on
product requirements in terms of performance rather than design
or descriptive characteristics, the Party shall, on request of
another Party, provide its reason therefor.
6. Except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental
protection, or national security arise or threaten to arise, Parties
shall allow a reasonable interval between the publication of
technical regulations and their entry into force in order to provide
sufficient time for producers in exporting Parties to adapt their
products or methods of production to the requirements of
importing Parties.
For the purposes of this paragraph,
“reasonable interval” shall be understood to mean normally a
period of not less than six months, except when this would be
ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued by the
technical regulation.
7. On request of a Party that has an interest in developing a
technical regulation similar to a technical regulation of another
Party, the requested Party shall provide, to the extent practicable,
relevant information, including studies or documents, except for
confidential information, on which it has relied in its development.
8. Each Party shall uniformly and consistently apply its technical
regulations that are prepared and adopted by its central
government bodies to its whole territory. For greater certainty,
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent local
government bodies from preparing, adopting, and applying
additional technical regulations in a manner consistent with the
provisions of the TBT Agreement.
Article 6.8: Conformity Assessment Procedures
1.
Further to paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement, each
Party shall ensure that central government bodies use relevant
international standards or their relevant parts as a basis for their
conformity assessment procedures, except where, as duly
explained upon request, such international standards or relevant
parts are inappropriate for the Party concerned, for, inter alia,
such reasons as: national security requirements; the prevention
of deceptive practices; protection of human health or safety,
animal or plant life or health, or the environment; fundamental
climatic or other geographical factors; fundamental technological
or infrastructural problems.
6-52. Each Party recognises the importance of accepting the results of
conformity assessment procedures conducted in another Party
with a view to increasing efficiency, avoiding duplication, and
ensuring cost effectiveness of conformity assessments.
3. Each Party shall ensure, whenever possible, that results of
conformity assessment procedures in another Party are
accepted, even when those procedures differ from its own, unless
those procedures do not offer an assurance of conformity with
applicable technical regulations or standards equivalent to its own
procedures.
4. A Party shall, on request of another Party, explain its reasons for
not accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure
conducted in the other Party.
5. Each Party recognises that, depending on the situation of the
Party and the specific sectors involved, a broad range of
mechanisms exists to facilitate the acceptance of the results of
conformity assessment procedures conducted in another Party.
Such mechanisms may include:
6.
(a) mutual recognition agreements for the results of conformity
assessment procedures conducted by bodies in the
Parties concerned;
(b) cooperative
(voluntary)
arrangements
accreditation bodies or those between
assessment bodies in the Parties concerned;
(c) the use of accreditation to qualify conformity assessment
bodies, including through relevant multilateral agreements
or arrangements, to recognise the accreditation granted by
other Parties;
(d) the designation of conformity assessment bodies in
another Party;
(e) unilateral recognition by a Party of results of conformity
assessment procedures conducted in another Party; and

Upon reasonable request, the Parties concerned shall exchange
information or share experiences on the mechanisms referred to
6-6in paragraph 5, including their development and application, with
a view to facilitating the acceptance of the results of conformity
assessment procedures.
7. The Parties recognise the important role that relevant
international, including regional, organisations can play in
cooperation in the area of conformity assessment. In this regard,
each Party shall take into consideration the participation status or
membership in such organisations of relevant bodies in the
Parties in facilitating this cooperation.
8. The Parties agree to encourage cooperation between their
relevant conformity assessment bodies in working closer with a
view to facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment
results between Parties.
9. Each Party shall, whenever possible, permit the participation of
conformity assessment bodies in another Party in its conformity
assessment procedures under conditions no less favourable than
those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in the Party.
10. Where a Party permits participation of its conformity assessment
bodies and does not permit participation of conformity
assessment bodies in another Party in its conformity assessment
procedures, it shall, on request of that other Party, explain the
reason for its refusal decision.
Article 6.9: Cooperation
1. The Parties shall strengthen their cooperation in the field of
standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment
procedures, consistent with the objectives of this Chapter.
2. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, give positive
consideration to proposals for cooperation on matters of mutual
interest on standards, technical regulations, and conformity
assessment procedures.
3. Such cooperation, which shall be on mutually determined terms
and conditions, may include:
(a)
advice, technical assistance or capacity building relating to
the development and application of standards, technical
regulations, and conformity assessment procedures;
6-74.
(b) cooperation between conformity assessment bodies, both
governmental and non-governmental, in the Parties, on
matters of mutual interest;
(c) cooperation in areas of mutual interest in the work of
relevant regional and international bodies relating to the
development and application of standards and conformity
assessment procedures, such as enhancing participation
in the frameworks for mutual recognition developed by
relevant regional and international bodies;
(d) enhancing cooperation in the development and
improvement of standards, technical regulations, and
conformity assessment procedures; and
(e) strengthening communication and coordination in the
WTO TBT Committee and other relevant international or
regional fora.

to sector specific proposals for mutual benefit for cooperation
under this Chapter.
Article 6.10: Technical Discussions
1. When a Party considers the need to resolve an issue related to
trade and provisions under this Chapter, it may make a written
request for technical discussions. The requested Party shall
respond as early as possible to such a request.
2. The requested Party shall enter into technical discussions with the
requesting Party within 60 days, unless otherwise mutually
determined by the Parties concerned, with a view to reaching a
mutually satisfactory solution. Technical discussions may be

security arise or threaten to arise. Each Party shall take the
comments of another Party into account and shall endeavour to
provide responses to those comments upon request.
5. Each Party shall allow persons of another Party to participate in
consultation procedures that are available to the general public
for the development of technical regulations, national standards
and conformity assessment procedures by the Party, subject to
its laws and regulations, on terms no less favourable than those
accorded to its own persons.

determines, in conformity with the procedures specified in
this Article, that the transitional RCEP safeguard measure
continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious
injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence
that the domestic industry concerned is adjusting, provided
that the total period of application of a provisional and
transitional RCEP safeguard measure, including the period
of initial application and any extension thereof, shall not
exceed four years. Notwithstanding this provision, a Least
Developed Country Party may extend its transitional RCEP

import of an originating good for a period of one year from the
date on which the first tariff reduction or tariff elimination takes
effect for that originating good as committed under this
Agreement.
3. In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected
duration of a transitional RCEP safeguard measure exceeds one
year, the Party applying the transitional RCEP safeguard
measure shall progressively liberalise the transitional RCEP
safeguard measure at regular intervals during its period of
application.
7-54. When a Party terminates a transitional RCEP safeguard measure,
the rate of customs duty for the originating good subject to that

is longer.
Article 7.6: De Minimis Imports and Special Treatment
1. A provisional or transitional RCEP safeguard measure shall not
be applied to an originating good of a Party, as long as that
Party’s share of imports of the good concerned in the importing
Party does not exceed three per cent of the total imports of that
good from all the Parties, provided that those Parties with less
than three per cent import share collectively account for not more
than nine per cent.

be applied to an originating good of any Least Developed Country
Party.
Article 7.7: Compensation
1.
A Party proposing to apply or extend a transitional RCEP
safeguard measure shall, in consultation with the exporting
Parties that would be affected by such a measure, provide to
those exporting Parties mutually agreed, adequate means of
trade compensation in the form of concessions having
substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of
the additional customs duties expected to result from the
measure. The Party applying a transitional RCEP safeguard
measure shall provide those exporting Parties that would be
affected by such a measure with the opportunity to consult within
30 days of the date on which the transitional RCEP safeguard
measure was applied.
7-62. If the consultations referred to in paragraph 1 do not result in an
agreement on trade compensation within 30 days of the
commencement of such consultations, any Party against whose
good the transitional RCEP safeguard measure is applied may
suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions
to the trade in goods of the Party applying the transitional RCEP
safeguard measure.
3. A Party against whose good a transitional RCEP safeguard
measure is applied shall deliver a written notice to the Party
applying the transitional RCEP safeguard measure at least 30
days before it suspends the application of concessions in
accordance with paragraph 2.
4. The obligation to provide compensation under paragraph 1 and
the right to suspend the application of concessions in accordance
with paragraph 2 shall cease on the termination of the transitional
RCEP safeguard measure.
5. The right to suspend the application of concessions in accordance
with paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first three years
during which the transitional RCEP safeguard measure is in
effect, provided that the transitional RCEP safeguard measure
has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports
and that it conforms to this Agreement.
6. A Least Developed Country Party that applies or extends a
transitional RCEP safeguard measure shall not be requested for
any compensation by the affected Parties.
Article 7.8: Provisional RCEP Safeguard Measures
1.
In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage that
would be difficult to repair, an importing Party may apply a
provisional RCEP safeguard measure, which shall take the form
of the measures set out in subparagraph 1(a) or (b) of Article 7.2
(Application of Transitional RCEP Safeguard Measures),
pursuant to a preliminary determination by its competent
authorities that there is clear evidence that imports of an
originating good from another Party or Parties have increased as
the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under
this Agreement, and such increased imports have caused or are
threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry of the
importing Party.
7-72. A Party shall deliver a written notice to the other Parties prior to
applying a provisional RCEP safeguard measure. Consultations
with the Parties that have a substantial interest as exporters of the
good concerned on the application of the provisional RCEP
safeguard measure shall be initiated immediately after the
provisional RCEP safeguard measure is applied.
3. The duration of any provisional RCEP safeguard measure shall
not exceed 200 days, during which period the Party applying that
provisional RCEP safeguard measure shall comply with the
requirements of paragraph 1 of Article 7.4 (Investigation
Procedures). If the investigation referred to in paragraph 1 of
Article 7.4 (Investigation Procedures) does not result in a finding
that the requirements of Article 7.2 (Application of Transitional
RCEP Safeguard Measures) are met, the Party applying the
provisional RCEP safeguard measure shall promptly refund any
additional customs duties collected as a result of the provisional
RCEP safeguard measure. For greater certainty, the duration of
any provisional RCEP safeguard measure shall be counted as
part of the total period prescribed by subparagraph 1(b) of Article
7.5 (Scope and Duration of Transitional RCEP Safeguard
Measures).
4. Paragraph 2 of Article 7.2 (Application of Transitional RCEP
Safeguard Measures), paragraph 4 of Article 7.5 (Scope and

confidential file for each investigation and review containing:
(a)
all non-confidential documents which are part of the record
of the investigation or review; and

from another Party, the Party shall endeavour to provide written
notice to the other Party of its receipt of the application at least
seven days before initiating such an anti-dumping investigation.
2. On receipt by a Party’s competent authorities of a properly
documented countervailing duty application with respect to

comments, if the comments have been received in the time frames
established by that Party’s laws and regulations or by its investigating
authorities.
Article 7.15: Treatment of Confidential Information
The investigating authorities of a Party shall require interested parties
providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries

7-13ANNEX 7A
PRACTICES RELATING TO ANTI-DUMPING AND
COUNTERVAILING DUTY PROCEEDINGS 1
The Parties recognise the right of the Parties to apply trade remedy
measures consistent with Article VI of GATT 1994, the AD Agreement,
and the SCM Agreement. The following practices 2 are practised by
some Parties in accordance with their laws and regulations and may
promote the goals of transparency and due process in trade remedy
proceedings.
Opportunity to Remedy or Explain Deficiency in Request for
Information
1.
If, in an anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigation, a
Party’s investigating authorities determine that an interested
party’s timely response to a request for information does not
comply with the request, the investigating authorities:
(a) inform that interested party that submitted the response of
the nature of the deficiency; and
(b) to the extent practicable in light of the time-limits
established to complete the anti-dumping or countervailing
duty investigations, provide that interested party with an
opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency.
If that interested party submits further information in response to
the deficiency and the investigating authorities find such response
not satisfactory, or the response is not submitted within the
applicable time-limits, and if the investigating authorities disregard
all or part of the original and subsequent responses, the
investigating authorities explain the reasons for disregarding the
responses in the determination or other written document.
1
This Annex, and any matter arising under the Annex, shall not be subject to dispute
settlement under this Agreement and shall not prejudice the rights of the Parties to
apply the trade remedy measures consistent with Article VI of GATT 1994, the AD
Agreement, and the SCM Agreement.
2
The practices included in this Annex do not constitute a comprehensive list of
practices relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duty proceedings. No inference
shall be drawn from the inclusion or exclusion of a particular aspect of such
proceedings in this Annex.
7A-1Undertakings
2. After the importing Party’s investigating authorities initiate an anti-
dumping or countervailing duty investigation, on request of the
exporting Party, the importing Party transmits to the exporting
Party’s embassy located in the importing Party or the exporting
Party’s competent authorities written information regarding the
importing Party’s procedures for requesting its authorities to
consider a price undertaking, including the time frames for
offering and concluding any such undertaking.
3. In an anti-dumping investigation, where the importing Party’s
investigating authorities have made a preliminary affirmative
determination of dumping and injury caused by such dumping, the
importing Party affords due consideration, and provides an
opportunity for consultations, to exporters of the exporting Party
regarding the proposed price undertaking which, if accepted,
results in suspension of the investigation without imposition of
anti-dumping duties, through the means provided for in the
importing Party’s laws, regulations, and procedures.
4. In a countervailing duty investigation, where the importing Party’s
investigating authorities have made a preliminary affirmative
determination of subsidisation and injury caused by such
subsidisation, the importing Party affords due consideration, and
provides an opportunity for consultations, to the exporting Party
and its exporters, regarding the proposed undertaking which, if
accepted, results in suspension of the investigation without
imposition of countervailing duties, through the means provided
for in the importing Party’s laws, regulations, and procedures.
Public Notice and Explanation of Determination
5. When a public notice of final determination referred to in
paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the AD Agreement is given, the public
notice sets forth, or otherwise make available through a separate
report, in sufficient detail, the findings and conclusions reached
on all issues of fact and law considered material by the
investigating authorities. Such findings and conclusions included
in the public notice or the separate report also include the
rationale behind the findings and conclusions of the investigating
authorities.
6. For the purposes of paragraph 5 and subject to the protection of
confidential information, the public notice or the separate report
contains in particular:
7A-27.
(a) the margins of dumping established, an explanation of the
basis upon which normal values and export prices were
established, and of the methodology used in the
comparison of the export prices and normal values
including any adjustments; and
(b) information relevant to the injury determination, including
information concerning the volume and the effect of the
dumped imports on prices in the domestic market for like
goods, the detailed methodology used in the calculations
of price undercutting, the consequent impact of the
dumped imports on the domestic industry, and the
demonstration of a causal relationship including the
examination of factors other than the dumped imports as
referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 3 of the AD Agreement.
The public notice or the separate report sets forth the reasons for
the acceptance or rejection of relevant arguments or claims made
by the exporters and importers referred to in subparagraph 2.2 of
Article 12 of the AD Agreement in sufficient detail to permit a
reasonable understanding of the investigating authorities’
reasons for the acceptance or rejection and to allow the exporters
and importers to assess whether the investigating authorities’
treatment of those arguments or claims were consistent with laws
and regulations of the Party of the investigating authorities, and
the WTO Agreement.

shall identify in its Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific
Commitments for Services) sectors or subsectors for future
liberalisation with “FL”. In these sectors and subsectors, any

referred to in subparagraphs 1(a) and (b) shall be limited to
existing measures of that Party.

manner that reduces or eliminates the inconsistency of that
measure with Article 8.4 (National Treatment) or Article 8.5
(Market Access), as it existed immediately before the
amendment, that Party shall not subsequently amend that
measure in a manner that increases the measure’s inconsistency
with Article 8.4 (National Treatment) or Article 8.5 (Market
Access).
5. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, Least Developed Country Parties
which are Member States of ASEAN are not obliged to identify
8-11sectors or subsectors for future liberalisation. These Parties may,
however, do so on a voluntary basis.

Article 8.10: Transparency List
1. A Party making commitments in accordance with Article 8.7
(Schedules of Specific Commitments) that opts under paragraph
2 of Article 8.3 (Scheduling of Commitments) to make
commitments under this Article shall prepare, forward to the other
Parties, and make publicly available on the internet, a non-binding
transparency list of its existing measures maintained at the central
government level which are inconsistent with Article 8.4 (National
Treatment) or Article 8.5 (Market Access) (hereinafter referred to
as “Transparency List” in this Chapter). Such a Transparency List
shall cover the sectors in which the Party has undertaken specific
commitments in this Chapter.
2. A Party’s Transparency List is made solely for the purposes of
transparency, and shall be accurate at the time of submission and
shall not affect the rights and obligations of that Party under this
Chapter. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from
8-13amending its measures referred to in paragraph 1. If there are
any discrepancies between a Party’s Transparency List and its
Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific Commitments for
Services), the latter shall prevail.
3.
4.
5.

(b) the type of inconsistency (National Treatment or Market
Access);
(c) the legal source or authority of the measure; and

arising out of a Transparency List.
Article 8.11: Local Presence
A Party making commitments in accordance with Article 8.8 (Schedules
of Non-Conforming Measures) shall not require a service supplier of
another Party to establish or maintain a representative office, a branch,
or any form of juridical person, or to be resident, in its territory as a
condition for the supply of a service as described in subparagraph (r)(i),
(ii), or (iv) of Article 8.1 (Definitions), subject to its non-conforming
measures as provided in Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming
Measures).
Article 8.12: Transition
1.
A Party making commitments in accordance with Article 8.7
(Schedules of Specific Commitments) (hereinafter referred to as
8-14a “transitioning Party” in this Article) shall submit a proposed
Schedule of Non-Conforming Measures (hereinafter referred to
as a “Proposed Schedule” in this Article) that accords with Article
8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) 9 to the Committee
on Services and Investment for circulation to the other Parties, no
later than three years, or for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar,
no later than 12 years, after the date of entry into force of this
Agreement.
2. The commitments contained in each transitioning Party’s
Proposed Schedule shall provide an equivalent or a greater level
of liberalisation and shall not result in a decrease in the level of
commitments as compared to the transitioning Party’s
commitments, made in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8.3
(Scheduling of Commitments).
3. The Parties shall consider the Proposed Schedule for the
purposes of verification and clarification, and shall have the
opportunity to make comments to ensure that the Proposed
Schedule meets the requirements specified in paragraph 2. The
verification and clarification process shall not entitle the Parties to
negotiate specific new commitments. 10 The transitioning Party
shall have the opportunity to respond to any comments received
and to modify or revise its Proposed Schedule, as may be
necessary, with a view to resolving any ambiguities, omissions, or
errors in its Proposed Schedule.
4. Upon completion of the verification and clarification process
referred to in paragraph 3, the Committee on Services and
Investment may adopt, by consensus, the transitioning Party’s
Proposed Schedule, which shall replace the transitioning Party’s
Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific Commitments for
Services) subject to paragraph 5 (hereinafter referred to as an
“Adopted Schedule” in this Article). The transitioning Party shall
then submit its Adopted Schedule to the Depositary and notify it
9
For the purposes of a Proposed Schedule referred to in this paragraph and an
Adopted Schedule referred to in paragraph 4, the references to “existing” in
subparagraph 1(a) of Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) shall be
deemed to mean “in effect on the date of entry into force of the Party’s Adopted
Schedule”.
10
For greater certainty, nothing in this Article requires a Party to make commitments
under Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) in respect of a specific sector or
subsector.
8-15in writing of the completion of any applicable domestic
processes. 11
5. Notwithstanding Article 20.4 (Amendments), once a transitioning
Party has submitted its Adopted Schedule to the Depositary and
notified it in writing of the completion of any applicable domestic
processes, the transitioning Party’s Adopted Schedule shall enter
into force between the transitioning Party and each other Party 60
days after the date of the transitioning Party’s notification to the
Depositary. However, if a Party notifies the Depositary in writing
within 60 days of the date of the transitioning Party’s notification
to the Depositary that the Adopted Schedule will not enter into
force for that Party within 60 days of the transitioning Party’s
notification to the Depositary, the Adopted Schedule shall enter
into force between the transitioning Party and that Party on the
date on which that Party notifies the Depositary in writing of the
completion of its applicable domestic processes, or on such other
date as the transitioning Party and that Party may decide.
6. For greater certainty, a transitioning Party’s Schedule in Annex II
(Schedules of Specific Commitments for Services) under Article
8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments) shall remain in force
between the transitioning Party and each other Party until the
transitioning Party’s Adopted Schedule has entered into force for
that other Party.
7. The process referred to in paragraphs 1 through 4 shall be
completed no later than six years, or for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and
Myanmar, no later than 15 years, after the date of entry into force
of this Agreement.
Article 8.13: Modification of Schedules
1.
A Party that has made commitments in accordance with Article
8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments) (hereinafter referred to
as a “modifying Party” in this Article) may modify or withdraw any
commitment in its Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific
Commitments for Services), other than commitments in sectors or
11
For greater certainty, this paragraph does not exclude the possibility of a transitioning
Party, when undertaking its applicable domestic processes, requesting consultations
among the Parties regarding potential revisions to its Adopted Schedule, and
requesting the Committee on Services and Investment to adopt, by consensus, a
revised Adopted Schedule for submission by the transitioning Party to the Depositary
in accordance with this paragraph.
8-16subsectors indicated with an “FL”, at any time after three years
from the date on which that commitment has entered into force,
provided that it complies with this Article and that:
(a) it notifies the Committee on Services and Investment of its
intention to modify or withdraw a commitment no later than
three months before the intended date of implementation
of the modification or withdrawal; and
(b) it enters into negotiations with any requesting Party, with a
view to reaching agreement on any necessary
compensatory adjustment.
2. In achieving a compensatory adjustment through the negotiations
referred to in subparagraph 1(b), the Parties concerned shall
endeavour to maintain a general level of mutually advantageous
commitments no less favourable to trade than that provided for in
the modifying Party’s Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific
Commitments for Services) prior to such negotiations.
3. Any compensatory adjustment made pursuant to this Article shall
be accorded on a non-discriminatory basis to all Parties.
4. If the Parties concerned are unable to reach an agreement on the
compensatory adjustment within three months following the last
date on which a request under subparagraph 1(b) has been
made, or another period agreed by the modifying Party and each
requesting Party, a requesting Party may refer the matter to
arbitration. Any Party that wishes to enforce a right that it may
have to compensation must participate in the arbitration. The
modifying Party may not modify or withdraw its commitment until
it has made compensatory adjustments in conformity with the
findings of the arbitration.
5. Arbitrations undertaken pursuant to paragraph 4 shall be
conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in
paragraphs 7 through 19 of Procedures for the Implementation of
Article XXI of the General Agreement on Trade in Services
adopted on 19 July 1999(S/L/80), as may be amended,
(hereinafter referred to as “the GATS Article XXI Procedures” in
this Chapter), which shall apply mutatis mutandis, unless
otherwise decided by the Committee on Services and Investment
under paragraph 10 or unless the parties to the arbitration agree
otherwise.
8-176. If the modifying Party implements its proposed modification or
withdrawal and does not comply with the findings of the
arbitration, any Party that participated in the arbitration may
modify or withdraw substantially equivalent benefits in conformity
with those findings. Such a modification or withdrawal may be
implemented solely with respect to the modifying Party.
7. If no Party has requested:
(a) negotiations under subparagraph 1(b) within 45 days of the
date of a notification made pursuant to subparagraph 1(a);
or
(b) arbitration pursuant to paragraph 4,
the modifying Party shall be free to implement its proposed
modification or withdrawal, notwithstanding Article 20.4
(Amendments), in accordance with the procedures set out in
paragraphs 20 through 22 of the GATS Article XXI Procedures,
which shall apply mutatis mutandis, unless otherwise decided by
the Committee on Services and Investment under paragraph 10.
8.
For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of paragraphs 5 and
7, references in the GATS Article XXI Procedures to:
(a) “the Secretariat” and “the Council for Trade in Services”
shall be read as references to the Committee on Services
and Investment;
(b) “Article XXI” shall be read as references to Article 8.13
(Modification of Schedules); and
(c) “Members of the WTO” shall be read as references to the
Parties.
9. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the
GATS Article XXI Procedures, this Agreement shall prevail to the
extent of the inconsistency.
10. The Committee on Services and Investment may establish or
amend procedures for the modification or withdrawal of a Party’s
commitments in its Schedule in Annex II (Schedules of Specific
Commitments for Services) or the conduct of arbitration, under
this Article. Any Party that seeks to modify or withdraw its
commitments under this Article shall do so in accordance with any
such procedures.
8-18Article 8.14: Transparency
1. The Parties recognise that transparent measures governing trade
in services are important in facilitating the ability of service
suppliers to gain access to, and operate in, each other’s markets.
Each Party shall promote regulatory transparency in trade in
services.
2. Each Party shall publish promptly and, except in emergency
situations, at the latest by the time of their entry into force:
(a) all relevant measures of general application affecting trade
in services; and
(b) all international agreements pertaining to or affecting trade
in services to which a Party is a signatory.
3. To the extent possible, each Party shall make the measures and
international agreements referred to in paragraph 2 publicly
available on the internet and, to the extent provided under its legal
framework, in the English language.
4. Where publication referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 is not
practicable, such information 12 shall be made otherwise publicly
available.
5. Each Party shall designate a contact point to facilitate
communications among the Parties on any matter covered by this
Chapter. On request of another Party, the contact point shall:
6.
(a) identify the office or official responsible for the relevant
matter; and
(b) assist as necessary in facilitating communications with the
requesting Party with respect to that matter.
Each Party shall respond promptly to any request by any other
Party for specific information on:
(a)
any measures referred to in subparagraph 2(a) or
international agreements referred to in subparagraph 2(b);
and
12
For greater certainty, such information may be published in each Party’s chosen
language.
8-19(b)
any new, or any changes to existing, laws, regulations or
administrative guidelines which significantly affect trade in
services.
Article 8.15: Domestic Regulation
1. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application
affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable,
objective, and impartial manner.
2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable
judicial, arbitral, or administrative tribunals or procedures which
provide, on request of an affected service supplier, for the prompt
review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for,
administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such
procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the
administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the
procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.
3. Nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to require a Party to
institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be
inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its
legal system.
4. If the results of the negotiations related to paragraph 4 of Article
VI of GATS enter into effect, the Parties shall review the results
of such negotiations and shall amend this Article as appropriate,
after consultation among the Parties to bring the results of such
negotiations into effect under this Chapter.
5. With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification
requirements and procedures, technical standards, and licensing
requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in
services, while recognising the right to regulate and to introduce
new regulations on the supply of services in order to meet its
policy objectives, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that any
such measures that it adopts or maintains are:
(a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as
competence and the ability to supply the service;
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality
of the service; and
8-20(c)
in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a
restriction on the supply of the service.
6. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations
under subparagraph 5(a), international standards of relevant
international organisations 13 applied by that Party shall be taken
into account.
7. Where a Party requires authorisation for the supply of a service,
it shall ensure that its competent authorities:
(a) ensure that any authorisation fees charged for the
completion of relevant application procedures are
reasonable, transparent, and do not in themselves restrict
the supply of a service. For the purposes of this
subparagraph, authorisation fees do not include fees for
the use of natural resources, payment for auction,
tendering, or other non-discriminatory means of awarding
concessions, or mandated contributions to universal
services provision;
(b) within a reasonable period of time after the submission of
an application considered complete under its laws and
regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning
the application;
(c) to the extent practicable, establish an indicative time frame
for processing of an application;
(d) on request of the applicant, provide, without undue delay,
information concerning the status of the application;
(e) in the case of an incomplete application and on request of
the applicant, identify, where practicable, all the additional
information that is required to complete the application, and
provide the opportunity to remedy deficiencies within a
reasonable time frame;
(f) if an application is terminated or denied, to the extent
possible and without undue delay, inform the applicant in
writing of the reasons for such action. The applicant will

“Relevant international organisations” refers to international bodies whose
membership is open to the relevant bodies of the Parties.
8-21have the possibility of resubmitting, at its discretion, a new
application;
8.
(g) to the extent permissible under its laws and regulations, do
not require physical presence in the territory of a Party for
the submission of an application for a licence or
qualification;
(h) endeavour to accept applications in electronic format under
the equivalent conditions of authenticity as paper
submissions, in accordance with its laws and regulations;
and
(i) where they deem appropriate, accept copies of documents
authenticated in accordance with its laws and regulations,
in place of original documents.
Each Party shall provide adequate procedures to verify the
competence of professionals of another Party. If licensing or
qualification requirements include the completion of an
examination, each Party shall, to the extent practicable, ensure
that:
(a) the examination is scheduled at reasonable intervals; and
(b) a reasonable period of time is provided to enable interested
persons to submit an application.
9. Each Party shall, subject to its laws and regulations, permit
service suppliers of another Party to use, without undue
restrictions, the business names under which they trade in the
territory of that other Party.
10. Paragraphs 1 through 9 shall not apply to a sector or measure to
the extent that such sector or measure is not subject to Article 8.4
(National Treatment) or Article 8.5 (Market Access) by reason of
a Party’s commitments made in accordance with either Article 8.7
(Schedules of Specific Commitments) or Article 8.8 (Schedules of
Non-Conforming Measures).
Article 8.16: Recognition
1.
For the purposes of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, of its
standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing, or certification
of service suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph
8-224, a Party may recognise the education or experience obtained,
requirements met, or licences or certifications granted in a
particular country. Such recognition, which may be achieved
through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an
agreement or arrangement with the country concerned, or may be
accorded autonomously.
2. A Party that is party to an agreement or arrangement of the type
referred to in paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford
adequate opportunity for the other Parties, upon request, to
negotiate their accession to such an agreement or arrangement,
or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords
recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for
any other Party to demonstrate that education, experience,
licences, or certifications obtained or requirements met in that
other Party’s territory should be recognised.
3. Nothing in Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall be
construed to require any Party to accord such recognition to the
education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences
or certifications granted in another Party.
4. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would
constitute a means of discrimination between other Parties in the
application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation,
licensing, or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised
restriction on trade in services.
5. Where appropriate, recognition should be based on multilaterally
agreed criteria. In appropriate cases, Parties shall work in
cooperation with relevant inter-governmental and non-
governmental organisations towards the establishment and
adoption of common international standards and criteria for
recognition and common international standards for the practice
of relevant services trades and professions.
6. As set out in Annex 8C (Professional Services), each Party shall
endeavour to facilitate trade in professional services, including
through encouraging relevant bodies in its territory to enter into
negotiations for agreements or arrangements on recognition.
Article 8.17: Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1.
Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service
in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in
8-23the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that Party’s
obligations under Article 8.4 (National Treatment) and Article 8.5
(Market Access).
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier of a service competes, either
directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service
outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to
that Party’s commitments, that Party shall ensure that such a
supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory
in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.
3. If a Party has a reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a
service of any other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with
paragraph 1 or 2, it may request that other Party establishing,
maintaining, or authorising such a supplier to provide specific
information concerning the relevant operations.
4. This Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service
suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:
(a) authorises or establishes a small number of service
suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers
in its territory.
Article 8.18: Business Practices
1. The Parties recognise that certain business practices of service
suppliers, other than those falling under Article 8.17 (Monopolies
and Exclusive Service Suppliers), may restrain competition and
thereby restrict trade in services.
2. Each Party shall, on request of any other Party, enter into
consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in
paragraph 1.
The requested Party shall accord full and
sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall cooperate
through the supply of publicly available non-confidential
information of relevance to the matter in question. The requested
Party may also provide other information available to the
requesting Party, subject to its laws and regulations and to the
conclusion of a satisfactory agreement concerning the
safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.
8-24Article 8.19: Payments and Transfers
1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 17.15
(Measures to Safeguard the Balance of Payments), a Party shall
not apply restrictions on international transfers or payments for
current transactions relating to its commitments.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of a
Party as a member of the IMF under the IMF Articles of
Agreement, as may be amended, including the use of exchange
actions which are in conformity with the IMF Articles of
Agreement, as may be amended, provided that the Party shall not
impose restrictions on any capital transaction inconsistently with
its commitments under this Chapter regarding such transactions,
except under Article 17.15 (Measures to Safeguard the Balance
of Payments) or on request of the IMF.
Article 8.20: Denial of Benefits
1.
2.
A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter:
(a) to the supply of any service, if it establishes that the service
is supplied from or in the territory of a non-Party;
(b) to a service supplier that is a juridical person, if it
establishes that it is not a service supplier of another Party;
(c) in the case of the supply of a maritime transport service, if
it establishes that the service is supplied:
(i) by a vessel registered under the laws and
regulations of a non-Party; and
(ii) by a person of a non-Party which operates or uses
the vessel in whole or in part.
A Party may deny the benefit of this Chapter to a service supplier
of another Party, if the service supplier is a juridical person owned
or controlled by persons of a non-Party, and the denying Party
adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a
person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the juridical
person or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of
this Chapter were accorded to the juridical person.
8-25Article 8.21: Safeguard Measures
1. The Parties shall review the incorporation of safeguard measures
pending any further developments in the multilateral fora pursuant
to Article X of GATS.
2. In the event that a Party encounters difficulties in the
implementation of its commitments under this Chapter, that Party
may request consultations with the other Parties to address such
difficulties.
Article 8.22: Subsidies
1. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(b) of Article 8.2 (Scope), the Parties
shall review the issue of disciplines on subsidies related to trade
in services in light of any disciplines agreed under Article XV of
GATS with a view to their incorporation into this Chapter.
2. A Party which considers that it is adversely affected by a subsidy
of another Party related to trade in services may request
consultations with that other Party on such matters. The
requested Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to such a
request.
3. No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter
19 (Dispute Settlement) for any request made or consultations
held under this Article, or any other dispute arising under this
Article.
Article 8.23: Increasing Participation of Least Developed Country
Parties which are Member States of ASEAN
To increase the participation of Least Developed Country Parties which
are Member States of ASEAN, this Chapter shall facilitate:
(a) strengthening their domestic services capacity and their
efficiency and competitiveness, inter alia, through access
to technology on a commercial basis;
(b) improving their access to distribution channels and
information networks; and
8-26(c)
the liberalisation of market access in sectors and modes of
supply of export interest to them, and the provision of
market access in sectors beneficial to them.
Article 8.24: Review of Commitments
The Parties shall review the commitments on trade in services as
necessary, but no later than the general review of this Agreement under
Article 20.8 (General Review), with a view to further improving
commitments under this Chapter so as to progressively liberalise trade
in services among the Parties.
Article 8.25: Cooperation
The Parties shall strengthen cooperation efforts in sectors, including
sectors which are not covered by current cooperation arrangements.
The Parties shall discuss and agree on the sectors for cooperation and
develop cooperation programmes in these sectors in order to improve
their domestic services capacity and their efficiency and
competitiveness.

provision and transfer of financial information and financial data

Party shall grant financial institutions of another Party established in its
territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public

2. In this respect, the Parties recognise that a Party may:
3.
(a) engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue
that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that
has already arisen in the market; or
(b) rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect
to market segments that are, or are likely to be, competitive
or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided
by suppliers of telecommunications services that do not

For greater certainty, a Party that refrains from engaging in

Each Party shall ensure that a supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services in its territory does not
use or provide commercially sensitive or confidential information
of, or relating to, users acquired as a result of interconnection
arrangements other than for the purpose of providing these
services.
Obligations relating to major suppliers
3.
4.
Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory
provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of
suppliers of public telecommunications networks and services of
another Party at any technically feasible point in the major
supplier’s network. Such interconnection shall be provided:
(a) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including
technical standards and specifications) and rates; 6

major supplier for its own like services, for like services of
non-affiliated service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or
other affiliates;
(c) on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions (including
technical standards and specifications) and at cost-
oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having

components or facilities that it does not require for the
services to be provided; and
(d) upon request, at points in addition to the network
termination points offered to the majority of suppliers of
public telecommunications networks and services, subject
to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary
additional facilities.
Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory
provides suppliers of public telecommunications services of
another Party with the opportunity to interconnect their facilities
and equipment with those of the major supplier through at least

telecommunications regulatory body or any other
interconnection offer containing the rates, terms and
conditions that the major supplier offers generally to
suppliers of public telecommunications services;
(b) the terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement
that is in effect; or
(c) a new interconnection agreement through commercial
negotiation.

suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of another
Party with leased circuit services that are public telecommunications
services, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at rates that
are reasonable, non-discriminatory, and transparent.
Article 11: Co-location
1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier which has control
over essential facilities in its territory allows suppliers of public
telecommunications networks or services of another Party
physical co-location of their equipment necessary for
interconnection on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions
(including technical feasibility and space availability where
applicable) and at rates that are reasonable, non-discriminatory,
and transparent.
2. Where physical co-location is not practical for technical reasons
or because of space limitations, each Party shall endeavour to
ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides an alternative
solution, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at
8B-9rates that are reasonable, non-discriminatory, and transparent.
3.
A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and
regulations, which premises owned or controlled by major
suppliers in its territory are subject to paragraphs 1 and 2, having
regard to factors such as the state of competition in the market
where co-location is required, and whether such premises can
feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to
provide a competing service.
Article 12: Independent Telecommunications Regulatory Body
1. Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory
body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of
public telecommunications services.
2. Each Party shall ensure that the regulatory decisions of, and the
procedures used by, its telecommunications regulatory body are
impartial with respect to all market participants.
Article 13: Universal Service
Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service
obligations it wishes to maintain. Such obligations shall not be regarded

transparent, non-discriminatory, and competitively neutral manner, and
are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal
service defined by the Party.
Article 14: Licensing

and non-discriminatory manner.
Spectrum
2. Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of
allocated frequency bands, but shall not be required to provide
detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific
government uses.
3. For greater certainty, a Party’s measures allocating and assigning
spectrum and managing frequency are not measures that are per
se inconsistent with Article 8.5 (Market Access). Accordingly,
each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and
frequency management policies that may have the effect of
limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications
networks or services, provided that the Party does so in a manner
consistent with other provisions of Chapter 8 (Trade in Services).
Such right includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking
into account current and future needs and spectrum availability.
4. When making a spectrum allocation for commercial
telecommunications services, each Party shall endeavour to rely
on an open and transparent process that considers the public
interest, including the promotion of competition. Each Party shall
8B-11endeavour to rely generally on market-based approaches in
assigning spectrum for terrestrial commercial telecommunications
services, if appropriate. In this regard, each Party may use
mechanisms such as auctions, administrative incentive pricing, or
unlicensed use, if appropriate, to assign spectrum for commercial
use.

Each Party shall ensure that a supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services of another Party
established in the territory of the former Party is afforded access
to telephone numbers in a non-discriminatory manner.
Article 16: Transparency
1. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that when its
telecommunications regulatory body seeks input on a proposal for
a law or regulation, that body provides relevant suppliers of public
telecommunications networks or services of another Party
operating in its territory an opportunity to comment.
2. Each Party shall ensure that relevant information on conditions
affecting access to and use of public telecommunications
networks or services is publicly available, including:
(a) tariffs and other terms and conditions of service;

and services and undertake to promote such standards through the work
of relevant international bodies, including the International
Telecommunication Union and the International Organization for
Standardization.
Article 18: International Submarine Cable Systems
Where a Party has authorised a supplier of public telecommunications
networks or services in its territory to operate an international submarine
cable system as a public telecommunications network or service, that
Party shall ensure that such supplier accords the suppliers of public
telecommunications networks or services of another Party reasonable
and non-discriminatory treatment for access to the international
submarine cable system. 8, 9, 10
8
For greater certainty, a Party may determine the point at which access to the
international submarine cable system is to be provided.
9
For greater certainty, this Article does not prohibit a Party from requiring a supplier of
public telecommunications networks or services to comply with relevant measures
including licensing requirements, provided that such measures are not used as a
means of avoiding the Party’s obligations under this Article.
10
For Viet Nam,
(i) this Article shall only apply to the international submarine cable landing
stations in its territory;
(ii) this Article shall only apply to a major supplier that owns, controls, or
operates the international submarine cable system including landing
stations in its territory;

public telecommunications networks or services to comply with
relevant measures, including licensing requirements, provided that
such measures are not used as a means of preventing access to the
international submarine cable system.
8B-13Article 19: Unbundling of Network Elements
Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that a major supplier in its territory
offers access to network elements on an unbundled basis on terms and
conditions that are reasonable, non-discriminatory, and transparent for
the supply of public telecommunications services. A Party may
determine the network elements required to be made available in its
territory, and the suppliers that may obtain those elements, in
accordance with its laws and regulations. 11
Article 20: Access to Poles, Ducts, and Conduits
1. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that a major supplier in its
territory provides access to poles, ducts, conduits, or any other
structures as determined by the Party, owned or controlled by the
major supplier, to suppliers of public telecommunications services
of another Party in the Party’s territory, on a timely basis, and on
terms and conditions and at rates that are reasonable, non-
discriminatory, and transparent, subject to technical feasibility.
2. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and
regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits, or any other structures to
which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access
in accordance with paragraph 1. When the Party makes this
determination, it shall take into account factors such as the
competitive effect of lack of such access, whether such structures
can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible
manner in order to provide a competitive service, or other
specified public interest factors.
Article 21: Flexibility in the Choice of Technology
1. A Party shall not prevent suppliers of public telecommunications
networks or services from having the flexibility to choose the
technologies that they use to supply their services.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may apply a measure that
limits the technologies that a supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services may use to supply its
services, provided that the measure is designed to achieve a

Article 22: International Mobile Roaming
1. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on promoting
transparent and reasonable rates for international mobile roaming
services that can help promote the growth of trade among the
Parties and enhance consumer welfare.
2. A Party may take steps to enhance transparency and competition
with respect to international mobile roaming services, such as:
(a) ensuring that information regarding retail rates is easily
accessible to consumers; and
(b) minimising impediments to roaming, whereby consumers
when visiting the territory of a Party from the territory of
another Party can access telecommunications services
using the device of their choice.
3. The Parties recognise that a Party, where it has the authority to
do so, may choose to promote competition with respect to
international mobile roaming rates including through commercial
arrangements, or to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates
for wholesale or retail international roaming services with a view
to ensuring that the rates are reasonable. If a Party considers it
appropriate, it may cooperate on and implement mechanisms with
other Parties to facilitate the implementation of those measures,
including by entering into arrangements with those Parties.
4. If a Party (hereinafter referred to as “the first Party” in this
paragraph) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale
or retail international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that
a supplier of public telecommunications services of another Party
(hereinafter referred to as “the second Party” in this paragraph)
has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale or
retail international mobile roaming services for its customers
roaming in the territory of the first Party if the second Party has
entered into an arrangement with the first Party to reciprocally
regulate rates or conditions for wholesale or retail international
8B-15mobile roaming services for suppliers of the two Parties. 12 The
first Party may require suppliers of the second Party to fully utilise
commercial negotiations to reach agreement on the terms for
accessing such rates or conditions.
5. A Party that ensures access to regulated rates or conditions for
wholesale or retail international mobile roaming services in
accordance with paragraph 4, shall be deemed to be in
compliance with Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment),
Article 4 (Access and Use), and Article 7 (Treatment by Major
Suppliers), with respect to international mobile roaming services.
6. Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to regulate rates or
conditions for international mobile roaming services.
Article 23: Resolution of Telecommunications Disputes
1. Each Party shall ensure that a supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services of another Party may
have timely recourse to its telecommunications regulatory body or
dispute resolution body to resolve disputes arising under this
Annex in accordance with its laws and regulations.
2. Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services aggrieved by a final
determination or decision of its relevant telecommunications
12
For greater certainty:
(a) no Party shall, solely on the basis of any obligations owed to it by the
first Party under a most-favoured-nation provision, or under a
telecommunications-specific non-discrimination provision, in any
international trade agreement, seek or obtain for its suppliers the
access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale or retail
international mobile roaming services that is provided under this
Article.
(b) access to the rates or conditions regulated by the first Party shall be
available to a supplier of the second Party only if the regulated rates
or conditions are reasonably comparable to those reciprocally
regulated under the arrangement. The telecommunications regulatory
body of the first Party shall, in the case of a disagreement, determine
whether the rates or conditions are reasonably comparable. For the
purposes of this footnote, “rates or conditions that are reasonably
comparable” means rates or conditions agreed to be such by the
relevant suppliers or, in the case of a disagreement, determined to be
such by the telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party.
8B-16regulatory body may obtain a review of such determination or
decision in accordance with its laws and regulations.
3.
No Party shall permit the making of an application for review to
constitute grounds for non-compliance with the determination or
decision of its telecommunications regulatory body, unless its
relevant body determines otherwise.
8B-17ANNEX 8C
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
1. Each Party shall consult with relevant bodies in its territory to seek
to identify professional services where two or more Parties are
mutually interested in establishing dialogue on issues that relate
to the recognition of professional qualifications, licensing, or
registration.
2. Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to establish
dialogues with the relevant bodies of another Party or Parties, with
a view to recognising professional qualifications and facilitating
licensing or registration procedures.

the relevant bodies of another Party or Parties on any form of
arrangements for the mutual recognition of professional
qualifications, licensing, or registration in professional services
sectors of mutual interest.
4. Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to take into
account agreements that relate to professional services in the
development of agreements on the recognition of professional
qualifications, licensing, and registration.
5. A Party may consider, if feasible, based on a foreign service
supplier’s home licence or recognised professional body
membership, without the need for further written examination:
(a) taking steps to implement a temporary or project specific
licensing or registration regime; or
(b) granting such licence or registration, if appropriate.
That temporary or limited licence regime should not operate to
prevent a foreign service supplier from gaining a local licence
once that service supplier satisfies the applicable local licensing
requirements.
6.
To facilitate the activities referred to in paragraphs 1 through 3,
each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to work towards
the development of mutually acceptable professional standards
and criteria in mutually accepted areas, which may include:
8C-1(a) education;
(b) examinations;
(c) experience;
(d) conduct and ethics;
(e) professional development and re-certification;

international frameworks, where applicable, in developing
common standards and criteria for the relevant professions.
9. The Parties may periodically review the implementation of this
Annex through the Committee on Services and Investment.

INVESTMENT
Article 10.1: Definitions
For the purposes of this Chapter:
(a) covered investment means, with respect to a Party, an
investment in its territory of an investor of another Party in
existence as of the date of entry into force of this
Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded
thereafter, and which, where applicable, has been
admitted 1, 2 by the host Party, subject to its relevant laws,
regulations, and policies; 3
(b) freely usable currency means a freely usable currency as
determined by the IMF under the IMF Articles of
Agreement as may be amended;
(c) investment means every kind of asset that an investor
owns or controls, directly or indirectly, and that has the
characteristics of an investment, including such

include:
(i)
shares, stocks, and other forms of equity
participation in a juridical person, including rights
derived therefrom;
1
For Malaysia and Thailand, protection under this Chapter shall be accorded to
covered investments which, where applicable, have been specifically approved in
writing for protection by their respective competent authorities in accordance with their
respective laws, regulations, and policies.
2
For Cambodia, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, “has been admitted” means “has been
specifically registered or approved in writing, as the case may be”.

For the purposes of this definition, “policies” means those policies affecting an
investment that are endorsed and announced by the government of a Party in a written
form and made publicly available in a written form.
10-1(ii) bonds, debentures, loans, 4 and other debt
instruments of a juridical person and rights derived
therefrom; 5

pledges. 7
The term “investment” does not include an order or
judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action or an
arbitral proceeding.
4
A loan issued by a Party to another Party is not an investment.
5
Some forms of debt, such as bonds, debentures, and long-term notes, are more likely
to have the characteristics of an investment, while other forms of debt, such as claims
to payment that are immediately due and result from the sale of goods or services, are
less likely to have such characteristics.
6
For greater certainty, investment does not mean claims to money that arise solely
from:
(a) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services; or
(b) the extension of credit in connection with such commercial contracts.

For greater certainty, market share, market access, expected gains, and opportunities
for profit-making are not, by themselves, investments.

subparagraph, returns that are invested shall be treated as
an investment and any alteration of the form in which
assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their
character as an investment;

an investor that seeks to make, 8 is making, or has made
an investment in the territory of that Party, that is not an
investor of a Party;

a juridical person of a Party that seeks to make, 9 is making,
or has made an investment in the territory of another Party;

(g) juridical person of a Party means a juridical person
constituted or organised under the law of that Party, and a
8
For greater certainty, the Parties understand that an investor “seeks to make” an
investment when that investor has taken concrete action or actions to make an
investment. Where a notification or approval process is required for making an
investment, an investor that “seeks to make” an investment refers to an investor that
has initiated such notification or approval process.

investment. Where a notification or approval process is required for making an
investment, an investor that “seeks to make” an investment refers to an investor that
has initiated such notification or approval process.

For greater certainty, a branch of a juridical person does not have any right to make
any claim against any Party under this Agreement.

For greater certainty, the inclusion of a “branch” in the definition of “juridical person”
is without prejudice to a Party’s ability to treat a branch under its law as an entity that
has no independent legal existence and is not separately organised.

Agreement.

disposition of investments in its territory.
2. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party
under paragraph 1 means, with respect to a government other

most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by
that government to investors, and to the investments of investors,
of the Party of which it forms a part.
Article 10.4: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment 18, 19
1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment
no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to

territory.
2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less
favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to
investments in its territory of investors of any other Party or non-
Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of
investments.

For greater certainty, whether the treatment is accorded in “like circumstances” under
this Article depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant
treatment distinguishes between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate
public welfare objectives.

This Article shall not apply to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. The
treatment under this Article shall not be accorded to investors of Cambodia, Lao PDR,
Myanmar, and Viet Nam, and to covered investments of such investors.

this Article depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant
treatment distinguishes between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate
public welfare objectives.

and 2 does not encompass any international dispute resolution
procedures or mechanisms under other existing or future
international agreements.

1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security, in accordance with the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of
aliens.
2. For greater certainty:

(a) fair and equitable treatment requires each Party not to
deny justice in any legal or administrative proceedings;
(b) full protection and security requires each Party to take such
measures as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the

and
(c) the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security do not require treatment to be
accorded to covered investments in addition to or beyond
that which is required under the customary international
law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, and do not
create additional substantive rights.
A determination that there has been a breach of another provision
of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does
not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.

contract, in regard to any licence contract in existence at
the time the requirement is imposed or enforced, or any
future licence contract freely entered into between the
investor and a person in its territory, provided that the
requirement is imposed or enforced in a manner that
constitutes direct interference with that licence contract by

Party. 22 For greater certainty, this subparagraph does not
apply when the licence contract is concluded between the
investor and a Party.

covered investment appoint to a senior management position a
natural person of any particular nationality.
2. A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or

becomes effective, unless otherwise specified in the initial
approval by the relevant authorities.

Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that
falls within Article 5 of the TRIPS Agreement, and any measure
that is covered by an exception to, or derogation from, the
obligations imposed by Article 11.7 (National Treatment), or

prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that
prescribes special formalities in connection with covered

legally constituted under its laws or regulations, provided that
such formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded
by that Party to investors of another Party and covered
investments pursuant to this Chapter.
2. Notwithstanding Article 10.3 (National Treatment) and Article 10.4
(Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), a Party may require an
investor of another Party or its covered investment to provide
information concerning that investment solely for informational or
statistical purposes. The Party shall protect, to the extent
possible, any confidential information which has been provided
from any disclosure that would prejudice the legitimate
commercial interests or the competitive position of the investor or
the covered investment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or
disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good
faith application of its laws and regulations.
10-14Article 10.11: Compensation for Losses
Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and their covered
investments, with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to

of a covered investment, the other Party in whose territory the
covered investment was made shall recognise the subrogation or
transfer of any right or claim in respect of such covered
investment. The subrogated or transferred right or claim shall not
be greater than the original right or claim of the investor.
2. Where a Party or an agency designated by a Party has made a
payment to an investor of that Party and has taken over any right
or claim of the investor, that investor shall not pursue that right or
claim against the other Party in whose territory the covered
investment was made, unless that investor is authorised to act on
behalf of the Party making the payment or the agency designated
by that Party.
3. In the exercise of subrogated or transferred right or claim, a Party
or an agency designated by a Party exercising such right or claim
shall disclose the coverage of the claims arrangement with its

(a) receiving and, where appropriate, considering referring or
giving due consideration to complaints raised by investors

2.
The Parties shall conclude the discussions referred to in
paragraph 1 within three years from the date of commencement
of the discussions.
10-21ANNEX 10A
CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that “customary
international law” generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5
(Treatment of Investment), including in relation to the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, results from
a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense
of legal obligation.
10A-1ANNEX 10B
EXPROPRIATION
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:
1. An action or a series of related actions by a Party cannot
constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or
intangible property right or property interest 1 in a covered
investment.
2. Article 10.13 (Expropriation) addresses two situations:
3.
(a) the first situation is direct expropriation, where a covered
investment is nationalised or otherwise directly
expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright
seizure; and
(b) the second situation is where an action or a series of
related actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct
expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright
seizure.
The determination of whether an action or series of related actions
by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an expropriation
of the type referred to in subparagraph 2(b) requires a case-by-
case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:
(a) the economic impact of the government action, although
the fact that an action or a series of related actions by a
Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an
investment, standing alone, does not establish that such
an expropriation has occurred;
(b) whether the government action breaches the government’s
prior binding written commitment to the investor, whether
by contract, licence, or other legal document; and
1
For the purposes of this Annex, “property interest” refers to such property interest as
may be recognised under the laws and regulations of that Party.
10B-1(c)
4.
the character of the government action, including its
objective and context. 2
Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are
designed and applied to achieve legitimate public welfare
objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, public
morals, the environment, and real estate price stabilisation, do not
constitute expropriation of the type referred to in subparagraph
2(b).
2
For Korea, a relevant consideration could include whether the investor bears a
disproportionate burden, such as a special sacrifice that exceeds what the investor or
investment should be expected to endure for the public interest. This footnote does
not prejudice the determination of the character of the government action of any other
Party.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
SECTION A
GENERAL PROVISIONS AND BASIC PRINCIPLES
Article 11.1: Objectives
1.
2.
The objective of this Chapter is to reduce distortion and
impediments to trade and investment by promoting deeper
economic integration and cooperation through the effective and
adequate creation, utilisation, protection, and enforcement of
intellectual property rights, while recognising:
(a) the Parties’ different levels of economic development and
capacity, and differences in national legal systems;
(b) the need to promote innovation and creativity;
(c) the need to maintain an appropriate balance between the
rights of intellectual property right holders and the
legitimate interests of users and the public interest;
(d) the importance of facilitating the diffusion of information,
knowledge, content, culture, and the arts; and
(e) that establishing and maintaining a transparent intellectual
property system and promoting and maintaining adequate
and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual
property rights provide confidence to right holders and
users.
The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights
should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and
to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual
advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge
and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and
to a balance of rights and obligations.

1. A Party may, in formulating or amending its laws and regulations,
adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition
and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to
its socio-economic and technological development, provided that
such measures are consistent with this Chapter.
2. Appropriate measures, provided that they are consistent with this
Chapter, may be needed to prevent the abuse of intellectual
property rights by right holders or the resort to practices which
unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international
transfer of technology. 2
3. Further to paragraph 2, the Parties recognise the need to foster
competition.
Article 11.5: Obligations
Each Party shall give effect to the provisions of this Chapter. A Party
may, but shall not be obliged to, implement in its law more extensive

For the purposes of the application of this Article, the Parties agree that the fact that
this Chapter provides for more extensive protection of intellectual property than is
required by the TRIPS Agreement does not mean there is an inconsistency within the
meaning of this Article and paragraph 2 of Article 20.2 (Relation to Other Agreements).

does not contravene this Chapter. Each Party shall be free to determine
the appropriate method of implementing this Chapter within its own legal
system and practice.

Each Party shall be free to establish its own regime for exhaustion of
intellectual property rights.

treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own
nationals with regard to the protection 4 of intellectual property,
subject to the exceptions provided in the TRIPS Agreement and
in the multilateral agreements administered by the World
Intellectual Property Organization (hereinafter referred to as
“WIPO” in this Chapter), to which that Party is party.
2. A Party may avail itself of the exceptions referred to in paragraph
1 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including
requiring a national of another Party to designate an address for
service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in its
territory, only where such exceptions are:
3
For the purposes of this paragraph, a “national” of a Party shall include, in respect of
the relevant right, any person as defined in subparagraph (t) of Article 1.2 (General
Definitions) of that Party that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection provided
for in the agreements listed in Article 11.9 (Multilateral Agreements) and the TRIPS
Agreement.
4
For the purposes of this paragraph, “protection” includes matters affecting the
availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement of intellectual property
rights as well as matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically
covered by this Chapter.
Further, for the purposes of this paragraph, “protection” also includes the provisions
concerning:

provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices
of WIPO relating to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual
property rights.
Article 11.8: The TRIPS Agreement and Public Health
1.
The Parties reaffirm the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS
Agreement and Public Health adopted on 14 November 2001. In
particular, the Parties have reached the following understandings
regarding this Chapter:

in respect of which the trademark is registered, where such use would
result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical
sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be
presumed. The rights described in this Article shall not prejudice any
existing prior rights, nor shall they affect the possibility of a Party making
rights available on the basis of use.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, “administrative decisions” include quasi-
judicial decisions.
11-13Article 11.24: Exceptions

knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in
infringing activity.
47
A Party may comply with the obligations under this Subsection to provide civil judicial
procedures concerning the enforcement of geographical indications in accordance with
footnote 4 of Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement.

procedures under those Subsections; and
(b) “pirated copyright goods” means any goods that are copies made
without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorised by the
right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or
indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have
constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the
law of the Party providing procedures under those Subsections.

obligations are temporary measures available in the event that
the Responding Party does not comply with the obligation under
paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final Report)
within the reasonable period of time.
However, neither
compensation nor the suspension of concessions or other
obligations is preferred to compliance with the obligation under
paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final Report).
Compensation is voluntary and, if granted, shall be consistent
with this Agreement.
2. Where any of the following circumstances exists:
(a)
the Responding Party has notified the Complaining Party
that it does not intend to comply with the obligation under
19-21paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final
Report); or
(b) the Responding Party fails to notify the Complaining Party
in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 19.15

in accordance with paragraph 7 of Article 19.15
(Implementation of the Final Report) by the expiry of the

under paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the
Final Report) in accordance with Article 19.16 (Compliance
Review),
the Responding Party shall, on request of the Complaining Party,
enter into negotiations with a view to developing mutually
acceptable compensation.

If the Parties to the dispute have:
(a) been unable to agree on compensation within 30 days after
the date of the receipt of the request made pursuant to
paragraph 2; or
(b) agreed on compensation but the Responding Party has
failed to observe the terms and conditions of that
agreement,
the Complaining Party may at any time thereafter notify the
Responding Party and the other Parties that it intends to suspend
the application to the Responding Party of concessions or other
obligations equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment,
and shall have the right to begin suspending concessions or other
obligations 30 days after the date of the receipt of the notification.

exercise the right to begin suspending concessions or other
obligations under that paragraph where:
(a) a review is being undertaken pursuant to paragraph 9; or
(b) a mutually agreed solution has been reached.
19-225. A notification made pursuant to paragraph 3 shall specify the level
of the intended suspension of concessions or other obligations
and indicate the relevant sector or sectors in which the
Complaining Party proposes to suspend such concessions or
other obligations.
6. In considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend,
the Complaining Party shall apply the following principles:
(a) the Complaining Party should first seek to suspend
concessions or other obligations in the same sector or
sectors in which the panel has determined that there is
non-conformity with, or failure to carry out an obligation
under this Agreement; and
(b) if the Complaining Party considers that it is not practicable
or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations in
the same sector or sectors, it may suspend concessions or
other obligations in other sectors.
7. The level of the suspension of concessions or other obligations
shall be equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment.
8. If the Responding Party:
(a) objects to the level of suspension proposed; or
(b) considers that it has observed the terms and conditions of
the compensation agreement; or
(c) considers that the principles set out in paragraph 6 have
not been followed,
it may, within 30 days of the date of the receipt of the notification
made pursuant to paragraph 3, request the reconvening of a
panel to examine the matter by way of notification to the
Complaining Party. The Responding Party shall simultaneously
provide a copy of the request to the other Parties.
9.
When a request is made pursuant to paragraph 8, the panel shall
reconvene within 15 days of the date of the request. The
reconvened panel shall provide its determination to the Parties to
the dispute within 45 days of the date of its reconvening.
19-2310. In the event the panel reconvened pursuant to paragraph 9
determines that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the
level of nullification or impairment, it shall determine the
appropriate level of suspension it considers to be of equivalent
effect. In the event the panel determines that the Responding
Party has observed the terms and conditions of the compensation
agreement, the Complaining Party shall not suspend concessions
or other obligations referred to in paragraph 3. In the event the
panel determines that the Complaining Party has not followed the
principles set out in paragraph 6, the Complaining Party shall
apply them consistently with that paragraph.
11. The Complaining Party may suspend concessions or other
obligations only in a manner consistent with the panel’s
determination referred to in paragraph 10.
12. The suspension of concessions or other obligations shall be
temporary and shall only be applied until such time as the
obligation under paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of
the Final Report) has been complied with or a mutually agreed
solution has been reached.
13. Where:
(a) the right to suspend concessions or other obligations has
been exercised by the Complaining Party under this Article;
(b) the Responding Party has made a notification pursuant to
paragraph 7 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final
Report) that it has complied with the obligation under
paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final
Report); and
(c) the Parties to the dispute disagree on the existence or
consistency with this Agreement of any measure taken to
comply with the obligation under paragraph 1 of Article
19.15 (Implementation of the Final Report),
any Party to the dispute may request the reconvening of a panel
to examine the matter by way of notification to the other Party to
the dispute. The requesting Party shall simultaneously provide a
copy of the request to the other Parties. 5

Where a panel is reconvened pursuant to this paragraph, it may also, upon request,
determine whether the level of any suspension of concessions or other obligations is
19-2414. Where the panel reconvenes pursuant to paragraph 13,
paragraphs 3 through 6 of Article 19.16 (Compliance Review)
shall apply mutatis mutandis.
15. If the panel reconvened pursuant to paragraph 13 determines that
the Responding Party has complied with the obligation under
paragraph 1 of Article 19.15 (Implementation of the Final Report),
the Complaining Party shall promptly terminate the suspension of
concessions or other obligations.
Article 19.18: Special and Differential Treatment Involving Least
Developed Country Parties
1. At all stages of the determination of the causes of a dispute and
of dispute settlement procedures involving a Least Developed
Country Party, particular consideration shall be given to the
special situation of Least Developed Country Parties. In this
regard, Parties shall exercise due restraint in raising matters
under these procedures involving a Least Developed Country
Party. If nullification or impairment is found to result from a
measure taken by a Least Developed Country Party, a
Complaining Party shall exercise due restraint regarding matters
covered under Article 19.17 (Compensation and Suspension of
Concessions or Other Obligations) or other obligations pursuant
to these procedures.
2. Where any Party to the dispute is a Least Developed Country
Party, the panel’s report shall explicitly indicate the form in which
account has been taken of relevant provisions on special and
differential treatment for a Least Developed Country Party that
form part of this Agreement which have been raised by that Party
in the course of the dispute settlement procedures.
