## Headnotes to the Annex

1. Pursuant to Article 3.2 (Originating Goods), this Annex sets out the conditions required for a good to be treated as an originating good.

2. For greater certainty, the origin criteria of “wholly obtained or produced in a Party” and “produced in a Party exclusively from
originating materials from one or more of the Parties”, as provided in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods),
apply to all tariff lines.

3. For the purposes of interpreting the Product-Specific Rules set out in this Annex:
(a) Section means a section of the Harmonized System;
(b) Chapter means the first two digits of the tariff classification
number under the Harmonized System;
(c) heading means the first four digits of the tariff classification
number under the Harmonized System; and
(d) subheading means the first six digits of the tariff
classification number under the Harmonized System.
4. Where a good is subject to alternative Product-Specific Rules, the
rule will be considered to be met if the good satisfies one of the
alternative Product-Specific Rules.
5. A requirement of a change in tariff classification (hereinafter
referred to as “CTC” in this Annex) applies only to non-originating
materials.

6. Where the CTC rule expressly excludes a change from other tariff classifications, the exclusion applies only to non-originating
materials.

7. For the purposes of this Annex:

(a) RVC40 means that the good must have a regional value
content (hereinafter referred to as “RVC” in this Annex) of
no less than 40 per cent as calculated under Article 3.5
(Calculation of Regional Value Content);
(b) CC means that all non-originating materials used in the
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the two-
digit level of the Harmonized System;
(c) CTH means that all non-originating materials used in the
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the four-
digit level of the Harmonized System;
(d) CTSH means that all non-originating materials used in the
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the six-
digit level of the Harmonized System;
(e) WO means wholly obtained or produced in a Party as
provided in Article 3.3 (Goods Wholly Obtained or
Produced). For greater certainty, where the rule for a good
is WO, the good can still meet the requirements to be
treated as an originating good by being produced in a Party
exclusively from originating materials from one or more of
the Parties in accordance with subparagraph (b) of Article
3.2 (Originating Goods); and
(f) CR means the chemical reaction rule. Any good that is a
product of a chemical reaction shall be considered to be an
originating good if the chemical reaction occurred in a
Party. A “chemical reaction” is a process, including a
biochemical process, which results in a molecule with a
new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by
forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial
arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following are not
considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of
this definition:
(i) dissolving in water or other solvents;
(ii) the elimination of solvents including solvent water;
or
(iii) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation.
Where a Product-Specific Rule provides a choice of rules from an
RVC-based rule of origin, a CTC-based rule of origin, a specific
3A-2manufacturing or processing operation, or a combination of any
of these, each Party shall permit the exporter of a good to decide
which rule to use in determining whether the good qualifies as an
originating good.

This Annex is based on the 2012 Edition of the Harmonized
System, which entered into force on 1 January 2012 (hereinafter
