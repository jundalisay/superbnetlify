## Article 65

1. The Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body
may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a
request.
2. Questions upon which the advisory opinion of the Court is asked shall be laid before the Court
by means of a written request containing an exact statement of the question upon which an opinion
is required, and accompanied by all documents likely to throw light upon the question.


## Article 66

1. The Registrar shall forthwith give notice of the request for an advisory opinion to all states
entitled to appear before the Court.

2. The Registrar shall also, by means of a special and direct communication, notify any state
entitled to appear before the Court or international organization considered by the Court, or, should
it not be sitting, by the President, as likely to be able to furnish information on the question, that the Court will be prepared to receive, within a time limit to be fixed by the President, written
statements, or to hear, at a public sitting to be held for the purpose, oral statements relating to the question.

3. Should any such state entitled to appear before the Court have failed to receive the special
communication referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, such state may express a desire to submit
a written statement or to be heard; and the Court will decide.

4. States and organizations having presented written or oral statements or both shall be per-
mitted to comment on the statements made brother states or organizations in the form, to the
extent, and within the time limits which the Court, or, should it not be sitting, the President, shall decide in each particular case. 

Accordingly, the Registrar shall in due time communicate any such written statements to states and organizations having submitted similar statements.


## Article 67

The Court shall deliver its advisory opinions in open court, notice having been given to the Secretary-General and to the representatives of Members of the United Nations, of other states and of international organizations immediately concerned.

## Article 68

In the exercise of its advisory functions the Court shall further be guided by the provisions of
the present Statute which apply in contentious cases to the extent to which it recognizes them to be
applicable.
