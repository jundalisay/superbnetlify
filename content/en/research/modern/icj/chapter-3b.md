### Article 53

1. Whenever one of the parties does not appear before the Court, or fails to defend its case, the
other party may call upon the Court to decide in favor of its claim.

2. The Court must, before doing so, satisfy itself, not only that it has jurisdiction in accordance
with Articles 36 and 37, but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law.

2. In the event of an equality of votes, the President or the judge who acts in his place shall have
a casting vote.

their presentation of the case, the President shall declare the hearing closed.
2. The Court shall withdraw to consider the judgment.
3. The deliberations of the Court shall take place in private and remain secret.


### Article 56

1. The judgment shall state the reasons on which it is based.
2. It shall contain the names of the judges who have taken part in the decision.

If the judgment does not represent in whole or in part the unanimous opinion of the judges, any
judge shall be entitled to deliver a separate opinion.

The judgment shall be signed by the President and by the Registrar. It shall be read in open court,
due notice having heen given to the agents.


### Article 59

The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that

The judgment is final and without appeal. In the event of dispute as to the meaning or scope of
the judgment, the Court shall construe it upon the request of any party.

vene in the proceedings; but if it uses this right,
the construction given by the judgment will be
equally binding upon it.
Article 64


### Article 61

1. An application for revision of a judgment may be made only when it is based upon the dis-
covery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment
was given, unknown to the Court and also to the party claiming revision, always provided that such
ignorance was not due to negligence. 

2. The proceedings for revision shall be opened
by a judgment of the Court expressly recording the
existence of the new fact, recognizing that it has
such a character as to lay the case open to revision,
and declaring the application admissible on this
ground.

3. The Court may require previous compliance with the terms of the judgment before it admits
proceedings in revision.

4. The application for revision must be made at latest within six months of the discovery of the
new fact.

after the lapse of ten years from the date of the
judgment.

2. It shall be for the Court to decide upon this request.


### Article 63

1. Whenever the construction of a convention to which states other than those concerned in the case are parties is in question, the Registrar shall notify all such states forthwith.


### Article 64

Unless otherwise decided by the Court, each party shall bear its own costs.
