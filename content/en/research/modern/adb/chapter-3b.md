### Article 14 OPERATING PRINCIPLES

Bank operations will follow these principles: 

1. These are for financing of specific projects, including those forming part of a national, sub-regional or regional development programme. 

They may, however, include loans to, or guarantees of loans made to, national development banks or other suitable entities, in order that the latter may finance specific development projects whose individual financing requirements are not, in the opinion of the Bank, large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank;

2. In selecting suitable projects, the Bank shall always be guided by the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii) of Article 2 of this Agreement;

3. The Bank shall not finance any undertaking in the territory of a member if that member objects to such financing;

4. Before a loan is granted, the applicant shall have submitted an adequate loan proposal and the President of the Bank shall have presented to the Board of Directors a written report regarding the proposal, together with his recommendations, on the basis of a staff study

5. In considering an application for a loan or guarantee, the Bank shall pay due regard to the ability of the borrower to obtain financing or facilities elsewhere on terms and conditions that the Bank considers reasonable for the recipient, taking into account all pertinent factors

6. In making or guaranteeing a loan, the Bank shall pay due regard to the prospects that the borrower and its guarantor, if any, will be in a position to meet their obligations under the loan contract

7. In making or guaranteeing a loan, the rate of interest, other charges and the schedule for repayment of principal shall be such: as are, in the opinion of the Bank, appropriate for the loan concerned

8. In guaranteeing a loan made by other investors, or in underwriting the sale of securities,
the Bank shall receive suitable compensation for its risk;

9. The proceeds of any loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the ordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds established by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1 (i) of Article 19, shall be used only for procurement in member countries of goods and services produced in member countries, except in any case in which the Board of Directors by a vote of the Directors representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a non-member country or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances making such procurement appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of financing has been provided to the Bank; 

10. In the case of a direct loan made by the Bank, the borrower shall be permitted by the Bank to draw its funds only to meet expenditures in connection with the project as they are actually incurred;

11. The Bank shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan made,
guaranteed or participated in by the Bank are used only for the purposes for which the
loan was granted and with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency;

12. The Bank shall pay due regard to the desirability of avoiding a disproportionate amount
of its resources being used for the benefit of any member;(xiii) The Bank shall seek to maintain reasonable diversification in its investments in equity capital; it shall not assume responsibility for managing any entity or enterprise in which it has an investment, except where necessary to safeguard its investments; and (xiv) The Bank shall be guided by sound banking principles in its operations.


### Article 15 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR DIRECT LOANS AND GUARANTEES

1. In the case of direct loans made or participated in or loans guaranteed by the Bank, the
contract shall establish, in conformity with the operating principles set forth in Article 14 of this Agreement and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions for the loan or the guarantee
concerned, including those relating to payment of principal, interest and other charges, maturities, and dates
of payment in respect of the loan, or the fees and other charges in respect of the guarantee, respectively. In
particular, the contract shall provide that, subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, all payments to the Bank
under the contract shall be made in the currency loaned, unless, in the case of a direct loan made or a loan
guaranteed as part of special operations with funds provided under paragraph 1 (ii) of Article 19, the rules
and regulations of the Bank provide otherwise. Guarantees by the Bank shall also provide that the Bank
may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and the guarantor, if any,
the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other
obligations guaranteed.

2.
Where the recipient of loans or guarantees of loans is not itself a member, the Bank may,
when it deems it advisable, require that the member in whose territory the project concerned is to be carried
out, or a public agency or any instrumentality of that member acceptable to the Bank, guarantee the
repayment of the principal and the payment of interest and other charges on the loan in accordance with the
terms thereof.
3.
The loan or guarantee contract shall expressly state the currency in which all payments to
the Bank thereunder shall be made. At the option of the borrower, however, such payments may always be
made in gold or convertible currency.

participated in as part of its ordinary operations.

2. In guaranteeing a loan as part of its ordinary operations, the Bank shall charge a
guarantee fee, at a rate determined by the Board of Directors, payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding.

3. Other charges of the Bank in its ordinary operations and any commission, fees or other
charges in its special operations shall be determined by the Board of Directors.


### Article 17=  SPECIAL RESERVE

The amount of commissions and guarantee fees received by the Bank pursuant to Article 16 of this
Agreement shall be set aside as a special reserve which shall be kept for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Article 18 of this Agreement. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form as the Board of Directors may decide.


### Article 18=  METHODS OF MEETING LIABILITIES OF THE BANK

1. In cases of default on loans made, participated in or guaranteed by the Bank in its

surplus and capital available to the Bank.

3. Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or
amortization on borrowings of the Bank in its ordinary operations, or to meet its liabilities with respect to
similar payments in respect of loans guaranteed by it, chargeable to its ordinary capital resources, the Bank
may call an appropriate amount of the uncalled subscribed callable capital in accordance with paragraphs 6
and 7 of Article 6 of this Agreement;

4. In cases of default in respect of a loan made from borrowed funds or guaranteed by the
Bank as part of its ordinary operations, the Bank may, if it believes that the default may be of long duration,
call an additional amount of such callable capital not to exceed in any one (1) year one (1) per cent of the
total subscriptions of the members to such capital, for the following purposes=

the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in
default; and
(ii) To repurchase, or otherwise discharge, the Bank's liability on all or part of its own
outstanding borrowing.

5. If the Bank's subscribed callable capital stock shall be entirely called pursuant to
paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the Bank may, if necessary for the purposes specified in paragraph 3 of
