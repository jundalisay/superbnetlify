## Article 41: WITHDRAWAL

1. Any member may withdraw from the Bank at any time by delivering a notice in writing to the Bank at its principal office.
2. Withdrawal by a member shall become effective, and its membership shall cease, on the date specified in its notice but in no event less than six (6) months after the date that notice has been received by the Bank. However, at any time before the withdrawal becomes finally effective, the member may notify the Bank in writing of the cancellation of its notice of intention to withdraw.
3. A withdrawing member shall remain liable for all direct and contingent obligations to the Bank to which it was subject at the date of delivery of the withdrawal notice. If the withdrawal becomes finally effective, the member shall not incur any liability for obligations resulting from operations of the Bank effected after the date on which the withdrawal notice was received by the Bank.


## Article 42: SUSPENSION OF MEMBERSHIP

1. If a member fails to fulfill any of its obligation to the Bank, the Board of Governors may
suspend such member by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of Governors, representing not less than 3/4 of the total voting power of the members.
2. The member so suspended shall automatically cease to be a member of the Bank one (1)
year from the date of its suspension unless the Board of Governors, during the one-year period, decides by the same majority necessary for suspension to restore the member to good standing.
3. While under suspension, a member shall not be entitled to exercise any rights under this
Agreement, except the right of withdrawal, but shall remain subject to all its obligations.


## Article 43=  SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS

1. After the date on which a country ceases to be a member, it shall remain liable for its
direct obligations to the Bank and for its contingent liabilities to the Bank so long as any part of the loans or guarantees contracted before it ceased to be a member is outstanding, but it shall not incur liabilities with respect to loans and guarantees entered into thereafter by the Bank nor share either in the income or the expenses of the Bank.

2. At the time a country ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of
such country's shares by the Bank as a part of the settlement of accounts with such country in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article. For this purpose, the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member.

3. The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this Article shall be governed by
the following conditions= 

- a. Any amount due to the country concerned for its shares shall be withheld so long as that country, its central bank or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No amount shall be withheld on account of the contingent liability of the country for future calls on its subscription for shares in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 of this Agreement. In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six (6) months after the date on which the country ceases to be a member.


- b. Payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon surrender of the corresponding stock certificates by the country concerned, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article exceeds the aggregate amount of liabilities, on loans and guarantees referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, until the former member has received the full repurchase price.

- c. Payments shall be made in such available currencies as the Bank determines, taking into account its financial position.

- d. If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees or loans which were outstanding on the date when a country ceased to be a member and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserve provided against losses on that date, the country concerned shall repay, upon demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. 

In addition, the former member shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions in accordance with paragraph 5 to Article 6 of this Agreement, to the same extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital
had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was
determined.

4. If the Bank terminates its operations pursuant to Article 45 of this Agreement within six
(6) months of the date upon which any country ceases to be a member, all rights of the country concerned shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 45 to 47 of this Agreement. Such country shall be considered as still a member for purposes of such Articles but shall have no voting rights.


## Article 44: TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS

In an emergency, the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend operations in respect of new loans and guarantees, pending an opportunity for further consideration and action by the Board of Governors.

## Article 45: TERMINATION OF OPERATIONS

1. The Bank may terminate its operations by a resolution of the Board of Governors
approved by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of Governors, representing not less than 3/4 of the total voting power of the members.

2. After such termination, the Bank shall forthwith cease all activities, except those incident
to the orderly realization, conservation and preservation of its assets and settlement of its obligations.

## Article 46: LIABILITY OF MEMBERS AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS

1. In the event of termination of the operation of the Bank, the liability of all members for uncalled subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank and in respect of the depreciation of their currencies shall continue until all claims of creditors, including all contingent claims shall have been discharged.
2. All creditors holding direct claims shall first be paid out of the assets of the Bank and then out of payments to the Bank or unpaid or callable subscriptions. Before making any payments to creditors holding direct claims, the Board of Directors shall make such arrangements as are necessary, in its judgment, to ensure a pro rata distribution among holders of direct and contingent claims.


### Article 47 DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS

1. No distribution of assets shall be made to members on account of their subscriptions to
the capital stock of the Bank until all liabilities to creditors have been discharged or provided for.

Moreover, such distribution must be approved by the Board of Governors by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of Governors, representing not less than three-fourths of the total voting power of the members.

2. Any distribution of the assets of the Bank to the members shall be in proportion to the
capital stock held by each member and shall be effected at such times and under such conditions as the Bank shall deem fair and equitable. The shares of assets distributed need not be uniform as to type of asset.

No member shall be entitled to receive its share in such a distribution of assets until it has settled all of its
obligations to the Bank.

3. Any member receiving assets distributed pursuant to this Article shall enjoy the same rights with respect to such assets as the Bank enjoyed prior to their distribution.
