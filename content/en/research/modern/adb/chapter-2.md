## Article 4: AUTHORIZED CAPITAL

1. The Bank's authorized capital stock shall be $l,000,000,000 from 31 January 1966. 

This will be divided into 100,000 shares having a par value of $10,000 each, which shall be available for subscription only by members in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of this Agreement.

2. The original authorized capital stock shall be divided into paid-in shares and callable
shares. Shares having an aggregate par value of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) shall be paid-
in shares, and shares having an aggregate par value of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) shall be
callable shares.

3. The authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased by the Board of Governors, at
such time and under such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable, by a vote of two-thirds of the
total number of Governors, representing not less than three-fourths of the total voting power of the
members.


## Article 5: SUBSCRIPTION OF SHARES

1. Each member shall subscribe to shares of the capital stock of the Bank. Each subscription
to the original authorized capital stock shall be for paid-in shares and callable shares in equal parts. The
initial number of shares to be subscribed by countries which become members in accordance with Article
64 of this Agreement shall be that set forth in Annex A hereof. The initial number of shares to be
subscribed by countries which are admitted to membership in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3 of
this Agreement shall be determined by the Board of Governors; provided, however, that no such
subscription shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock
held by regional members below sixty (60) per cent of the total subscribed capital stock.

2. The Board of Governors shall at intervals of not less than five (5) years review the capital
stock of the Bank. In case of an increase in the authorized capital stock, each member shall have a
reasonable opportunity to subscribe, under such terms and conditions as the Board of Governors shall
determine, to a proportion of the increase of stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock theretofore
subscribed bears to the total subscribed capital stock immediately prior to such increase; provided,
however, that the foregoing provision shall not apply in respect of any increase or portion of an increase in
the authorized capital stock intended solely to give effect to determinations of the Board of Governors
under paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article. No member shall be obligated to subscribe to any part of an
increase of capital stock.

3.
The Board of Governors may, at the request of a member, increase the subscription of
such member on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine; provided, however, that no such
increase in the subscription of any member shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the
percentage of capital stock held by regional members below sixty (60) per cent of the total subscribedcapital stock. The Board of Governors shall pay special regard to the request of any regional member
having less than six (6) per cent of the subscribed capital stock to increase its proportionate share thereof.

4.
Shares of stock initially subscribed by members shall be issued at par. Other shares shall
be issued at par unless the Board of Governors by a vote of a majority of the total number of Governors,
representing a majority of the total voting power of the members, decides in special circumstances to issue
them on other terms.
5.
Shares of stock shall not be pledged or encumbered in any manner whatsoever, and they
shall not be transferable except to the Bank in accordance with Chapter VII of this Agreement.
6. The liability of the members on shares shall be limited to the unpaid portion of their issue
7. No member shall be liable, by reason of its membership, for obligations of the Bank.
