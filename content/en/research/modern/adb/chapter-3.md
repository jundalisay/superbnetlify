markets or borrowed or otherwise acquired by the Bank for inclusion in its ordinary
capital resources;

majority of the total voting power of the members, shall have determined that the Bank is
in a position to commence such type of operations; or
(iv) by guaranteeing, whether as primary or secondary obligor, in whole or in part, loans for

unimpaired paid-in capital stock of the Bank actually paid up at any given time together with the reserves
and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources, exclusive of .the special reserve provided for in Article 17 of this Agreement.

4. The amount of any equity investment shall not exceed such percentage of the equity capital of the entity or enterprise concerned as the Board of Directors shall in each specific case determine

### Article 13=  PROVISION OF CURRENCIES FOR DIRECT LOANS

In making direct loans or participating in them, the Bank may provide financing in any of the
following ways=

by furnishing the borrower with currencies other than the currency of the member in
whose territory the project concerned is to be carried out (the latter currency hereinafter to be called "local
currency"), which are necessary to meet the foreign exchange costs of such project; or
(ii)
by providing financing to meet local expenditures on the project concerned, where it can
do so by supplying local currency without selling any of its holdings in gold or convertible currencies. In
special cases when, in the opinion of the Bank, the project causes or is likely to cause undue loss or strain
on the balance of payments of the member in whose territory the project is to be carried out, the financing
granted by the Bank to meet local expenditures may be provided in currencies other than that of such
member; in such cases, the amount of the financing granted by the Bank for this purpose shall not exceed a
reasonable portion of the total local expenditure incurred by the borrower.
