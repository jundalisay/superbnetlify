1-6. By the Mount and the seething sea, in the frequented House with the elevated roof, in a Book inscribed with a published scroll. 

7-8. The punishment of your Lord is coming.There is nothing to avert it. 

{{< s v="9" >}}  On the Day when the heaven sways in agitation.
{{< s v="10" >}}  And the mountains go into motion.{{< s v="11" >}}  Woe on that Day to the deniers.

12. Those who play with speculation.
13. The Day when they are shoved into the Fire
of Hell forcefully.

14. “This 15. Is

in it. Whether you are patient, or im-
patient, it is the same for you. You are only
being repaid for what you used to do.”
17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and
bliss.
18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them,
and their Lord has spared them the suffering
of Hell.
19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to
do.
20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and We
will couple them with gorgeous spouses.
21. Those who believed, and their offspring
followed them in faith—We will unite them
with their offspring, and We will not deprive
them of any of their works. Every person is
hostage to what he has earned.
22. And We will supply them with fruit, and
meat; such as they desire.
23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein
is neither harm, nor sin.
24. Serving them will be youths like hidden
pearls.

20153. THE STAR (an-Najm)
And they will approach one another, in-
quiring.
26. They will say, “Before this, we were fearful
for our families.
27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag-
ony of the Fiery Winds.
28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is
the Good, the Compassionate.”
29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you
are neither a soothsayer, nor a madman.
30. Or do they say, “A poet—we await for him
a calamity of time”?
31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with
you.”
32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to
this? Or are they aggressive people?
33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather,
they do not believe.
34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if
they are truthful.
35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or
are they the creators?
36. Or did they create the heavens and the
earth? In fact, they are not certain.
37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your
Lord? Or are they the controllers?
38. Or do they have a stairway by means of
which they listen? Then let their listener pro-
duce a clear proof.
39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the
sons?
40. Or do you demand a payment from them,
and they are burdened by debt?
41. Or do they know the future, and they are
writing it down?
42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The
conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.
43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah
transcends what they associate.
44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky
falling down, they would say, “A mass of
clouds.”
25.
45. So
leave them until they meet their Day in
which they will be stunned.
46. The Day when their ploys will avail them
nothing; and they will not be helped.
47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish-
ment besides that; but most of them do not
know.
48. So patiently await the decision of your
Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro-
claim the praises of your Lord when you
arise.

49. And glorify Him during the night, and at
the receding of the stars.
