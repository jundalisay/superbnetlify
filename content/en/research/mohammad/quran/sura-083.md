{{< s v="1-3" >}}
The defrauders are those who take a full measure from people. 
- But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat.
- Woe to them!

{{< s v="7" >}} The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen, a numerical book.

When our Our revelations are recited to the sinful aggressor, he says, “Legends of the ancients.”
- Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to earn.

{{< s v="15" >}} On that Day:
- they will roast in Hell.
- It will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”

{{< s v="18" >}} The record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen, a numerical book.

32. And if they saw them, they would say, “These people are lost.”
33. Yet they were not sent as guardians over them.
34. But on that Day, those who believed will laugh at the unbelievers.
35. On luxurious furnishings, looking on. 
36. Have the unbelievers been repaid for what they used to do?
