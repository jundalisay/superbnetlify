{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}} 
Moses, who is your Lord?
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="50" >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}} 
Our Lord is He who gave everything its existence, then guided it.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="51" >}}

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}} 
What about the first generations?
{{< /r >}} 

{{< s v="52-56" >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}} 
Knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does He forget.

He who made the earth a habitat for you; and traced in it routes for you; and sent down water from the sky, with which We produce pairs of diverse plants.

Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are signs for those with understanding.

From it We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you out another time.

We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused.

57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?

58. We will produce for you magic like it; so make an appointment between us and you, which we will not miss—neither us, nor you—in a central place.”

59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of the festival, so let the people be gathered together at mid-morning.”

50. Pharaoh turned away, put together his plan, and then came back.

61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy
you with a punishment. He who invents lies will fail.”

62. They disagreed among themselves over their affair, and conferred secretly.

63. They said, “These two are magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their
magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of life.

64. So settle your plan, and come as one front. Today, whoever gains the upper hand will succeed.”

65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw.”

66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of their magic, to be crawling swiftly.

67. So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up-
permost.

69. Now throw down what is in your right hand—it will swallow what they have crafted. What they have crafted is only a magician’s trickery. But the magician will not succeed, no matter what he does.”

70. And the magicians fell down prostrate. They said, “We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”

71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be your
chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides,
and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees. 

Then you will know which of us is more severe in punishment, and more lasting.”

72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the proofs that have come to us, and Him who created us. So issue whatever judgment you wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly life.

73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins, and the magic you have compelled us to practice. Allah is Better, and more Lasting.”

74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.

75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, having worked righteousness—these will have the highest ranks.

76. The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is the reward for him who purifies himself. 

77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night with My servants, and strike for them a dry path across the sea, not fearing being over-
taken, nor worrying.”

78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but the sea overwhelmed them, and completely
engulfed them.
79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not
guide them.

80. O Jews! We have delivered you from your enemy, and promised you by the right side of the Mount, and sent down to
you manna and quails. 

81. Eat of the good things We have provided for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest
My wrath descends upon you. He upon whom My wrath descends has fallen.
82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re-
pents, believes, acts righteously, and then re-
mains guided.

83. “And what made you rush ahead of your people, O Moses?”

84. He said, “They are following in my footsteps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that
you may be pleased.”

85. He said, “We have tested your people in your absence, and the Samarian misled them.”

86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and disappointed. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise?
Was the time too long for you? Or did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon
you, so you broke your promise to me?”

87. They said, “We did not break our promise to you by our choice, but we were made to
carry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we cast them in. That was what the Samarian
suggested.”

88. So he produced for them a calf—a mere body which lowed. And they said, “This is
your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten.”

89. Did they not see that it cannot return a word to them, and has no power to harm
them or benefit them?

90. Aaron had said to them before, “O my people, you are being tested by this. And your Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey my command.”

91. They said, “We will not give up our devotion to it, until Moses returns to us.”

92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray.
93. From following me? Did you disobey my command?”

94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or my head. I feared you
would say, `You have caused division among the Jews, and did not regard my word.'“

95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Samarian?”

96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I grasped a handful from the Messenger’s
traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul prompted me.”

97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in this life is to say, ‘No contact.’ You have an appointment that you will not miss. Now look at your god that you remained devoted to—we will burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, as powder.”

98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides whom there is no other god. He comprehends everything in knowledge.

Thus We narrate to you reports of times gone by; and We have given you a message from Our Presence.
