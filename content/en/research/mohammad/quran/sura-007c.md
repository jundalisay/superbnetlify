{{< s v="85-86" >}} We sent to the people of Madyan their brother Shuaib. He said:

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
“O my people, worship Allah. Give full measure and weight. Do not:
- cheat people out of their rights
- corrupt the land once it has been set right. 
- lurk on every path, making threats and turning away from Allah's path those who believe in Him, seeking to distort it.

Remember how you were few, and how He made you numerous. 

So note the consequences for the corrupters.

Some of you believed in my message. Some do not believe. Be patient until Allah judges between us
{{< /l >}}


88. The arrogant elite among his people replid: 

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town, along with those who believe with you, unless you return to our religion.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
Even if we are unwilling? We would be fabricating falsehood against Allah if we return to your religion after Allah has saved us from it.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- In Allah we place our trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in
truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.” -->

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If you follow Shuaib, you will be losers.”
{{< /r >}}

91. Then the quake struck them and they became lifeless bodies in their homes.

92. Those who rejected Shuaib are the losers, as if they never prospered therein.

93. So Shuaib turned away from them and said:

“O my people, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so why should I grieve over a disbelieving people?”

94. We did not send any prophet to any town but We afflicted its people with misery and adversity, so that they may humble themselves.

95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of hardship. Until they increased in number, and said, “Adversity and prosperity has touched our ancestors.” Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.

96. Had the people of the towns believed and turned righteous, We would have opened for
them the blessings of the heaven and the earth; but they rejected the truth, so We
seized them by what they were doing.


97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them by night, while they sleep?

98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them by day, while they play?

99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None feel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing people.

100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the land after its inhabitants, that if We willed,

We could strike them for their sins? 

And seal up their hearts, so that they would not hear?

101. These towns—We narrate to you some of their tales. Their messengers came to them
with the clear signs, but they would not believe in what they had rejected previously.

Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.

102. We found most of them untrue to their covenants; We found most of them corrupt.

103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment, but they denounced them. So consider the end of the evildoers.

104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.”
105. “It is only proper that I should not say about Allah anything other than the truth. I
have come to you with clear evidence from
your Lord, so let the Jews go with me.”

106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then
present it, if you are truthful.”

107. So he threw his staff, and it was an apparent serpent.
108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was white to the onlookers.
109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people said, “This is really a skilled magician.”

110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so what do you recommend?”
111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother, and send heralds to the cities.”
112. “And let them bring you every skillful magician.”
113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said, “Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the victors.”

114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my favorites.”
115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or we are the ones to throw.”
He said, “You throw!” And when they threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people,
and intimidated them, and produced a mighty magic.

117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your staff.” And at once, it swallowed what they were faking.

118. So the truth came to pass, and what they were producing came to nothing.
119. There they were defeated, and utterly reduced.

120. And the magicians fell to their knees.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord
of the Worlds.”

122. “The
Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
said, “Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? This is
surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city,
in order to expel its people from it. You will
surely know.”

124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”
125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will return.”
126. “You are taking vengeance on us only because we have believed in the signs of our
Lord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord! Pour out patience upon us, and receive our
souls in submission.”

127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will you let Moses and his people cause trouble in
the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their
women. We have absolute power over them.”

128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Allah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al-
lah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever He wills of His servants, and the future belongs to the righteous.”

129. They said, “We were persecuted before you came to us, and after you came to us.” He
said, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy, and make you successors in the land;
then He will see how you behave.”

123. Pharaoh

And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with barren years, and with shortage of crops,
that they may take heed. 

131. When something good came their way,
they said, “This is ours.” And when some-
thing bad happened to them, they ascribed
the evil omen to Moses and those with him.
In fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of
them do not know.

132. And they said, “No matter what sign you bring us, to bewitch us with, we will not believe in you.”

133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and
the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and
blood—all explicit signs—but they were too
arrogant. They were a sinful people.
134. Whenever a plague befell them, they
would say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for
us, according to the covenant He made with
you. If you lift the plague from us, we will be-
lieve in you, and let the Jews go
with you.”
135. But when We lifted the plague from them,
for a term they were to fulfill, they broke their
promise.

136. So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea—because they re-
jected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.

137. And We made the oppressed people inherit the eastern and western parts of the
land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the Jews
was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And
We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people
had built, and what they had harvested.

138. And We delivered the Jews across the sea. And when they came upon a
people who were devoted to some statues of theirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god, as they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an ignorant people.”

139. “What these people are concerned with is perdition, and their deeds are based on falsehoods.”
140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other
than Allah, when He has favored you over all other people?”
141. Remember how We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst
of sufferings—killing your sons and sparing
your women. In that was a tremendous trial
from your Lord.

142. And We appointed to Moses 30 nights, and completed them with ten; and thus the
time appointed by his Lord was 40 nights.

And Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take my place among my people, and be upright, and do not follow the way of the mischief-
makers.”

143. And when Moses came to Our appointment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said,
“My Lord, allow me to look and see You.” 

He said, “You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see
Me.” But when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and
Moses fell down unconscious. 

Then, when he recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent
to you, and I am the first of the believers.”
144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over
all people for My messages and for My
Words. 

So take what I have given you, and be one of the thankful.”

145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets all kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex-
planation of all things. “Hold fast to them,
and exhort your people to adopt the best of
them. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”
146. I will turn away from My revelations those
who behave proudly on earth without justifi-
cation. Even if they see every sign, they will
not believe in it; and if they see the path of
rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and
if they see the path of error, they will adopt it
for a path. That is because they denied Our
revelations, and paid no attention to them.
147. Those who deny Our revelations and the
meeting of the Hereafter—their deeds will
come to nothing. Will they be repaid except
according to what they used to do?


it upon whomever I will, but My mercy en-
compasses all things. I will specify it for those
who act righteously and practice regular
charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”

157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned
in the Torah and the Gospel in their possession. He directs them to righteousness, and
deters them from evil, and allows for them all good things, and prohibits for them wicked-
ness, and unloads the burdens and the shackles that are upon them. Those who believe in
him, and respect him, and support him, and follow the light that came down with him--these are the successful.

<!-- 158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all—He to whom belongs the king-
dom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and causes death.”

So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His words. -->
