{{< s v="1" >}} Be conscious of your Lord. The quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.

{{< s v="2" >}} On that Day:
- every nursing mother will discard her infant
- every pregnant woman will abort her load
- you will see the people drunk, even though they are not drunk
<!-- —but the punishment of Allah is severe. -->

{{< s v="3" >}} Some person will argue about Allah without knowledge and follow every defiant devil.

{{< s v="4" >}} He will misguide his followers and lead them to the torment of the Blaze.

{{< s v="5" >}} Regarding the Resurrection:
- We created you from dust
- then from a small drop
- then from a clinging clot
- then from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. 
- We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a designated term
- We then bring you out as infants, until you reach your full strength.
- Some of you will pass away
- some of you will be returned to the vilest age, so that he may not know, after having known. 

And you see the earth still; but when We send down water on it, it vibrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of lovely pairs.

{{< s v="6" >}} That is because Allah:
- gives life to the dead
- Capable of everything.

{{< s v="7" >}} The Hour is coming
- Allah will resurrect those in the graves.

{{< s v="8-9" >}} A misguider will lead away people from the path of Allah in contempt. 
<!-- 8. And among the people is he who argues
about Allah without knowledge, or guidance,
or an enlightening scripture. -->
- He will be humiliated in this world
- On Resurrection Day, We will make him taste the agony of burning.

{{< s v="10" >}} That is for what your hands have advanced, and because Allah is not unjust to the servants.

{{< s v="11" >}} Among the people is he who worships Allah on edge. When something good comes his way, he is content with it. But when an ordeal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He loses this world and the next. That is the obvious loss.

{{< s v="12" >}} He invokes, instead of Allah, what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the far straying.

{{< s v="13" >}} He invokes one whose harm is closer than
his benefit. What a miserable master. What a
miserable companion.

{{< s v="14" >}} Allah will admit those who believe and do
righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which
rivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.

{{< s v="15" >}} Whoever thinks that Allah will not help
him in this life and in the Hereafter—let him
turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun-
ning eliminates what enrages him.

{{< s v="16" >}}Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and
Allah guides whomever He wills.


17. Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and
the Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists—Allah will judge between them on the Day of Res-
urrection. Allah is witness to all things.

18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates everyone in the heavens and everyone on
earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and
the animals, and many of the people? 

But many are justly deserving of punishment. Whomever Allah shames, there is none to
honor him. Allah does whatever He wills. 

19. Here are two adversaries feuding regarding
their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be tailored for them, and scalding water will be poured over their
heads. 

20. Melting

21. Their insides and their skins.
they will have maces of iron.
Whenever they try to escape the gloom,
they will be driven back to it: “Taste the suf-
fering of burning.”

23. But Allah will admit those who believe and
do good deeds into Gardens beneath which
rivers flow. They will be decorated therein
with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their
garments therein will be of silk.

24. They were guided to purity of speech. They
were guided to the path of the Most Praised.
25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from
Allah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque—
which We have designated for all mankind
equally, whether residing therein or passing
through—and seek to commit sacrilege
therein—We will make him taste of a painful
punishment.
26. We showed Abraham the location of the
House: “Do not associate anything with Me;
and purify My House for those who circle
around, and those who stand to pray, and
those who kneel and prostrate.”
27. And announce the pilgrimage to human-
ity. They will come to you on foot, and on
every transport. They will come from every
distant point.
28. That they may witness the benefits for
themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah
during the appointed days, for providing
them with the animal livestock. So eat from
it, and feed the unfortunate poor.
29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans-
ing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around
the Ancient House.
30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities of Allah—it is good for him with his Lord. 

All livestock are permitted to you, except what is recited to you. So stay away from the abomination of idols, and stay away from perjury.

31. Being true to Allah, without associating anything with Him. Whoever associates any-
thing with Allah—it is as though he has fallen from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or
is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.

32. So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah—it is from the piety of the hearts.
33. In them are benefits for you until a certain time. Then their place is by the Ancient House.

34. We have appointed a rite for every nation, that they may commemorate Allah’s name
over the livestock He has provided for them.
Your God is One God, so to Him submit, and
announce good news to the humble.

35. Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and those who endure what has
befallen them, and those who perform the prayer and spend from what We have provided for them.
36. We have made the animal offerings emblems of Allah for you. In them is goodness
for you. 

So pronounce Allah’s name upon them as they line up. Then, when they have fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the
contented and the beggar. Thus We have subjected them to you, that you may be thankful.

37. Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever reaches Allah. What reaches Him is the righteousness from you. Thus He subdued them
to you, that you may glorify Allah for guiding you. And give good news to the charitable.
38. Allah defends those who believe. Allah does not love any ungrateful traitor.
39. Permission is given to those who are fought against, and Allah is Able to give them victory.
40. Those who were unjustly evicted from their homes, merely for saying, “Our Lord is Allah.” Were it not that Allah repels people
by means of others: monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques—where the name
of Allah is mentioned much—would have been demolished. Allah supports whoever supports Him. 



41. Those who, when We empower them in the land, observe the prayer, and give regular
charity, and command what is right, and forbid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the outcome of events.

42. If they deny you—before them the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.
43. And the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot.
44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses was denied. Then I reprieved those who disbelieved, but then I seized them. So how was My rejection?

45. How many a town have We destroyed while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins;
with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.

46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and had minds to reason with, or ears to listen
with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is
the hearts, within the chests, that go blind.

47. And they ask you to hasten the punishment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A
day with your Lord is like a thousand years of
your count.

48. How many a town have I reprieved, although it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me
is the destination.

49. Say, “O people, I am only a plain warner toyou.”
50. Those who believe and work righteousness—for them is forgiveness and a generous
provision.

51. But those who strive against Our revela-
tions—these are the inmates of Hell.
52. We never sent a messenger before you, or
a prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in-
terfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what
Satan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela-
tions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.
53. In order to make Satan’s suggestions a trial
for those whose hearts are diseased, and those
whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers
are in profound discord.
And so that those endowed with
knowledge may know that it is the truth from
your Lord, and so believe in it, and their
hearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be-
lieve to a straight path.
55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be
hesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon
them suddenly, or there comes to them the
torment of a desolate Day.
56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah;
He will judge between them. Those who be-
lieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar-
dens of Bliss.
57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our
revelations—these will have a humiliating
punishment.
58. Those who emigrate in Allah’s cause, then
get killed, or die, Allah will provide them with
fine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.
59. He will admit them an admittance that will
please them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.
60. That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to
the affliction he was made to suffer, and then
he is wronged again, Allah will definitely as-
sist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
61. That is because Allah merges the night into
the day, and He merges the day into the night,
and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and
what they invoke besides Him is vanity, and
because Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.
63. Do you not see that Allah sends down wa-
ter from the sky, and the land becomes green?
Allah is Kind and Aware.
64. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the
Praised.
65. Do you not see that Allah made everything
on earth subservient to you? How the ships
sail at sea by His command? That He holds
up the sky lest it falls on earth—except by His
permission?



66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes
you die, then revives you. The human being
is unappreciative.
67. For every congregation We have appointed
acts of devotion, which they observe. So do
not let them dispute with you in this matter.
And invite to your Lord; you are upon a
straight guidance.
68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is
fully aware of what you do.”
69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection regarding what you disagree about.

70. Do you not know that Allah knows every-
thing in the heavens and the earth? This is in
a book. That is easy for Allah.
71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for
which He sent down no warrant, and what
they have no knowledge of. There is no savior
for the transgressors.

72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, you will recognize disgust on the faces
of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault those who recite to them Our Verses. Say,
“Shall I inform you of something worse than that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those
who disbelieve. And what a wretched outcome!”

73. O people! Listen to a parable: Those you invoke besides Allah will never create a fly, even if they banded together for that purpose. And if the fly steals anything from them, they cannot recover it from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pursued.

74. They do not value Allah as He should be valued. 

75. Allah chooses messengers from among:
- the angels, and
- the people. 

76. He knows what is before them, and what is
behind them. To Allah all matters are re-
ferred.
<!-- Muslims,  Kneel, and prostrate,
and worship your Lord, and do good deeds,
so that you may succeed. -->

78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur-
dened you in religion—the faith of your father Abraham. It is he who named you Mus-
lims before, and in this. 

So that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and you may
be witnesses over the people. So pray regularly, and give regular charity, and cleave to
Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.
