{{< s v="10" >}}  Except for him who snatches a fragment—he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.{{< s v="11" >}}  Inquire of them, “Are they more difficult to create, or the others We created?” We created them from sticky clay.

{{< s v="12" >}} But you wonder, and they ridicule. When reminded, they pay no attention.


14. And
when they see a sign, they ridicule.
And they say, “This is nothing but plain
magic.

bones, shall we be resurrected?

17. And our ancestors of old?”
Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally
subdued.”
19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be
staring.
20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day
of Judgment.”
21. “This is the Day of Separation which you
used to deny.
22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma-
tes, and what they used to worship.
23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to
Hell.

In fact, on that Day, they will be submis-
sive.
27. They will come to one another, question-
ing one another.
28. They will say, “You used to come at us
from the right.”
29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be-
lievers.
30. We had no authority over you. You your-
selves were rebellious people.
31. The Word of our Lord has been realized
against us. We are tasting it.

Hell.

the like of this let the workers work.
Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of

It is a tree that grows from the bottom of

They will eat from it, and fill their bellies

83. Of
his kind was Abraham.
When he came to his Lord with a sound
heart.
85. He said to his father and his people, “What
are you worshiping?
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you
want?
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of
the Worlds?”
84.
88. Then
he took a glance at the stars.
89. And
said, “I am sick.”
90. But they turned their backs on him, and
went away.
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said,
“will you not eat?
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”
93. Then
he turned on them, striking with his
right hand.
94. And
they came running towards him.
95. He
said, “Do you worship what you carve?
When Allah created you, and what you
manufacture?”
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw
him into the furnace.”
98. They wished him ill, but We made them
the losers.
99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and
He will guide me.”
96.
100. “My
Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
So We gave him good news of a clement
boy.
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a
dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are
commanded; you will find me, Allah willing,
one of the steadfast.”

We redeemed him with a great sacri-

We reward the doers of good.
111. He
was one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him good news of Isaac, a
prophet, one of the righteous.
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But
among their descendants are some who are
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to
themselves.
112.
114. And
We blessed Moses and Aaron.
And We delivered them and their people
from the terrible disaster.
1{{< s v="16" >}}And We supported them, and so they were
the victors.
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
ture.
118. And We guided them upon the straight
path.

Elijah was one of the messengers.
124. He
said to his people, “Do you not fear?
Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best
of creators?
126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your
ancestors.”
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they
will be brought forward.

to blame.
143. Had
he not been one of those who praised.
144. He would have stayed in its belly until the
Day they are raised.
145. Then We threw him into the wilderness,
and he was sick.
146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand,
or more.
148. And they believed, so We gave them en-
joyment for a while.
149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your
Lord, while for them the sons?”
