<!-- 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water
down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. -->


{{< s v="22">}} Allah sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Allah.

{{< s v="23">}} If you doubt the Prophet Mohammad, then call your witnesses if you are truthful.
- But {{< s v="24">}} you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
<!-- 23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter like these, and  -->

{{< s v="25">}} To those who believe and do righteous deeds, give the good news that they will:
- have gardens beneath which rivers flow
- be provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance<!-- , they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will --> 
- have pure spouses there who will live with them forever.

<!-- 26. Allah does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As
for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who -->

{{< s v="26">}} The disbelievers will say: “What did Allah intend by this example?” He leads many astray and guides many.

Reply that <!-- thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He --> Allah misleads only the evildoers.

{{< s v="27">}} The losers are those who:
- violate Allah’s covenant after its confirmation
- sever what Allah has commanded to be joined
- commit evil on earth

{{< s v="28">}} Allah:
- gave you life
- will put you to death
- will bring you to life
- return you to Himself

How can you deny Allah?

{{< s v="29">}} He:
- created for you everything on earth
- then turned to the heaven and made them 7 heavens

{{< s v="30">}} Allah said to the angels that He is placing a successor on earth. The angels said “Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?” 

He replied: “I know what you do not know.”

{{< s v="31">}} He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the angels,
and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.”

{{< s v="32">}} They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. <!-- It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.” -->

{{< s v="33">}} He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.”

When he told them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”

{{< s v="34">}} We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” 
- They bowed down, except for Satan. 
  - He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

{{< s v="35">}} We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”

{{< s v="36">}} But Satan caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in. 

We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of one another. And you will have residence on earth, and enjoyment for a while.”

{{< s v="37">}} Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him.

{{< s v="38-39">}} We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance—they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.


<!-- 39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire—wherein they will remain forever.” -->
