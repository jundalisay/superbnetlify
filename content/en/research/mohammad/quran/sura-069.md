{{< s v="2" >}}  What is the Inevitable Reality?
{{< s v="4" >}} The Thamood and Aad denied the Resurrection<!-- Catastrophe -->.
- {{< s v="5" >}} The Thamood were annihilated by the Overwhelming.
- {{< s v="6" >}} The Aad were annihilated by a furious, roaring wind.

{{< s v="7" >}} Allah unleashed it on them for 7 nights and 8 days, in succession. You could see
the people tossed around, as though they were stumps of hollow palm-trees.

{{< s v="8" >}} Can you see any remnant of them?

{{< s v="9" >}}  Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, and the Overturned Cities steeped in sin. 

{{< s v="10" >}} They disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an overpowering grip.
{{< s v="11-12" >}}  When the waters overflowed, We carried you in the cruising ship to remind you and make you remember it.

{{< s v="13-17" >}}
The Event will happen when:
- the Trumpet is sounded a single time.
- the earth and the mountains are lifted up, and crushed with a single crush.
- the heaven will crack so on that Day it will be frail.
- the angels will be ranged around its borders, while 8 will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day. 

{{< s v="18-20" >}} On that Day you will be exposed, and no secret of yours will remain hidden. 
- Those who believe will be given his record in their right hand and say: "Here, read my record! I was certain that I would be meeting my account."
  - {{< s v="21-24" >}} They will be in a pleasant life in an elevated garden, with low-hanging fruits. 
  - They will be told: Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put done in the past.

{{< s v="25-" >}} But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he will say:

{{< r a="Sinner" >}}
I wish I was never given my book. And never knew what my account was.

I wish that there were no eternity. 

My money and worldly power are gone. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
Take him and shackle him. Then burn him in the Blaze. Then tie him up in a chain 70 cubits long. 
{{< /l >}}

He did not:
- believe in Allah.
- feed the poor.

He does not have any friend here today.
- His food is the pus from his wounds. This is the food for sinners. 


{{< s v="40-52" >}} The Quran is the speech of a noble messenger, not of a poet or a soothsayer. 
- It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
- If the Prophet Muhammad had made up some false statements about Us, We would have cut his from the aorta causing immediate death. 
- The Quran is a reminder for the righteous.  

<!-- It invites him who once turned his back
and fled.
slashed his lifeline.
47. And none of you could have restrained Us from him. 17. 18. And accumulated and hoarded.
48. Surely, 19. Man was created restless.
49. And 20. Touched by adversity, he is fretful.
21. Touched by good, he is ungenerous.
it is a message for the righteous.
We know that some of you will reject
it.
50. And it is surely a source of grief for the un-
believers. -->
<!-- 51. Yet
it is the absolute truth.
52. So glorify the name of your Lord, the Mag-
nificent.
