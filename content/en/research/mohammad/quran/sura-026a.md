<!-- 1. Ta, Seen, Meem. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.
{{< s v="3" >}}  Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, because they do not become believers.
{{< s v="4" >}}  If We will, We can send down upon them a sign from heaven, at which their necks will
stay bent in humility.

{{< s v="5" >}}  No fresh reminder comes to them from the Most Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.

6. They have denied the truth, but soon will come to them the news of what they ridiculed.
7. Have they not seen the earth, and how many beautiful pairs We produced therein?
8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are not believers.

<!-- 9. Most surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful. -->
{{< s v="10" >}}  Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the tyrannical people.

{{< s v="11" >}}  The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”

He said, “My Lord, I fear they will rejectme.

13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is not fluent, so send Aaron too.

14. And they have a charge against me, so I fear they will kill me.”

15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our proofs. We will be with you, listening.

{{< s v="16" >}}Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Worlds.

31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”

17. Let So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, plain to see.

33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, for all to see.

34. He said to the dignitaries around him, “This is a skilled magician.

35. He intends to drive you out of your land with his magic, so what do you recommend?”

36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and send recruiters to the cities.


18. He 37. To bring the Jews go with us.'“
said, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed among us for many of your years?

19. And you committed that deed you committed, and you were ungrateful.”
20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those astray.
21. And I fled from you when I feared you; but my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one of the messengers.
22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, although you have enslaved the Jews?”
23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the Worlds?”
24. He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, if you are aware.”
25. He said to those around him, “Do you not hear?”
26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of old.”
27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is sent to you, is crazy.”
28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, and everything between them, if you understand.”
29. He said, “If you accept any god other than me, I will make you a prisoner.”
30. He said, “What if I bring you something convincing?”
32. you every experienced magician.”


the magicians were gathered for the appointment on a specified day.

39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all gathered?
40. That we may follow the magicians, if they
are the winners.”
41. When the magicians arrived, they said to
Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are
the winners?”
42. He said, “Yes, and you will be among those
favored.”
43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in-
tend to present.”
44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks,
and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will
be the winners.”
45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it
began swallowing their trickery.
38. So
46. And
the magicians fell down prostrating.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord
of the Worlds.
47.
48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”

He said, “Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? He must be your
chief, who taught you magic. You will soon know. I will cut off your hands and feet on
opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”

50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we will return.


51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our sins, since we are the first of the believers.”
52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My servants by night. You will be followed.”

Israel inherit them.
60. And
they pursued them at sunrise.
When the two groups sighted each other,
the followers of Moses said, “We are being
overtaken.”
62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will
guide me.”
63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with
your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each
part was like a huge hill.

We saved Moses and those with him,

sound heart.”
90. And Paradise will be brought near for the
righteous.
91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi-
ators.
92. And it will be said to them, “Where are
those you used to worship?”
93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help
themselves?”
94. Then they will be toppled into it, together
with the seducers.

124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do
one misled us except the sinners.
100. Now
you not fear?
we have no intercessors.
101. And
no sincere friend.
102. If only we could have another chance, we
would be among the faithful.”
103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
104. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The people of Noah disbelieved the mes-
sengers.
106. Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you
not fear?
105.
107. I
am to you a faithful messenger.
108. So
fear Allah, and obey me.

109. I
110. So
fear Allah, and obey me.”
They said, “Shall we believe in you, when
it is the lowliest who follow you?”
112. He said, “What do I know about what they
do?
113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if
you have sense.
114. And I am not about to drive away the be-
lievers.
111.
115. I
am only a clear warner.”
said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah,
you will be stoned.”
117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied
me.
118. So judge between me and them decisively,
and deliver me and the believers who are with
me.

128. Do you build a monument on every height
for vanity's sake?

forever?

134. And

I fear for you the punishment of an awe-
some Day.”
136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether
you lecture us, or do not lecture.
135.
137. This
is nothing but morals of the ancients.
138. And
we will not be punished.”
So they denied him, and We destroyed
them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of
them are not believers.
139.
140. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
141. Thamood
disbelieved the messengers.
When their brother Saleh said to them,
“Do you not fear?
142.
143. I
am to you a faithful messenger.
144. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.

do not obey the command of the ex-
travagant.
152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not
reform.”
153. They said, “You are surely one of the be-
witched.
154. You are nothing but a man like us. So
bring us a sign, if you are truthful.
155. He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her
turn of drinking, and you have your turn of
drinking—on a specified day.
156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the
punishment of a great day seizes you.”
157. But they slaughtered her, and became full
of remorse.
158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely
in this is a sign, but most of them are not be-
lievers.
151. And
159. Your
160. The
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
people of Lot disbelieved the messen-
gers.
161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do
you not fear?
162. I
am to you a faithful messenger.
163. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
164.
165. Do
you approach the males of the world?
And forsake the wives your Lord created
for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”
167. They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you
will be expelled.”
168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con-
duct.”
169. “My Lord, save me and my family from
what they do.”
170. So We saved him and his family, alto-
gether.
166.
Except for an old woman among those
who tarried.
We destroyed the others.
And We rained down on them a rain.
Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.
174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
173.
175. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The People of the Woods disbelieved the
messengers.
177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not
fear?
176.
178. I
am to you a trustworthy messenger.
179. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
180.
181. Give
full measure, and do not cheat.
182. And
weigh with accurate scales.
And do not defraud people of their be-
longings, and do not work corruption in the
land.
184. And fear Him who created you and the
masses of old.”
185. They said, “You are one of those be-
witched.
186. And you are nothing but a man like us;
and we think that you are a liar.
187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky,
if you are truthful.”
188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what
you do.”
189. But they denied him. So the punishment
of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the
punishment of a great day.
190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
183.
191. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the
Worlds.

Honest Spirit came down with it.27. THE ANT (an-Naml)

a clear Arabic tongue.
196. And
it is in the scriptures of the ancients.
197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars
of the Jews recognized it?
198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign-
ers.
199. And he had recited it to them, they still
would not have believed in it.
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts
of the guilty.
201. They will not believe in it until they wit-
ness the painful punishment.
202. It will come to them suddenly, while they
are unaware.
203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res-
pite?”
they seek to hasten Our punishment?
We let them enjoy
themselves for some years.
206. Then there comes to them what they were
promised.
207. Of what avail to them will be their past en-
joyments?
208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had
warners.

how they say what they do not do?

27. THE ANT (an-Naml)
{{< s v="1" >}}  Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran—a book that makes things clear.{{< s v="2" >}}  Guidance and good news for the believers.
Those who observe the prayers, and give charity regularly, and are certain of the Hereafter.
{{< s v="4" >}}  As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter: We made their deeds appear good to
them, so they wander aimlessly.
{{< s v="5" >}}  It is they who will receive the grievous punishment—and in the Hereafter they will be
the greatest losers.

6. You are receiving the Quran from an All-Wise, All-Knowing.
7. When Moses said to his family, “I have glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news
from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you
may warm yourselves.”

Then, when he reached it, he was called:
“Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He
who is around it, and glorified be Allah, Lord
of the Worlds.

9-10. O Moses Throw down your staff.” But when he saw it quivering, as though it were a demon, he
turned around not looking back. “O Moses, do not fear; the messengers do not fear in My presence.
{{< s v="11" >}}  But whoever has done wrong, and then substituted goodness in place of evil.


12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish—among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his people, for they are immoral people.”

13. Yet when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is obvious witchcraft.”
14. And they rejected them, although their souls were certain of them, out of wickedness
and pride. So see how the outcome was for the mischief-makers.
15. And We gave David and Solomon knowledge. They said, “Praise Allah, who has
favored us over many of His believing servants.”

{{< s v="16" >}}Solomon succeeded David and said, “O people, we were taught the language of birds, and we were given from everything. This is indeed a real blessing.”

17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized his troops of sprites, and men, and birds—all held in strict order.

18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of Ants, an ant said, “O ants! Go into your nests,
lest Solomon and his troops crush you without noticing.”

19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for
the blessings you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do good works
that please You. And admit me, by Your grace, into the company of Your virtuous
servants.”

20. Then he inspected the birds, and said, “Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he
among the absentees?

21. I will punish him most severely, or slay him, unless he gives me a valid excuse.”
22. But he did not stay for long. He said, “I have learnt something you did not know. I
have come to you from Sheba, with reliable information.

23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given of everything, and she has a mag-
nificent throne.

24. I found her and her people worshiping the sun, instead of Allah. Satan made their con-
duct appear good to them, and diverted them from the path, so they are not guided.
25. If only they would worship Allah, who brings to light the mysteries of the heavens
and the earth, and knows what you conceal
and what you reveal.

26. Allah—There is no god but He, the Lord of the Sublime Throne.”
27. He said, “We will see, whether you have
spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar.
28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to
them; then withdraw from them, and see how
they respond.”
29. She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter
was delivered to me.
30. It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Name
of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
31. Do not defy me, and come to me submis-
sively.’”
32. She said, “O counselors, advise me in this
matter of mine. I never make a decision un-
less you are present.”
33. They said, “We are a people of might and
great courage, but the decision is yours, so
consider what you wish to command.”
34. She said, “When kings enter a city, they
devastate it, and subjugate its dignified people. Thus they always do.


35. I am sending them a gift, and will see what
the envoys bring back.”

36. When he came to Solomon, he said, “Are you supplying me with money? What Allah
has given me is better than what He has given you. It is you who delight in your gift.
37. Go back to them. We will come upon them with troops they cannot resist; and we will ex-
pel them from there, disgraced and humiliated.”

38. He said, “O notables, which one of you will bring me her throne before they come to me
in submission?”

39. An imp of the sprites said, “I will bring it to you before you rise from your seat. I am
strong and reliable enough to do it.”

40. He who had knowledge from the Book said, “I will bring it to you before your glance
returns to you.” And when he saw it settled
before him, he said, “This is from the grace of
my Lord, to test me, whether I am grateful or
ungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude
is to his own credit; but he who is ungrate-
ful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”
41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and
we shall see whether she will be guided, or re-
mains one of the misguided.”
42. When she arrived, it was said, “Is your
throne like this?” She said, “As if this is it.”
“We were given knowledge before her, and
we were submissive.”
43. But she was prevented by what she wor-
shiped besides Allah; she belonged to a disbe-
lieving people.

44. It was said to her, “Go inside the palace.”

And when she saw it, she thought it was a
deep pond, and she bared her legs. He said,
“It is a palace paved with glass.” She said, “My
Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have
submitted with Solomon, to Allah, Lord of
the Worlds.”

45. And We sent to Thamood their brother Saleh: “Worship Allah.” But they became two
disputing factions.

46. He said, “O my people, why are you quick to do evil rather than good? If only you would
seek Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be shown mercy.”
47. They said, “We consider you an ill omen, and those with you.” He said, “Your omen is
with Allah. In fact, you are a people being tested.”
48. In the city was a gang of nine who made mischief in the land and did no good.
49. They said, “Swear by Allah to one another that we will attack him and his family by
night, and then tell his guardian, 'We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are
being truthful.'“

50. They planned a plan, and We planned a plan, but they did not notice.
51. So note the outcome of their planning; We
destroyed them and their people, altogether.
52. Here are their homes, in ruins, on account
of their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for
people who know.
53. And We saved those who believed and
were pious.
54. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do
you commit lewdness with open eyes?
55. Do you lust after men instead of women?
You are truly ignorant people.”
56. But the only response of his people was to
say, “Expel the family of Lot from your town.
They are purist people.”
57. So We saved him and his family, except for
his wife, whom We destined to be among the
laggards.
58. And We rained upon them a rain. Misera-
ble was the rain of those forewarned.
59. Say, “Praise Allah, and peace be upon His
servants whom He has selected. Is Allah bet-
ter, or what they associate?”
60. Or, who created the heavens and the earth,
and rains down water from the sky for you?
With it We produce gardens full of beauty,
whose trees you could not have produced. Is
14327. THE ANT (an-Naml)
there another god with Allah? But they are a
people who equate.
61. Or, who made the earth habitable, and
made rivers flow through it, and set moun-
tains on it, and placed a partition between the
two seas? Is there another god with Allah?
But most of them do not know.
62. Or, who answers the one in need when he
prays to Him, and relieves adversity, and
makes you successors on earth? Is there an-
other god with Allah? How hardly you pay at-
tention.
63. Or, who guides you through the darkness
of land and sea, and who sends the winds as
heralds of His mercy? Is there another god
with Allah? Most exalted is Allah, above what
they associate.
64. Or, who originates the creation and then
repeats it, and who gives you livelihood from
the sky and the earth? Is there another god
with Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if
you are truthful.”

65. Say, “No one in the heavens or on earth knows the future except Allah; and they do
not perceive when they will be resurrected.”

66. In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter is confused. In fact, they are in doubt about it.
In fact, they are blind to it.

67. Those who disbelieve say, “When we have become dust, and our ancestors, shall we be
brought out?

68. We were promised that before, we and our ancestors—these are nothing but legends of
the ancients.”

69. Say, travel through the earth, and observe the fate of the guilty.”
70. But do not grieve over them, and do not be
troubled by what they plot.
71. And they say, “When is this promise, if you
are truthful?”
72. Say, “Perhaps some of what you are impa-
tient for has drawn near.”
73. Your Lord is gracious towards humanity,
but most of them are not thankful.
And your Lord knows what their hearts
conceal, and what they reveal.
75. There is no mystery in the heaven and the
earth, but it is in a Clear Book.
76. This Quran relates to the Jews
most of what they differ about.
77. And it is guidance and mercy for the be-
lievers.
78. Your Lord will judge between them by His
wisdom. He is the Almighty, the All-Know-
ing.
79. So rely on Allah. You are upon the clear
truth.
80. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can
you make the deaf hear the call if they turn
their backs and flee.
81. Nor can you guide the blind out of their
straying. You can make no one listen, except
those who believe in Our verses; for they are
Muslims.
82. And when the Word has fallen on them,
We will bring out for them from the earth a
creature which will say to them that the peo-
ple are uncertain of Our revelations.
83. On the Day when We gather from every
community a group of those who rejected
Our revelations; and they will be restrained.
84. Until, when they arrive, He will say, “Did
you reject My revelations without compre-
hending them? Or what is it you were doing?”
85. The Word will come down upon them for
their wrongdoing, and they will not speak.
86. Do they not see that We made the night for
them to rest therein, and the day for visibil-
ity? Surely in that are signs for people who
believe.
87. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown,
everyone in the heavens and the earth will be
horrified, except whomever Allah wills; and
everyone will come before Him in humility.
88. And you see the mountains, and imagine
them fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the clouds—the making of Allah, who has per-
fected everything. He is fully Informed of
what you do.

89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better
than it—and they will be safe from the hor-
rors of that Day.
90. But whoever brings evil—their faces will be
tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded
except for what you used to do?
91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of
this town, who has sanctified it, and to
Whom everything belongs; and I was com-
manded to be of those who submit.
92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is
guided—is guided to his own advantage. And
whoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of
the warners.”
93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will
show you His signs, and you will recognize
them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you
do.”
