{{< s v="1" >}}  When:
- the sky is ruptured and hearkens to its Lord, as it must.
- {{< s v="3" >}} the earth is leveled out and casts out what is in it, becomes empty and hearkens to its Lord, as it must.

O mankind! You are laboring towards your Lord, and you will meet Him.

7. He who is given his book in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy account.

{{< s v="9" >}}  And will return to his family delighted.

{{< s v="10-12" >}} But he who is given his book behind his back, he will:
- cry out for death and
- enter the Blaze.

He:
- used to be happy among his family.
- thought he would never return.

{{< s v="15" >}} In fact, his Lord was watching him. 

{{< s v="16-19" >}} I swear:
- by the twilight
- by the night
- by the moon as it grows full.

I swear that you will experience this stage after stage. 

20. So why do they not:
- believe when the QurÕŒn is recited to them and
- prostrate to Allah?

<!-- 22. The disbelievers deny,
23. And AllŒh is most knowing of what they keep within themselves. -->

24. So give them tidings of a painful punishment,
<!-- 25. Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them
is a reward uninterrupted.
 -->
