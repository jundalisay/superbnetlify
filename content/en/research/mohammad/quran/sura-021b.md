<!-- 48. We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion,
and illumination, and a reminder for the
righteous.
49. Those who fear their Lord in private, and
are apprehensive of the Hour.
50. This too is a blessed message that We re-
vealed. Are you going to deny it?
51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly,
and We knew him well.
52. When he said to his father and his people,
“What are these statues to which you are de-
voted?”
53. They said, “We found our parents wor-
shiping them.”
54. He said, “You and your parents are in evi-
dent error.”
55. They said, “Are you telling us the truth, or
are you just playing?”
56. He said, “Your Lord is the Lord of the
heavens and the earth, the One who created
them, and I bear witness to that.
57. “By Allah, I will have a plan for your statues
after you have gone away.”
58. So he reduced them into pieces, except for
their biggest, that they may return to it.
59. They said, “Who did this to our gods? He
is certainly one of the wrongdoers.”
60. They said, “We heard a youth mentioning
them. He is called Abraham.”
61. They said, “Bring him before the eyes of the
people, so that they may witness.”
62. They said, “Are you the one who did this to
our gods, O Abraham?”
63. He said, “But it was this biggest of them
that did it. Ask them, if they can speak.”
64. Then they turned to one another, and said,
“You yourselves are the wrongdoers.”
65. But they reverted to their old ideas: “You
certainly know that these do not speak.”
66. He said, “Do you worship, instead of Allah,
what can neither benefit you in anything, nor
harm you?
67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in-
stead of Allah. Do you not understand?”
68. They said, “Burn him and support your
gods, if you are going to act.”
69. We said, “O fire, be coolness and safety
upon Abraham.”
70. They planned to harm him, but We made
them the worst losers.
71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to the land
that We blessed for all people.
72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a
gift; and each We made righteous.
73. And We made them leaders, guiding by
Our command; and We inspired them to do
good works, and to observe the prayer, and to
give out charity. They were devoted servants
to Us. -->

{{< s v="74" >}} We gave Lot judgment and knowledge. 
- We delivered him from the town that practiced the abominations. 
- They were wicked and perverted people.
- 75. We admitted him into Our mercy; for He was one of the righteous.


{{< s v="76" >}} We delivered Noah and his family from the great disaster.
- 77. We supported him against the people who rejected Our signs. They were an evil people, so We drowned them all.

78. And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the case of the field, when some people’s sheep wandered therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment.

79. We made Solomon understand it, and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge.
<!-- And We subjected the mountains along with
David to sing Our praises, and the birds as
well—surely We did. -->

<!-- 80. And We taught him the making of shields for you, to protect you from your violence.
Are you, then, appreciative? -->

<!-- 81. And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing at His command towards the land that We
have blessed. We are aware of everything.

82. And of the devils were some that dived for him, and performed other, lesser tasks. But
We kept them restrained. -->

83. Job cried out to his Lord: “Great harm has afflicted me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”

84. So We answered him, lifted his suffering, and restored his family to him, and their like with them—a mercy from Us, and a reminder for the worshipers.

85-86. We admitted Ishmael, Enoch, and Ezekiel into Our mercy. They were steadfast and righteous.

87. Jonah stormed out in fury, thinking We had no power over him. But then He cried out in the darkness, “There is no god but You! Glory to You! I was one of the wrongdoers!”
88. So We answered him, and saved him from the affliction. Thus We save the faithful.
89. Zechariah, when he called out to his Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, even though you are the Best of heirs.”

90. So We answered him, and gave him John.

We cured his wife for him. They used to
vie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call
on Us in love and awe, and they used to hum-
ble themselves to Us.

91. And she who guarded her virginity. We breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her and her son a sign to the world.

92. This community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.
93. But they splintered themselves into factions. They will all return to Us.
94. Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a believer, his effort will not be denied. We are
writing it down for him. 

95. There is a ban on the town that We had destroyed—that they will not return. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they swarm down from every mound.

97. The promise of truth has drawn near. The eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in horror: “Woe to us. We were oblivious to this. In fact, we were wrongdoers.”

98. You and what you worship besides Allah are fuel for Hell. You will descend into it.

99. Had these been gods, they would not have descended into it. All will abide in it.

100. In it they will wail. In it they will not hear. 
for those who deserved goodness from
Us—these will be kept away from it.

102. They will not hear its hissing, and they will forever abide in what their hearts desire.

103. The Supreme Fear will not worry them, and the angels will receive them: “This is your
Day which you were promised.”

104. On the Day when We fold the heaven, like the folding of a book. Just as We began the first creation, We will repeat it—a promise binding on Us. We will act.

105. We have written in the Psalms, after the Reminder, that the earth will be inherited by My righteous servants.

<!-- 106. Indeed, in this is a message for people who worship.

107. We did not send you except as mercy to mankind.

108. Say, “It is revealed to me that your God is
One God. Are you going to submit?”

109. But if they turn away, say, “I have informed you sufficiently. Although I do not
know whether what you are promised is near or far.”

110. He knows what is said openly, and He knows what you conceal.

111. “And I do not know whether it is perhaps a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”

112. He said, “My Lord, judge with justice.”

And, “Our Lord is the Gracious, Whose help
is sought against what you allege.”
