{{< s v="1" >}}  [The Day of Judgement will be] unleashed in succession. It will:
- storm turbulently
- scatter far and wide
- separate decisively
- delivering a message, either excusing or warning

On that day:
- the stars will be obliterated
- the sky is fractured
- the mountains are blown away
- the messengers are alerted

It will be deferred until the Day of Decision.

And what will teach you what the Day of
Decision is?


{{< s v="16" >}}Did we not destroy the ancients?
- We will follow them with the later ones like We deal with the criminals.

We created you from a liquid disdained and placed it in a the womb

We made the earth a container of the living and the dead?

37. Woe, that Day, to the deniers. This is the Day of Judgement; We will have assembled you
and the former peoples.

39. So if you have a plan, then plan against Me.
