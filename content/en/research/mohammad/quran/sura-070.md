{{< s v="1" >}}  Someone asked about the imminent torment. 

The disbelievers cannot repel it.

<!-- Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. -->
The angels and the Spirit ascend to Allah on a Day lasting 50,000 years. {{< s v="4" >}} So be graciously patient. 

6. They see it not coming soon. But We see it as coming very soon. 

8. On that Day:
- the sky will be like molten brass.{{< s v="9" >}} 
- the mountains will be like tufted wool.{{< s v="10" >}}  
- No friend will care about his friend. They will be shown each other.
- The criminal will wish that he could be redeemed from the punishment by:
  - his children.
  - spouse
  - his brother.
  - his family that sheltered him.
  - everyone on earth


But no! It will be a Raging Fire that will burn them. It is meant for those who have hoarded wealth. 


{{< s v="19" >}} Mankind was created to be anxious about wealth. 
- He is impatient with it when evil touches him. 
- He withholds it when good touches him. 

This does not afflict those who:
- are constant in their prayer
- are meant to receive rightful donations, such as:
  - the beggars and the deprived.
- affirm the Day of Judgment.
- fear the punishment of their Lord.

No one is safe from their Lord’s punishment except for:
- the wives or female slaves who guard their chastity.
  - But whoever seeks to go beyond that are the transgressors.
- those who honor their trusts and their pledges.
- those who stand by their testimonies.

35. These will be honored in Gardens.

37. The disbelievers mocked the Prophet Mohammad saying that they will enter paradise before the believers do. 

38. They think they will be admitted into the Garden of Bliss. 
39. No! They will be replaced with people better than they. 

42.  So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until
they meet their Day. 

<!-- 43. The Day when they will emerge from the
tombs in a rush, as though they were hurry-
ing towards a target.
44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu-
miliation. This is the Day which they were
promised.
