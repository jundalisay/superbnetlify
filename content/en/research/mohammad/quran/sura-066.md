{{< s v="1" >}}  O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah has permitted for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

{{< s v="2" >}}  Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of your oaths. <!-- Allah is your Master. He is the
All-Knowing, the Most Wise. -->

{{< s v="3" >}}  The Prophet told something in confidence to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it,
and Allah made it known to him; he communicated part of it, and he avoided another part. 

Then, when he informed her of it, she said, “Who informed you of this?” He said,
“The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, informed me.”{{< s v="4" >}}  If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have
listened. But if you band together against
him, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and
the righteous believers. 

In addition, the angels will assist him.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will give him in exchange wives better than you:
submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, devout, fasting—previously married, or virgins.
6. Muslims,  Protect yourselves and
your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people
and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow-
erful. They never disobey Allah in anything
He commands them, and they carry out
whatever they are commanded.
7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses
today. You are being repaid for what you
used to do.
8. Muslims,  Repent to Allah with
sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will
remit your sins, and admit you into gardens
beneath which rivers flow, on the Day when
Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and
those who believed with him. Their light
streaming before them, and to their right,
they will say, “Our Lord, complete our light
for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all
things.”{{< s v="9" >}}  O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe-
lievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with
them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable
destination!{{< s v="10" >}}  Allah illustrates an example of those who
disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of
Lot. They were under two of Our righteous
servants, but they betrayed them. They
availed them nothing against Allah, and it
was said, “Enter the Fire with those who are
entering.”{{< s v="11" >}}  And Allah illustrates an example of those
who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she
said, “My Lord, build for me, with you, a
house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh
and his works, and save me from the wrong-
doing people.”
12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who
guarded her womb, and so We breathed into
her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the
truth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and
was one of the devout.
