{{< s v="156" >}} The disbelievers said of their brethren who went on the offensive: “Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed. <!-- So that Allah
may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. -->

Muslims, do not be like the disbelievers. 


{{< s v="157" >}} If you are killed in the cause of Allah, to Allah you will be gathered up. <!-- —forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than what they hoard. -->


{{< s v="159">}}  It is by of grace from Allah that you were gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the conduct of affairs. 

When you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. 

160. If Allah supports you, there is none who can overcome you. But if He fails you, who is
there to help you after Him? So in Allah let the believers put their trust.

161. It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly.

Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.

162. Is someone who pursues Allah's approval the same as someone who incurs Allah's
wrath and his refuge is Hell—the miserable destination?

163. They have different ranks with Allah, and Allah is Seeing of what they do.

164. Allah has blessed the believers, as He raised up among them a messenger from among themselves, who recites to them His revelations, and purifies them, and teaches them the Scripture and wisdom; although before that they were in evident error.

165. And when a calamity befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you said,
“How is this?” Say, “It is from your own selves.”

166. What befell you on the day the two armies clashed was with Allah’s permission; that He may know the believers.

167. And that He may know the hypocrites. 

And it was said to them, “Come, fight in the cause of Allah, or contribute.” They said, “If we knew how to fight, we would have followed you.” On that day they were closer to infidelity than they were to faith. 

They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts; but Allah knows what they hide.

168. Those who said of their brethren, as they stayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.” Say, “Then avert
death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”

169. Do not consider those killed in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their Lord, well provided for.

170. Delighting in what Allah has given them out of His grace, and happy for those who have not yet joined them; that they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.

171. They rejoice in grace from Allah, and bounty, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the faithful.

172. Those who responded to Allah and the Messenger, despite the persecution they had suffered. For the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.

173. Those to whom the people have said, “The people have mobilized against you, so fear them.” But this only increased them in faith, and they said, “Allah is enough for us; He is the Excellent Protector.”

174. So they came back with grace from Allah, and bounty, and no harm having touched them. They pursued what pleases Allah. Allah possesses immense grace.

175. That is only Satan frightening his partisans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.

176. Do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah in the least. 

<!-- Allah desires to give them no
share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment
awaits them. -->

177. Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm Allah in the least. A painful torment awaits them.

178. Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good. In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment awaits them.

179. Allah will not leave the believers as you are, without distinguishing the wicked from
the sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the future, but Allah elects from among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers. If you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward.


180. Those who withhold what Allah has given them of his bounty should not assume that is
good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. 

They will be encircled by their hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the
inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is well acquainted with what you do.

181. Allah has heard the statement of those who said, “Allah is poor, and we are rich.” We
will write down what they said, and their wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will
say, “Taste the torment of the burning.”

182. “This is on account of what your hands have forwarded, and because Allah is not unjust towards the creatures.”

183. Those who said, “Allah has made a covenant with us, that we shall not believe in any
messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have
come to you before me with proofs, and with what you asked for; so why did you assassinate them, if you are truthful?” 

184. If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying. They came with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Scripture.

185. Every soul will have a taste of death, and you will receive your recompense on the Day
of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The
life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.

186. You will be tested through your possessions and your persons; and you will hear
from those who received the Scripture before
you, and from the idol worshipers, much abuse. But if you persevere and lead a right-
eous life—that indeed is a mark of great determination.

187. Allah received a pledge from those who were given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim
it to the people, and not conceal it.” 

But they disregarded it behind their backs, and exchanged it for a small price. What a miserable
exchange they made.

188. Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised
for what they have not done—do not think they can evade the punishment. They will
have a painful punishment.

189. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Allah has power over
all things.

190. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day,
are signs for people of understanding.

191. Those who remember Allah while standing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”

<!-- 192. “Our Lord, whomever You commit to the Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers will have no helpers.” -->

193. “Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit our misdeeds, and make us die in the company of the virtuous.”

194. “Our Lord, and give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and
do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Surely You never break a promise.”


195. And so their Lord answered them: “I will not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female. 
You are one of another. For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and fought and were killed—I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow—a reward from Allah. With Allah is the ultimate reward.”

196. Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ movements in the land.

197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is Hell.

198. As for those who feared their Lord: for them will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever—hospitality from Allah. What Allah possesses is best for the just.

199. Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They are humble before Allah, and
they do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap price. These will have their reward with their Lord.<!--  Allah is swift in reckoning. -->

200. For you to thrive:
- Be patient and advocate patience
- Be united
- Revere Allah
