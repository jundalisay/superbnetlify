## 90. The City (al-Balad) 

{{< s v="1" >}} I swear by this city of Makkah

{{< s v="2" >}} You Muúammad, are free of restriction in this city. 

3. And [by] the father 1794 and that which was born [of him],
4. We have certainly created man into hardship.
5. Does he think that never will anyone overcome him?
6. He says, "I have spent wealth in abundance."
7. Does he think that no one has seen him?
8. Have We not made for him two eyes?
9. And a tongue and two lips?
10. And have shown him the two ways? 1795
11. But he has not broken through the difficult pass. 1796
12. And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the
difficult pass?
13. It is the freeing of a slave
14. Or feeding on a day of severe hunger
15. An orphan of near relationship
16. Or a needy person in misery
17. And then being among those who believed and advised one
another to patience and advised one another to compassion.
18. Those are the companions of the right.
19. But they who disbelieved in Our signs – those are the companions of the left.
20. Over them will be fire closed in.



## 91. THE SUN (ash-Shams)

By: 
- the sun and its radiance.
- the moon as it follows it.
- the day
- the night
- the sky
- the earth
- the soul and He who proportioned it and inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness,

{{< s v="9-10">}} He who:
- purifies his soul has succeeded 
- corrupts his soul has failed. 

{{< s v="11-12">}} Tham´d denied their prophet by reason of their transgression, when the most wretched of them was sent forth.

{{< s v="13">}} Salih, the messenger of Allah, said to them: "Do not harm the she-camel of Allah or [prevent her from] her drink."

14. But they denied him and hamstrung 1804 her. So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it
equal [upon all of them].

15. And He does not fear the consequence thereof.
