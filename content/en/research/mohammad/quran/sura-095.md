By the morning brightness
2. And [by] the night when it covers with darkness, 1811
3. Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Mu√∫ammad], nor
has He detested [you].
4. And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life].
5. And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.
6. Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?
7. And He found you lost and guided [you],
8. And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient.
9. So as for the orphan, do not oppress [him].
10. And as for the petitioner, 1812 do not repel [him].
11. But as for the favor of your Lord, report [it].



## 94. THE SOOTHING (ash-Sharh)

Oh Mohammad, we:
- expanded your breast for you, 
- removed from you your burden
- raised your reputation high.

With hardship comes relief. Your hardship ease, so that when you have finished your duties, then stand up for worship and to your Lord direct our longing.



## 95. THE FIG (at-Tin)

By:
- {{< s v="1" >}} the fig and the olive
- {{< s v="2" >}} Mount Sinai 
- {{< s v="3" >}} this secure city [i.e., Makkah]

{{< s v="4" >}} We have certainly created man in the best of stature, then returned him to the lowest of the low, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have a reward uninterrupted.

Why do you still deny the Recompense?
