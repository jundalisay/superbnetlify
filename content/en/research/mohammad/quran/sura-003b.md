{{< s v="28" >}} Believers should not have disbelievers for friends over believers, unless it is to protect yourselves against them.

<!-- {{< s v="29" >}} Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your hearts, or disclose it, Allah knows it.” He knows everything in the heavens and the earth. Allah is Powerful over everything.

{{< s v="30" >}} On the Day when every soul finds all the good it has done presented. And as for the
evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distance between them. Allah cautions you of
Himself. Allah is Kind towards the servants.  -->


<!-- {{< s v="31" >}} Say:
- “If you love Allah, then follow me. Allah will love you and will forgive you your sins.” 
-  “{{< s v="32" >}} Obey Allah and the Messenger.” 

But if they turn away then Allah does not love the faithless. -->


{{< s v="33" >}} Over all mankind, Allah chose:
- Adam
- Noah
- the family of Abraham
- the family of Imran

<!-- {{< s v="34" >}} Offspring one of the other. Allah is Hearer and Knower. -->

{{< s v="35" >}} The wife of Imran said:

My Lord, I have dedicated to You what is in my womb so accept from me. 

{{< s v="36" >}} She gave birth to a girl:

{{< l a="Wife of Imran" >}}
My Lord, I have delivered a female. The male is not like the female. 

I have named her Mary, and have commended her and her descendants to Your protection”
{{< /l >}}



{{< s v="37" >}} Her Lord accepted her with a gracious reception, and brought her a beautiful upbringing, and entrusted her to the care of Zechariah.

Whenever Zechariah entered upon her in the sanctuary, he found her with provisions.

{{< l a="Zechariah" >}}
Mary, where did you get this?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mary" >}}
It is from Allah. He provides to whom He wills without reckoning.
{{< /r >}}



{{< s v="38" >}} Thereupon, Zechariah prayed to his Lord:

{{< l a="Zechariah" >}}
My Lord, bestow on me good offspring.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="39" >}} Then the angels called out to him, as he stood praying in the sanctuary: 

{{< r a="Angels" >}}
John is an honorable, moral prophet.  Allah gives you good news confirming a Word from Allah from John.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Zechariah" >}}
My Lord, how will I have a son, when old age has overtaken me, and my wife is barren? Give me a sign.” 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Allah" >}}
Your sign is that you shall not speak to the people for three days, except by gestures. And remember your Lord much, and praise in the evening and the morning.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Angels" >}}
O Mary, Allah has chosen you, and has purified you. He has chosen you over all the women of the world.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- 44. These are accounts from the Unseen, which We reveal to you. You were not with them when they cast their lots as to which of them would take charge of Mary; nor were you with them as they quarreled. -->

{{< s v="46" >}}
{{< r a="Angels" >}}
Mary, Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name is the Messiah, Jesus, well-esteemed in this world and the next, and one of the nearest.

He will:
- speak to the people from the crib and in adulthood, and
- be one of the righteous.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
My Lord, how can I have a child, when no man has touched me?” 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Angels" >}}
Allah creates whatever He wills. To have anything done, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.
{{< /r >}}


Jesus was born and was taught by Allah the Scripture, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel.

{{< s v="50-51" >}} Jesus said to the Jews: 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. 

I make for you a clay bird then I breathe into it. It becomes a bird by Allah’s leave.

I heal the blind and the leprous. I revive the dead, by Allah’s leave.

I tell you what you eat and what you store in your homes. In that is a sign for you, if you are believers.

I verify what lies before me of the Torah. I make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah and obey me.
<!-- 51. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.” -->
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="52-53" >}} Jesus sensed their disbelief:

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Who are my allies towards Allah?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
We are. We believe in Allah and submit.

We believe what You have revealed through the Messenger, so count us among the witnesses.
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="54-57" >}} They planned, and Allah planned; but Allah is the Best of planners.

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
Jesus, I am:
- ending your life
- raising you to Me, and
- clearing you of those who disbelieve. 

I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection.

Then to Me is your return; then I will judge between you regarding what you were disputing.

<!-- As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment, in this world
and the next, and they will have no helpers.  -->

<!-- 57. And as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards in full.
Allah does not love the unjust.” -->
{{< /l >}}


<!-- 58. This is what We recite to you of the Verses and the Wise Reminder. -->
