{{< s v="1" >}}  By the star as it goes down.

{{< s v="2" >}}  The Prophet Mohammad:
- has not strayed nor erred. 
- {{< s v="3" >}} nor does he speak out of his own inclination.

{{< s v="4" >}} He speaks from a revelation revealed, {{< s v="5" >}} taught to him by the extremely powerful Gabriel. 

Gabriel appeared in his true form to Mohammad while Mohammad's mind was in the higher part of the sky.
- Then Gabriel approached and descended and was at a distance of two bow-lengths or nearer, then revealed to Mohammad

Mohammad's heart did not lie about what it saw.
- He saw Gabriel at another instance at the Lotus Tree of the Utmost Boundary
  - Near it is the Garden of Refuge covered by the Lotus Tree 
- Mohammad's sight did not waver, nor did it exceed the limit of the Garden.
  - He certanly saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.

Do you believe:
- in al-Lat, al-Uzza, Manat, the third one the other [Shiva, Shakti, Brahma?]
- that Allah is female [Shakti] and you are males [Shiva]?

{{< s v="22" >}} How absurd. 

These are nothing but names, which your ancestors devised. They:
- have no authority from Allah
- follow only assumptions, and what the ego desires
- have forgotten the guidance from their Lord.

{{< s v="24" >}} Do humans believe whatever he wants?
- {{< s v="27" >}} Those who do not believe in the Hereafter assign female names to the angels. But they are ignorant. 
- {{< s v="28" >}} Avoid those who have:
  - turned away from Our remembrance, and
  - desire only the present life. They only know the present life. 

<!-- 25. To
Allah belong the Last and the First.
many an angel is there in the heavens
whose intercession avails nothing, except af-
ter Allah gives permission to whomever He
wills, and approves? -->



<!-- 28. They have no knowledge of that. They only
follow assumptions, and assumptions are no
substitute for the truth. -->



<!-- 30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your
Lord knows best who has strayed from His
path, and He knows best who has accepted
guidance. -->

{{< s v="31" >}} Allah will repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and recompense those who do good.

<!-- 32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecencies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is
of Vast Forgiveness. 

He knows you well, ever since He created you from the earth, and ever
since you were embryos in your mothers’
wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue;
He is fully aware of the righteous.
 -->
<!-- 26. How Have you considered him who turned away? -->


<!-- 34. And
gave a little, and held back?
he possess knowledge of the unseen,
and can therefore foresee?

36. Or was he not informed of what is in the
Scrolls of Moses?

of Abraham, who fulfilled?
no soul bears the burdens of another
soul.

39. And that the human being attains only
what he strives for.

40. And
that his efforts will be witnessed.
Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest
reward. -->

<!-- that it is He who causes laughter and
weeping.
43. And
44. And
that it is He who gives death and life. -->

{{< s v="42-62" >}}
Allah:
- is the finality
- created the two kinds—the male and the female from a sperm drop, when emitted.
<!-- 47. And that upon Him is the next existence.
48. And that it is He who enriches and impoverishes. -->
- is the Lord of Sirius.
- destroyed:
  - the first people of Aad and Thamood, sparing no one.
  - the people of Noah before that for they were most unjust and most oppressive.

<!-- He toppled the ruined cities.
And covered them with whatever covered
them.
 -->
<!-- 55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you
deny?
56. This is a warning, just like the first warn-
ings.
54.
57. The
inevitable is imminent.
58. None
203
besides Allah can unveil it.

54. THE MOON (al-Qamar)
59. Do
you marvel at this discourse?
60. And laugh, and do not weep?
61. Lost in your frivolity?
62. So
And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone
who would take heed?
{{< s v="16" >}}So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there
anyone who would learn?
18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My
punishment and My warnings?
19. We unleashed upon them a screaming
wind, on a day of unrelenting misery.
20. Plucking the people away, as though they
were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
21. So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is
there anyone who would remember?
15.
bow down to Allah, and worship!
