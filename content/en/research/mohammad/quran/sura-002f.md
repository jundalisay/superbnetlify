{{< s v="142">}} The ignorant will say, “What has turned them away from the direction of prayer [qiblah] they once followed?” 

<!-- Say, “To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.” -->

{{< s v="143">}} We made you a moderate community, so that:
- you may be witnesses to humanity, and
- the Messenger may be a witness to you. 

We only established the direction of prayer, which you once followed so that We may distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. 

It is indeed difficult, except for those whom Allah has guided. But Allah would never let you lose your faith. 

{{< s v="144" >}} Muhammad, We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. 
- So We will turn you towards a direction that will satisfy you. 
- So face towards the Kabah wherever you may be.

{{< s v="145" >}} The Jews and the Christians will not follow your prayer direction. 
- Nor are you to follow their direction. 
- Nor do they follow the direction of one another. 

If you were to follow their desires, after knowing what you now know, you would be one of the wrongdoers.

<!-- 146. Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children. But some of them conceal the truth
while they know. -->

<!-- 147. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be a skeptic. -->

{{< s v="148" >}} Each religion has a prayer-direction which it turns towards. 
- Therefore, race towards goodness. 
- Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you all together.


{{< s v="149-150" >}} Wherever you come from, face towards the Kabbah:
- when you go out to prayer. 
- so that the people may not have any argument against you—except those who do wrong among them. 

So do not fear them, but fear Me, that I may complete My blessings on you and guide you.

{{< s v="151" >}} We sent to you a messenger from among you, who:
- recites Our revelations to you
- purifies you
- teaches you the Book and wisdom. 

{{< s v="152" >}} So remember Me, and I will remember you. And thank Me, and do not be ungrateful.

{{< s v="153" >}} Seek help through patience and prayers.

{{< s v="154" >}} Do not call those who are killed in the cause of Allah as “Dead”.  They are alive, but are not perceiveable.

{{< s v="155" >}} We will certainly test you with:
- some fear and hunger
- some loss of possessions, lives, and crops. 

But give good news to the steadfast.


{{< s v="156-157" >}} The people who will receive blessings and mercy from their Lord are those who say durng a calamity: “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will return”.

{{< s v="158" >}} Safa and Marwa are among the places designated for the rites of úajj and Ôumrah by Allah.

Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, or performs the Umrah, commits no error by circulating between them. 

<!-- Whoever volunteers good—Allah is Appreciative and
Cognizant. -->

{{< s v="159" >}} Allah curses those who suppress the proofs and the guidance that We have revealed. 

<!-- 160. Except those who repent, and reform, and proclaim. Those—I will accept their repentance.  -->

<!-- 161. But as for those who reject faith, and die rejecting—those—upon them is the curse of
Allah, and of the angels, and of all humanity.

162. They will remain under it forever, and the torment will not be lightened for them, and
they will not be reprieved. -->

<!-- 163. Your God is one God. There is no god but
He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate. -->

{{< s v="164" >}} For people who understand, there are signs in: 
- the creation of the heavens and the earth
- the alternation of night and day
- the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind
- the water that Allah sends down from the sky and revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures
- the changing of the winds
- the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth.


{{< s v="165" >}} Some people have humans equal to Allah. 
- They love them as they love Allah. 
- But those who believe have greater love for Allah.

Those wrongdoers would realize that all power is Allah’s 


{{< s v="166" >}} They will then disown their followers who will say: “If only we can have another chance, we will disown them, as they disowned us.”
