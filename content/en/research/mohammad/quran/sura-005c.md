description: "O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying for you much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and overlooking much. A light from Allah has come to you, and a clear Book."

{{< s v="55" >}} Your allies are:
- Allah
- His Messenger
- those who believe
  - those who pray regularly, give charity, and bow down. 

{{< s v="56" >}} Whoever allies himself with them will be victorious because the Party of Allah is the victorious.

{{< s v="57" >}} Do not befriend those who mock your religion as a sport, whether they from:
- among those who were given the Scripture before you, or
- the disbelievers. 

58. When you call to the prayer, they take it as a joke and a trifle. That is because they are people who do not reason.
59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah, and
in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed previously; and most of you are sinners?”

60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that for retribution from Allah? He whom Allah
has cursed, and with whom He became angry; and He turned some of them into apes,
and swine, and idol worshipers. 

These are in a worse position, and further away from the right way.”

61. When they come to you, they say, “We believe,” though they have entered with disbelief, and they have departed with it. But Allah is well aware of what they hide.

62. You see many of them competing with one another in sin and hostility, and their con-
suming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.
63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not prevent them from speaking sinfully and from
consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what they have been doing.
The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” 

It is their hands that are tied, and they are cursed for what they say. In fact, His hands are out-
stretched; He gives as He wills. 

Certainly, what was revealed to your from your Lord will increase many of them in defiance and
blasphemy. And We placed between them enmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec-
tion. 

Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to
spread corruption on earth. <!-- Allah does not love the corrupters. -->

65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed and been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.

66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gospel, and what was revealed to them from their
Lord, they would have consumed amply from above them, and from beneath their feet.
Among them is a moderate community, but evil is what many of them are doing.

67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to you from your Lord. But if you do not, then
you would not have delivered His message. 

And Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the
Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord.” But what is revealed to you from
your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for
the disbelieving people.

69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians—whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and does what is right—they have nothing to fear, nor
shall they grieve.

70. We made a covenant with the Jews, and We sent to them messengers. 

Whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire, some of them they accused of lying, and others they put to death.

71. They assumed there would be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Allah redeemed them, but then again many of them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is Seeing of what they do.

72. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary.” 

But the Messiah himself said, “O Jews, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever associates others with Allah, Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. 

The wrongdoers have no saviors.”

73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the third of three.” But there is no deity except
the One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those among them who disbelieve.

74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His
forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes-
senger, before whom other Messengers had
passed away, and his mother was a woman of
truth. They both used to eat food. Note how
We make clear the revelations to them; then
note how deluded they are.

76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to harm or benefit you?” But
Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.

77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion beyond the truth;
and do not follow the opinions of people who went astray before, and misled many, and
themselves strayed off the balanced way.”

78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from among the Jews by the tongue of
David and Jesus son of Mary. That is because they rebelled and used to transgress.
79. They used not to prevent one another from the wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what
they used to do.

80. You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Terrible is what their souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah fell upon them, and in the torment they will remain.

Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, they would not have befriended them. But many of them are immoral.

82. You will find that the people most hostile towards the believers are the Jews and the
polytheists. And you will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those
who say, “We are Christians.” That is because among them are priests and monks, and they
are not arrogant.

83. And when they hear what was revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing
with tears, as they recognize the truth in it.

They say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so count us among the witnesses.”
84. “And why should we not believe in Allah, and in the truth that has come to us, and hope
that our Lord will include us among the righteous people?”

85. Allah will reward them for what they say—Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. Such is the reward of the righteous.

86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.

87. Muslims,  Do not prohibit the good things Allah has permitted for you, and do not commit aggression. Allah does not love the aggressors.
88. And eat of the lawful and good things Allah has provided for you; and be conscious of Allah, in whom you are believers.

89. Allah does not hold you accountable for your unintended oaths, but He holds you accountable for your binding oaths. The atonement for it is by feeding ten needy people
from the average of what you feed your families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days. That is the atonement for
breaking your oaths when you have sworn them. 

So keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear His Revelations to you, that you may be grateful.

90. Muslims,  Intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are abominations of Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.

91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you not desist?

92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and be cautious. If you turn away—know that the duty of Our Messenger is clear communication.
93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds will not be blamed for what they may have
eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith,
then remain righteous and charitable. Allah loves the charitable.

94. Muslims,  Allah will test you with something of the game your hands and spears
obtain, that Allah may know who fears Him at heart. Whoever commits aggression after
that will have a painful punishment.

95. Muslims,  do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you
kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a domestic animal comparable to what he
killed, as determined by two honest persons among you—an offering delivered to the Kaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the consequences of his conduct.

Allah forgives what is past. But whoever repeats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is Almighty, Avenger.

96. Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and its food—as sustenance for you and for trav-
elers. But forbidden for you is the game of land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And
fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered. 

97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sa-
cred Month, and the offerings, and the garlanded. 

That you may know that Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and
that Allah is Cognizant of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution,
and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al-
lah knows what you reveal and what you con-
ceal.
100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal,
even though the abundance of the bad may
impress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you
who possess intelligence, that you may suc-
ceed.”
101. Muslims,  Do not ask about
things that would trouble you if disclosed to
you. But if you were to ask about them while
the Quran is being revealed, they will become
obvious to you. Allah forgives that. Allah is
Forgiving and Clement.
102. A people before you asked about them, but
then came to reject them.
103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of
Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but
those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al-
lah—most of them do not understand.
104. And when it is said to them, “Come to
what Allah has revealed, and to the Messen-
ger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we
found our forefathers upon.” Even if their
forefathers knew nothing, and were not
guided?
105. Muslims,  You are responsible
for your own souls. He who has strayed can-
not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is
you return, all of you, and He will inform you
of what you used to do.

106. Muslims,  When death approaches one of you, let two reliable persons from among you act as witnesses to the mak-
ing of a bequest, or two persons from another people if you are travelling in the land and the
event of death approaches you. Engage them after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them
swear by Allah: “We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if he was a near rel-
ative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testimony, for then we would be sinners.”

107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of perjury: let two others take their place, two

of us, and a sign from You; and provide for
us; You are the Best of providers.”

115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I
will punish him with a punishment the like of which I never punish any other being.”
