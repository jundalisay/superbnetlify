{{< s v="1" >}}  By the sky and the nightly visitor which is the star which has a light that pierces through the darkness. 

{{< s v="4" >}}  There is no soul without a Protector over it.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Let man consider what he was created from.
- {{< s v="6-7" >}} He was created from gushing liquid, coming from between the backbone and the breastbones.

{{< s v="8" >}} Allah is certainly able to return him to life.

{{< s v="9" >}} On the Day when the secrets are disclosed, {{< s v="10" >}} man will have no strength, and no supporter.

{{< s v="11" >}} By the sky that rains and the earth that cracks open, that Day is decisive and is not a joke. 

{{< s v="15" >}} They are preparing a plan, but I am also preparing a plan. 

{{< s v="17" >}} Therefore, give the blasphemers some time. Do not be in haste for revenge, for you will see what will become of
them.



## 87. The Most High (al-aâ€™la)

{{< s v="2" >}}  Allah creates and regulates.

{{< s v="3" >}}  He who measures and guides.{{< s v="4" >}}  He who produces the pasture.{{< s v="5" >}}  And then turns it into light debris.

6. We will make you read, so do not forget.

7. Except what Allah wills. He knows what is declared, and what is hidden.

8. We will ease you into the Easy Way.

{{< s v="9" >}}  So remind, if reminding helps. 

{{< s v="10" >}}  The reverent will remember.

{{< s v="11-13" >}}  But the wretched will avoid it.
- He will enter the Gigantic Fire where he will neither die, nor live.

{{< s v="14-15" >}} Successful is he who:
- purifies himself
- mentions the name of his Lord, and
- prays. 

{{< s v="16-18" >}} But you prefer the worldly life even if the Hereafter is better, and more lasting. This is in the former scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
