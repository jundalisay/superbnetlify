I swear by:
- the Day of Resurrection.
- the blaming soul.

Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones?
{{< s v="4" >}}  Yes, We are Able to reconstruct his fingertips.
{{< s v="5" >}}  But man wants to deny what is ahead of him.
6. He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrection?”

7. When vision is dazzled.
8. And the moon is eclipsed.
And the sun and the moon are joined together.{{< s v="10" >}}  On that Day, man will say, “Where is the
escape?”{{< s v="11" >}}  No indeed! There is no refuge.
12. To your
Lord on that Day is the settlement.
that Day man will be informed of eve-
rything he put forward, and everything he left
behind.
13. On
14. And man will be evidence against himself.
15. Even as he presents his excuses.
{{< s v="16" >}}Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry

on that Day will be radiant.
23. Looking
towards their Lord.
24. And
faces on that Day will be gloomy.
Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen
them.
26. Indeed, when it has reached the breast-
bones.
25.
27. And it is said, “Who is the healer?”
28. And He realizes that it is the parting.
29. And leg is entwined with leg.
30. To your Lord on that Day is the drive.
31. He neither believed nor prayed.
32. But
he denied and turned away.
33. Then
34. Woe
he went to his family, full of pride.
to you; and woe.
35. Then
again: Woe to you; and woe.
man think that he will be left without
purpose?
36. Does
37. Was
he not a drop of ejaculated semen?
38. Then he became a clot. And He created and
proportioned?
And made of him the two sexes, the male
and the female?
39.
40. Is He not Able to revive the dead?
