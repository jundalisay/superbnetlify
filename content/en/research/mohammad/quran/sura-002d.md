{{< s v="87">}} We :
- gave Moses the Scripture, and
- sent a succession of messengers after him
- gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs
- supported Jesus with the Holy Spirit. 

Whenever a messenger comes to you with anything that your souls do not want, you:
- grow arrogant
- call some impostors, and
- kill the others.

{{< s v="88">}} The Jews said that they hearts are sealed. Rather, Allah has cursed them for their ingratitude. They have little faith.

{{< s v="89">}} Previously, the Jews were seeking victory against those who disbelieved. 
- A scripture came to them from Allah, confirming what they have.
- But <!-- when there came to them what they recognized, --> they disbelieved in it. 
<!-- So Allah’s curse is upon the disbelievers. -->
- {{< s v="90">}} They rejected it because they resented the fact that Allah could send down His grace on whomever He chooses. 
<!-- 90. Miserable is what they sold their souls for—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of  -->

<!-- Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers. -->
<!-- And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” --> 

The Jews believe in what was revealed to them. But they reject anything beyond that. <!-- , although it is the truth which confirms what they have.  -->

Ask them: “Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you were believers?”

{{< s v="92-93" >}} Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you were wrong.

We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: “Take what We have given you firmly, and listen.” 

They said, “We hear and disobey.” 

But they loved the calf [Hinduism?] because of their disbelief. 

<!-- Say: “Wretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers.” -->


{{< s v="94-96" >}} Tell them: “If the Final Home with Allah is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.”
- But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded. 
- You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the polytheists [Hindus?]. 
- Every one of them wishes to live 1,000 years. 
  - But long life will not nudge him from the punishment.


{{< s v="97" >}} Tell them: "Gabriel revealed the Quran to your heart by Allah’s permission. The Quran:
- confirmed what preceded it
- is guidance and good news for the believers."

{{< s v="98" >}} “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel is hostile to Allah, His angels, His messengers, and Michael."

<!-- 99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners. -->

{{< s v="100" >}} Whenever the Jews make a covenant, some of them toss it aside. 
- In fact, most of them do not believe.
- {{< s v="101" >}} <!-- And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what they had, --> A faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they do not know.
- {{< s v="102" >}} They followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. 
  - Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils. 

Witchcraft was revealed in Babylon to the 2 angels Harut and Marut.
- Those 2 angels only teach those who:
  - know that witchcraft is a test and
  - do not misuse withcraft.
- But the Jews 
  - learned from those 2 how to cause separation between man and his wife
  - taught the people that witchcraft.

But the Jews:
- cannot harm anyone except with Allah's permission. 
- learned what would harm them.
- knew that whoever deals in withcraft will have no share in the Hereafter. 

They sold their souls for misery. 

{{< s v="103" >}} Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from Allah would have been better.

{{< s v="104" >}} Muslims, do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen.
- {{< s v="106" >}} We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one better or similar to it.
- {{< s v="108" >}} Do you want to demand a miracle from your Messenger as Moses was demanded a miracle before? 

{{< s v="105" >}} The disbelieving Jews, Christians, and polytheists do not want any good to be sent down to you from your Lord.
<!-- Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path. -->
- {{< s v="109" >}} They wish to turn you back into unbelievers out of envy after the Truth has become clear to them. 
- But pardon and overlook, until Allah brings His command.

<!-- 110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. 
Whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of everything you do. -->

{{< s v="111" >}} They say: “Only Jews or Christians will enter Heaven.” 
- Reply: “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”

{{< s v="113" >}} The Jews say: “The Christians are not based on anything”
- The Christians say, “The Jews are not based on anything.” 
<!-- 112. Anyone who submits himself to Allah, and does good, will have his reward with his Lord.  -->
- Yet they both read the Scripture. 
- The ignorant said the same thing. 
- Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.

{{< s v="114" >}} The most unjust are those who forbid the remembrance of Allah’s name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? 
- They should not enter them except in fear. 
<!-- For them is disgrace in this world, and for them
is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.
 -->
- {{< s v="114" >}} Allah is everywhere. Whichever way you turn, there is Allah’s presence. 

{{< s v="116" >}} The Christians say: “Allah has begotten a son.” 
- Allah is more glorified than that. 
  - Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs and is obedient to Him.
  - {{< s v="117" >}} He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. 
  - Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, “Be,” and it becomes.

{{< s v="118-119" >}} The ignorant say: “Why does Allah not speak to us, or give us a sign?” 
- We have made the signs clear for people who are certain in faith.
<!-- Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike.  -->

{{< s v="120-121" >}}  <!-- We have sent you with the truth—bringing good news, and giving warnings. You will
not be questioned about the inmates of Hell. --> The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their creed.
- Just reply to them: “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.”
- If you follow them after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have in Allah neither guardian nor helper.

<!-- {{< s v="121" >}} Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be followed--these believe in it. But as for those who reject
it—these are the losers. -->

{{< s v="122" >}} O Jews:
- remember My blessing on you, and that I have favored you over all people.
- {{< s v="123" >}} beware of a Day when:
  - no soul will avail another soul in any way,
  - no ransom will be accepted from it,
  - no intercession will benefit it, and
  - they will not be helped.
