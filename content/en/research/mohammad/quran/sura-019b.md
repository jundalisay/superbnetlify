## Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

<!-- 41. And mention in the Scripture Abraham. He was a man of truth, a prophet. -->


42. Abraham said to his father:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
“Why do you worship what can neither hear, nor see, nor benefit you in any way? There has come to me knowledge that never came to you. So follow me, and I will guide you. Do not worship the devil who is disobedient to the Most Gracious.

I fear that a punishment from the Most Gracious will afflict you, and you become an ally of the devil.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Father-of-Abraham" >}}
46. Are you renouncing my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will stone you. So leave me alone for a while.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
47. Peace be upon you. I will ask my Lord to forgive you; He has been Kind to me.

48. And I will withdraw from you, and from what you pray to instead of Allah. And I will
pray to my Lord, and I hope I will not be disappointed in my prayer to my Lord.”
{{< /l >}}


49. When he withdrew from them, and from what they worship besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob. And each We made a prophet.

<!-- 50. And We gave them freely of Our mercy, and gave them a noble reputation of truth. -->

## Moses

51. And mention in the Scripture Moses. He was dedicated. He was a messenger and a prophet. 

52. And We called him from the right side of the Mount, and brought him near in communion.

53. And We granted him, out of Our mercy, his brother Aaron, a prophet.


## Ishmael

54. Ishmael was true to his promise, and was a messenger, a prophet.

55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.


## Enoch

56. Enoch was a man of truth, a prophet. We raised him to a high position.


58. These are some of the prophets Allah has blessed from:
- the descendants of Adam
- those We carried with Noah
- the descendants of Abraham and Israel
- those We guided and selected. 

<!-- Whenever the revelations of the Most Gracious are recited to them, they would fall down, prostrating and weeping. -->

59. But they were succeeded by generations who lost the prayers and followed their appetites. They will meet perdition.

<!-- 60. Except for those who repent, and believe,
and act righteously. These will enter Paradise,
and will not be wronged in the least.

61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the
Most Merciful to His servants in the Unseen.
His promise will certainly come true.
62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but
only peace. And they will have their provision
therein, morning and evening.

63. Such is Paradise which We will give as inheritance to those of Our servants who are devout.

64. “We do not descend except by the command of your Lord. His is what is before us,
and what is behind us, and what is between
them. Your Lord is never forgetful.”

65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. So worship Him, and perse-
vere in His service. Do you know of anyone equal to Him?
66. And the human being says, “When I am dead, will I be brought back alive?”
67. Does the human being not remember that We created him before, when he was nothing?

68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and the devils, then We will bring them around
Hell, on their knees.

69. Then, out of every sect, We will snatch those most defiant to the Most Merciful.
70. We are fully aware of those most deserving
to scorch in it.

71. There is not one of you but will go down to
it. This has been an unavoidable decree of
your Lord.

72. Then We will rescue those who were devout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their knees.

73. When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who
believe, “Which of the two parties is better in position, and superior in influence?”
74. How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who surpassed them in
riches and splendor?

75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merciful will lead him on.” Until, when they see
what they were promised—either the punishment, or the Hour. Then they will know who
was in worse position and weaker in forces.

76. Allah increases in guidance those who accept guidance. And the things that endure—
the righteous deeds—have the best reward with your Lord, and the best outcome.
77. Have you seen him who denied Our revelations, and said, “I will be given wealth and
children”?

78. Did he look into the future, or did he receive a promise from the Most Merciful?
79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and
will keep extending the agony for him.
80. Then We will inherit from him what he
speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.
81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods,
to be for them a source of strength.

82. By no means! They will reject their worship of them, and become opponents to them.
83. Have you not considered how We dispatch the devils against the disbelievers, exciting
them with incitement?

84. So do not hurry against them. We are counting for them a countdown.
85. On the Day when We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful, as guests.
86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals to water.
They will have no power of intercession, except for someone who has an agreement
with the Most Merciful. -->

88. The Christians say: “The Most Merciful has begotten a son.”

89. You have come up with something monstrous that will cause the heavens to almost rupture, the earth to split, and the mountains to fall and
crumble all because they attribute a son to the Most Merciful.

92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to have a son.
- He can have servants. 
<!-- 93. There is none in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Most Merciful as a servant. -->
- 94. He has enumerated them, and counted them one by one.

<!-- 95. And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.
96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds, the Most Merciful will give them love.
97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order to deliver good news to the righteous, and to
warn with it a hostile people.

98. How many a generation have We destroyed before them? Can you feel a single one of them, or hear from them the slightest
whisper?
