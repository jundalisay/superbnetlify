{{< s v="159" >}} Among the people of Moses is a community that guides by truth, and thereby does justice.

160. We divided them into 12 tribes. The people asked Moses for something to drink and so We told him to strike the rock with your staff.

Whereupon 12 springs gushed from it. Each group recognized its drinking-place. 

We:
- shaded them with clouds
- sent down on them manna and quails: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” 
<!-- They did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong their own selves. -->
- 161. said to them:
  - “Settle this town, 
  - eat therein whatever you wish
  - speak modestly
  - enter the gate in humility—We will forgive your sins, and will promote the righteous."


162. But the wicked among them substituted other words. So We sent down on them a plague from the sky. 

In his absence, the people of Moses adopted a calf made from their ornaments— a body which lowed. 

Did they not see that it could not speak to them, nor guide them in any way? 

149. Then, when they regretted, and realized that they had erred, they said, “Unless our Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives us, we will be among the losers.”

150. When Moses returned, he was angry and disappointed. He said:

“What an awful thing you did in my absence. Did you forsake the commandments of your Lord so hastily?” 

He:
- threw down the tablets
- took hold of his brother’s head, dragging him towards himself. 

He said:

“Son of my mother, the people have overpowered me, and were about to kill me; so do not allow the enemies to gloat over me, and do not count
me among the unjust people.”

“My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”

152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred wrath from their Lord, and humiliation in this life. We thus requite the innovators.

153. As for those who commit sins, and then repent afterwards and believe. 


154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took up the tablets. In their transcript is guidance and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.

155. And Moses chose from his people 70 men for Our appointment. When the tremor
shook them, he said, “My Lord, had You willed, You could have destroyed them be-
fore, and me too. Will you destroy us for what
the fools among us have done? 

This is but Your test—with it You misguide whomever
You will, and guide whomever You will. 

You are our Protector, so forgive us, and have
mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”

156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this world, and in the Hereafter. We have turned
to You.” He said, “My punishment—I inflict

148. what We have given you, and remember what
it contains, so that you may be saved.”

172. And when Your Lord summoned the descendants of Adam, and made them testify
about themselves. “Am I not your Lord?”

They said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un-
aware of this.”

173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced idolatry before; and we are their descendants
who came after them; will you destroy us for what the falsifiers did?”

174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that they may return.

175. And relate to them the story of him to whom We delivered Our signs, but he detached himself from them, so Satan went after him, and he became one of the perverts.

176. Had We willed, We could have elevated him through them; but he clung to the
ground, and followed his desires. His metaphor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants;
and if you leave it alone, it pants. 

Such is the metaphor of the people who deny Our signs.

So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.



177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who reject Our signs and wrong themselves.

178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. And whomever He sends astray—these are
the losers.

179. We have destined for Hell multitudes of jinn and humans. They have hearts with
which they do not understand. They have eyes with which they do not see. They have
ears with which they do not hear. 

These are like cattle. In fact, they are further astray.
These are the heedless.

180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names, so call Him by them, and disregard those who blaspheme His names. They will be repaid for what they used to do.

181. Among those We created is a community—they guide by truth, and do justice thereby.

163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when they violated the Sabbath. When they observed the Sabbath, their fish would come to them abundantly. 

But when they violated the Sabbath, their fish would not come to them.
Thus We tried them because they disobeyed.

164. And when a group of them said, “Why do you counsel a people whom Allah will annihilate, or punish with a severe punishment?”
They said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so that they may become righteous.”

165. Then, when they neglected what they were reminded of, We saved those who prohibited
evil, and We seized those who did wrong with a terrible punishment, because of their sinfulness.

166. Then, when they rebelled against the commands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des-
picable apes.”

167. Your Lord has announced that, He would send against them, until the Day of Resurrection, those who would inflict terrible suffering upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribution, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.

168. And We scattered them into communities on earth. Some of them righteous, and some of them short of that. And We tested them with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they may return.

169. They were succeeded by generations who inherited the Scripture and chose the materi-
als of this world, saying, “We will be forgiven.” 

And should similar materials come their way, they would again seize them. Did
they not make a covenant to uphold the Scripture, and to not say about Allah except
the truth? Did they not study its contents?

But the Home of the Hereafter is better for the cautious; will you not understand?

170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and practice prayer—We will not waste the reward of the reformers.

171. And when We suspended the mountain over them, as if it was an umbrella, and they
thought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to


<!-- 182. As for those who reject Our messages, We will gradually lead them from where they do not know. -->

<!-- 183. And I will encourage them. My plan is firm. -->

184. The Prophet Mohammad is not crazy. He is but a plain warner.

<!-- 185. Have they not observed the government of the heavens and the earth, and all the things that Allah created, and that their time may have drawn near? Which message, besides this, will they believe in?

186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide.

And He leaves them blundering in their transgression. -->

187. They ask you about the Hour, “When will it come?” Say, “Knowledge of it rests with my Lord. None can reveal its coming except He.

It weighs heavily on the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly.” 

They ask you as if you are responsible for it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Allah,”

188. Say, “I have no control over any benefit or harm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I
known the future, I would have acquired much good, and no harm would have
touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald of good news to a people who believe.”

189. It is He who created you from a single person, and made from it its mate, that he may find comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a light load, and she carries it around. 

But when she has grown heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You give us a good child, we will be among the thankful.”

190. But when He has given them a good child, they attribute partners to Him in what He has given them. Allah is exalted above what they associate.

191. Do they idolize those who create nothing, and are themselves created? 

192. And can neither help them, nor help their own selves?

And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you, whether you invite them, or remain silent.

194. Those you call upon besides Allah are servants like you. So call upon them, and let
them answer you, if you are truthful.

195. Do they have feet with which they walk?

Or do they have hands with which they strike? Or do they have eyes with which they
see? 

Or do they have ears with which they hear? 

Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot against me, and do not wait.”

196. “My Master is Allah, He Who sent down the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”

197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot help you, nor can they help themselves.

198. And if you call them to guidance, they will not hear. And you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.

199. Be tolerant, and command decency, and avoid the ignorant.

200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails you, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing and Knowing.

201. Those who are righteous—when an impulse from Satan strikes them, they remind themselves, and immediately see clearly.

202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly into error, and they never stop short.

203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord.” These are insights from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people who believe.

204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and pay attention, so that you may experience mercy.

205. And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the morning and the evening, and do not be of the neglectful.
206. Those who are in the presence of your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They
