{{< s v="69" >}} Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger are blessed by Allah. 

They are together with:
- the prophets
- the sincere,
- the martyrs, and
- the upright. 

Excellent are those as companions.

<!-- 70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices
as Knower. -->


{{< s v="71" >}} Take your precautions
- Mobilize in groups or mobilize altogether.

{{< s v="72" >}} Among you is he who lags behind. Then, when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah has favored me, that I was not martyred with them.”

{{< s v="73" >}} But when some bounty from Allah comes to you, he says—as if no affection existed between you and him—“If only I had been with them, I would have achieved a great victory.”

{{< s v="74" >}} Let those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah.

Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and then is killed, or achieves victory, We will grant him a great compensation.

{{< s v="75" >}} Why would you not fight in the cause of Allah, and the helpless men, and women, and children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are oppressive, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Protector, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Victor.”

{{< s v="76" >}} Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.

{{< s v="77" >}} Have you not considered those who were told, “Restrain your hands, and perform your prayers, and spend in regular charity”? But when fighting was ordained for them, a faction of them feared the people as Allah is ought to be feared, or even more. 

They said, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting for us? If only You would postpone it for us for a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better for the righteous, and you will not be wronged one bit.”


{{< s v="78" >}} Wherever you may be, death will catch up with you, even if you were in fortified towers.
When a good fortune comes their way, they say, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor-
tune befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the
matter with these people, that they hardly understand a thing?

{{< s v="79" >}} Whatever good happens to you is from Allah, and whatever bad happens to you is from
your own self. We sent you to humanity as a messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.

{{< s v="80" >}} Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying Allah. 
- Whoever turns away, We did not send the Messenger for them.

{{< s v="81" >}} They profess obedience.
- But when they leave your presence, some of them conspire something contrary to what you said. 
- But Allah writes down what they conspire. 
- So avoid them, and put your trust in Allah.

{{< s v="82" >}} Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it been from any other than Allah, they would
have found in it much discrepancy. 


{{< s v="83" >}}  When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.

{{< s v="84" >}}  So fight in the cause of Allah.
- You are responsible only for yourself.
- Rouse the believers. 
- Perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. <!-- Allah is Stronger in
Might, and More Punishing. -->

{{< s v="85" >}}  Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it. 

Whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. 
<!-- Allah keeps watch over everything. -->


{{< s v="86" >}} When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. 

<!-- Allah keeps count of everything. -->

{{< s v="87" >}}  Allah will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. <!-- And who speaks more truly than Allah? -->
