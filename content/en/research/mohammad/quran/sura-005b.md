description: "O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying for you much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and overlooking much. A light from Allah has come to you, and a clear Book."
---


{{< s v="14" >}} We received the pledge of the Christians. 
- But they neglected some of what they were reminded of.
- So We provoked enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection; 

Allah will then inform them of what they used to craft.

{{< s v="15" >}} Christians, our Messenger has come to you:
- clarifying much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and
- overlooking much. 

A light from Allah has come to you, and a clear Book.

<!-- {{< s v="16" >}} Allah guides with it whoever follows His approval to the ways of peace.
- He brings them out of darkness into light, by His permission
- He guides them in a straight path. -->

{{< s v="16-17" >}} Muslims do not believe that Allah is the Christ, the son of Mary.

Allah can annihilate the Christ son of Mary, his mother, and everyone on earth.

<!-- To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and Allah has power over everything. -->

{{< s v="18" >}} The Jews and the Christians say, “We are the children of Allah, and His beloved.” 

Reply to them: “Why then does He punish you for your sins?” 

In fact, you are humans from among those He created. 

<!-- He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah
belongs the dominion of the heavens and the
earth and what lies between them, and to
Him is the return. -->


{{< s v="19" >}} Christians, our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you after a cessation of messengers. You cannot say, “No preacher, no warner, has come to us.” 

<!-- In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner --> <!-- and Allah is Capable of
everything. -->

{{< s v="20-21" >}} Moses said to his people:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Remember Allah’s blessings upon you when He:
- placed prophets among you,
- made you kings, and 
- gave you what He never gave any other people.

Enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned for you. Do not turn back, lest you return as losers.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Moses, there are tyrannical people in it. We will not enter it until they leave.
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="23" >}}  Two men of those who feared, but whom Allah had blessed, said, “Go at them by the gate; and when you have entered it, you will prevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are believers.”

{{< s v="24-26" >}}  They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you and your Lord, and fight. We are staying right here.”

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord! I have control only over myself and my brother. So please separate between us and between the wicked people.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Allah" >}}
It is forbidden for them for 40 years. They will wander aimlessly in the land. So do not grieve over the defiant people.”
{{< /r >}}


## Cain and Abel

{{< s v="27-2" >}} Tell them the true story of Adam's two sons Cain and Abel.

Both made an offering. But only Abel's was accepted. Abel said:

{{< r a="Abel" >}}
I will kill you Cain, because Allah accepts only from the righteous.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Cain" >}} 
If you try to kill me, I will not try to kill you, for I fear Allah. I would rather you bear my sin and your sin, and you become among the inmates of the Fire.
{{< /l >}} 

{{< s v="30" >}} Then Cain's soul prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him and became one of the losers.

Then Allah sent a raven digging the ground, to show him how to cover his brother's corpse. He said:

{{< l a="Cain" >}} 
Woe to me! I was unable to be like this raven and bury my brother's corpse.
{{< /l >}} 

So he became full of regrets.

{{< s v="32" >}} Because of that, We ordained for Jews that whoever kills a person unless it is for murder or corruption, it is as if he killed all of mankind. Whoever saves it, saves all of mankind. 

Our messengers came to them with clarifications. But even after that, many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.

{{< s v="33" >}}  The punishment for those who fight Allah and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they will be:
- killed
- crucified
- have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, or
- be banished from the land.

That is to disgrace them in this life. In the Hereafter, they will have a terrible punishment {{< s v="34" >}} except for those who repent before you apprehend them.

<!-- {{< s v="35" >}} Be conscious of Allah, and seek the means of approach to Him, and strive in His cause, so that you may succeed. -->

{{< s v="36" >}} As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them. For them is a painful punishment.

{{< s v="37" >}} They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a lasting punishment.

{{< s v="38" >}} Cut the hands of the thief, whether male or female, as a penalty--a deterrent from Allah. 
- {{< s v="39" >}} But whoever repents and reforms after his crime, Allah will forgive. 

<!-- {{< s v="40" >}} Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He  -->

{{< s v="41" >}} O Messenger! Do not let those who are quick to disbelief grieve you, 
- They say they believe but their hearts do not believe

The Jews are listeners to lies<!-- , listeners to other people who did not come to you.  -->
- They distort words from their places.
- They say: “If you are given this, accept it. But if you are not given it, beware.” 

<!-- Whomever Allah has willed to divert, you have nothing for him from Allah.  -->

Allah does not intend to purify their hearts.
- They are a disgrace in this world.
- There is a great punishment for them in the Hereafter.


{{< s v="42" >}} Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit earnings. 
- If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. 

If you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between
them equitably. Allah loves the equitable. 

{{< s v="43" >}} But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s Law? 

Yet they turn away after that. These are not believers.


{{< s v="44" >}} We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light. The submissive prophets
ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rabbis and the scholars, as they were required to protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it.

So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My revelations for a cheap price.
Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers.

{{< s v="45" >}} We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for
an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him.

Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers.

{{< s v="46" >}} In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, fulfilling the Torah.
- We gave him the Gospel, with its guidance and light, confirming the Torah that preceded him. 


{{< s v="47" >}} So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what Allah revealed in it. Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealedare the sinners.

{{< s v="48" >}}  We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded it, and superseding it. 

So judge between them according to what Allah revealed. 
- Do not follow their desires if they differ from that truth. 

For each of you We have assigned a law and a method. 
- Had Allah willed, He could have made you a single nation.
- But He tests you through what He has given you. 
- So compete in righteousness. 

To Allah is your return, all of you. 
- Then He will inform you of what you had disputed.


{{< s v="49" >}} Judge between them according to what Allah revealed, and do not follow their desires. 

Beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. 

But if they turn away, know that Allah intends to strike them with some of their sins. In fact, a great many people are
corrupt. 

{{< s v="50" >}} Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? 

Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?


{{< s v="51" >}} Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies.
- Some of them are allies of one another. 
- Whoever of you allies himself with them is one of them. 
- Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.


{{< s v="52" >}} You will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them. 

They say, “We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us.” 

But perhaps Allah will bring about victory, or some event of His making; thereupon they will regret what they concealed within themselves.

{{< s v="53" >}} Those who believe will say, “Are these the ones who swore by Allah with their strongest
oaths that they are with you?” 

Their works have failed, so they became losers. 

<!-- punishes whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Capable of everything. -->

Muslims,  Whoever of you goesback on his religion—Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with the disbelievers. 

They strive in the way of Allah, and do not fear the blame of the critic. 
<!-- That is the grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever He wills.  -->
