<!-- Everything in the heavens and the earth
praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise. -->

{{< s v="1" >}}  Muslims,  Why do you say what you do not do?

{{< s v="3" >}}  It is most hateful to Allah that you say what you do not do.{{< s v="4" >}}  Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in ranks, as though they were a compact structure.

{{< s v="5" >}}  When Moses said to his people, “O my people, why do you hurt me, although you know
that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And when they swerved, Allah swerved their
hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.

6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Jews, I am Allah’s Messenger to you,
confirming what preceded me of the Torah, and announcing good news of a messenger
who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad.” But when he showed them the mira-
cles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”

7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he
is being invited to Islam? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.

8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with their mouths; but Allah will complete His
Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.

{{< s v="9" >}}  It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, to make it
prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike it.
{{< s v="10" >}}  Muslims,  Shall I inform you of a trade that will save you from a painful torment?
{{< s v="11" >}}  That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your
possessions and yourselves. That is best for you, if you only knew.
12. He will forgive you your sins; and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers
flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme success.

13. And something else you love: support from Allah, and imminent victory. So give good news to the believers.

14. Be supporters of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples,
“Who are my supporters towards Allah?”

The disciples said, “We are Allah's supporters.” So a group of the Jews be-
lieved, while another group disbelieved. We
supported those who believed against their
foe, so they became dominant.




## 62. FRIDAY (al-Jumu’ah)

{{< s v="1" >}}  Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al-
mighty, the Wise.{{< s v="2" >}}  It is He who 

Allah sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves; reciting His revelations to them, and purifying them, and
teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; although they were in obvious error before that.

{{< s v="3" >}}  And others from them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.{{< s v="4" >}}  That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. 

{{< s v="5" >}}  The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it,
is like the donkey carrying works of literature. Miserable is the example of the people who denounce Allah’s revelations. 

Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.

6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu-
sion of the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are sincere.”
7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to what their hands have advanced. Allah knows
well the wrongdoers.

8. Say, “The death from which you flee will catch up with you; then you will be returned
to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to
do.”

{{< s v="9" >}}  Muslims,  When the call is made
for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to
the remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi-
ness. That is better for you, if you only knew.{{< s v="10" >}}  Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis-
perse through the land, and seek Allah’s
bounty, and remember Allah much, so that
you may prosper.{{< s v="11" >}}  Yet whenever they come across some busi-
ness, or some entertainment, they scramble
towards it, and leave you standing. Say,
“What is with Allah is better than entertain-
ment and business; and Allah is the Best of
providers.”


63. THE HYPOCRITES (al-Munafiqun)

{{< s v="1" >}}  When the hypocrites come to you, they say, “We bear witness that you are Allah’s Mes-
senger.” Allah knows that you are His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp-
ocrites are liars.{{< s v="2" >}}  

They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they repel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what
they do.{{< s v="3" >}}  That is because they believed, and then dis-
believed; so their hearts were sealed, and they cannot understand.{{< s v="4" >}}  When you see them, their appearance im-
presses you. And when they speak, you listen to what they say. 

They are like propped-up timber. They think every shout is aimed at
them. They are the enemy, so beware of them.
Allah condemns them; how deluded they are!{{< s v="5" >}}  And when it is said to them, “Come, the
Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for
you,” they bend their heads, and you see them
turning away arrogantly.

6. It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness
for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah does not guide the sinful people.

7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything on those who side with Allah’s Messenger,
unless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but
the hypocrites do not understand. 

8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more powerful therein will evict the weak.” But
power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger,
and the believers; but the hypocrites do not know.

{{< s v="9" >}}  Muslims,  Let neither your possessions nor your children distract you from the
remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that--these are the losers.{{< s v="10" >}}  And give from what We have provided for
you, before death approaches one of you, and
he says, “My Lord, if only You would delay
me for a short while, so that I may be charita-
ble, and be one of the righteous.”{{< s v="11" >}}  But Allah will not delay a soul when its time
has come. Allah is Informed of what you do.
