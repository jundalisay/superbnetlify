{{< s v="43" >}} Do not approach the prayer:
- while you are drunk, so that you know what you say
- after sexual orgasm—unless you are travelling—until you have bathed. 

If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had
intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it.


{{< s v="44-45" >}} Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They buy error, and wish you would lose the way.

<!-- {{< s v="45" >}} But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi-
cient as a Supporter. -->

{{< s v="46" >}} Some Jews take words out of context and say:
- “We hear and disobey”
- “We hear without listening”

They twist with their tongues and slander the religion. 

It would have been better for them to say "We hear and we obey. Please listen and give us your attention."
- But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief. They only believe a little.


{{< s v="47" >}} O Jews<!-- you who were given the Book -->! <!-- Believe in what We sent down before --> We obliterate faces and turn them inside out, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. 
- The command of Allah is always done.
<!-- It confirms what you have -->

{{< s v="48" >}} Allah does not forgive any association with Him. 
- But He forgives anything less than that to whomever He wills. 
- Whoever associates anything with Allah has devised a monstrous sin.

{{< s v="49-50" >}} Those how claim purity for themselves devise lies against Allah. 
- That alone is an outright sin.
<!-- - Rather, Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged a whit. -->


{{< s v="51" >}} Those who were given a share of the Book:
- believe in superstition and evil powers
- say of those who disbelieve, “These are better guided on the way than the believers.”

{{< s v="52" >}} Allah has cursed them. Whomever Allah curses has no savior.

{{< s v="53" >}} Or do they own a share of the kingdom? Then they would not give people a speck.

{{< s v="54" >}} Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His grace? 

We have given the Book and wisdom to Abraham's family.
- We have given them a great kingdom.

{{< s v="55-57" >}} Among them are those who believed in it, and among them are those who held back from it.

<!-- {{< s v="56" >}} We will scorch those who reject Our revelations. 
- Every time their skins are cooked, We will replace them with other skins, so they will experience the suffering. -->

<!-- {{< s v="57" >}} Those who believe and do good deeds We will admit into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. 
- They will have purified spouses therein -->
<!-- and We will admit them into a shady shade. -->



{{< s v="58" >}} Allah instructs you to give back things entrusted to you to their owners. 

When you judge between people, judge with justice. <!-- Al-lah’s instructions to you are excellent.  -->

{{< s v="59" >}} <!-- Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. --> If you dispute over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger<!-- if you believe in Allah and the Last Day -->. 

<!-- That is best, and a most excellent determination. -->

{{< s v="60" >}} Some claim to believe in what was revealed to you<!-- , and in what was revealed before you -->. 
- Yet they seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of being commanded to reject them. 
- Satan means to mislead them far away.

{{< s v="61" >}} Such hypocrites shun you completely when you say to them: “Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger”

{{< s v="62" >}} Disaster strikes them <!-- because what their hands have put forward, --> and then they come to you swearing by Allah: “We only intended goodwill and reconciliation”.

{{< s v="63" >}} <!-- They are those whom Allah knows what is in their hearts. --> So ignore them and admonish them. <!-- , and say to them concerning themselves penetrating words. -->

{{< s v="64" >}} We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by Allah’s leave. 

Allah would have been Relenting and Merciful had they, when they wronged themselves:
- come to you
- prayed for Allah's forgiveness
- the Messenger had prayed for their forgiveness.

{{< s v="65" >}} But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they call you to arbitrate in their disputes, and then find within themselves no resentment regarding your decisions, and submit themselves completely.

{{< s v="66" >}} Had We decreed for them: “Kill yourselves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. 

But had they done what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them, and a firmer confirmation.

{{< s v="67" >}} We would have given them from Our presence a rich compensation.

{{< s v="68" >}} We would have guided them on a straight path.
