84. Shuaib said to his brothers the Median: 

“O my people, worship Allah; Do not short measure or short weight. I see you in good circumstances, but I fear for you the agony of
an encompassing Day.”

85. “O my people! Give full measure and full weight, in all fairness, and do not cheat the
people out of their rights, and do not spread corruption in the land.

86. What is left by Allah is best for you, if you are believers. And I am not a guardian over you.”

87. They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer command you that we abandon what our ancestors worshiped, or doing with our wealth
what we want? You are the one who is intelligent and wise.”

88. He said, “O my people, What if I have clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me good livelihood from Himself? I have no desire to do what I forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but reform, as far as I can. 

My success lies only with Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I turn.”

89. “O my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you to suffer what was suffered by the people of Noah, or the people of
Hud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot are not far away from you.”

90. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and repent to Him.”

91. They said, “O Shuaib, we do not understand much of what you say, and we see that you are weak among us. Were it not for your tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of no value to us.”

92. He said, “O my people, is my tribe more important to you than Allah? And you have turned your backs on Him? ”

93. “O my people, do as you may, and so will I. You will know to whom will come a punishment that will shame him, and who is a liar.
So look out; I am on the lookout with you.”


94. And when Our command came, We saved Shuaib and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us, and the Blast struck the
wrongdoers, and they became motionless bodies in their homes.

95. As though they never flourished therein. Away with Median, as was done away with
Thamood.

96. And We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear mandate.
97. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the
command of Pharaoh was not wise.

98. He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them into the
Fire. Miserable is the place he placed them in.

99. They were followed by a curse in this, and on the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the
path they followed.

100. These are of the reports of the towns—We relate them to you. Some are still standing,
and some have withered away.

101. We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked besides Allah, availed them nothing when the command of your Lord arrived. In fact, they added only to their ruin.

102. Such is the grip of your Lord when He seizes the towns in the midst of their sins. His
grip is most painful, most severe.

103. In that is a sign for whoever fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for
which humanity will be gathered together—
that is a Day to be witnessed.

104. We only postpone it until a predetermined time.

On the Day when it arrives, no soul will speak without His permission. Some will be
miserable, and some will be happy.

106. As for those who are miserable, they will be in the Fire. They will have therein sighing
and wailing.

107. Remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord
wills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.

108. And as for those who are happy, they will be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long
as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills—a reward without end.

109. So be not in doubt regarding what these people worship. They worship only as their
ancestors worshiped before. We will pay them their due in full, without any reduction.

110. We gave Moses the Scripture, but it was disputed. Were it not for a prior word from
your Lord, it would have been settled between them. They are in serious doubt con-
cerning it.

<!-- 111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in full for their deeds. He is Aware of everything
they do.

112. So be upright, as you are commanded, along with those who repented with you, and
do not transgress. He is Seeing of everything
you do. -->

113. And do not incline towards those who do wrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you will have no protectors besides Allah, and
you will not be saved. 

114. Perform the prayer:
- at the borders of the day
- during the approaches of the night.

The good deeds take away the bad deeds. 


115. Be patient. Allah will not waste the reward of the virtuous.

{{< s v="116" >}} If only there were, among the generations before you, people with wisdom, who spoke
against corruption on earth—except for the few whom We saved. 

But the wrongdoers pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, and thus became guilty.

117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns wrongfully, while their inhabitants are righteous.

118. Had your Lord willed, He could have made humanity one community, but they continue to differ.

119. Except those on whom your Lord has mercy—for that reason He created them. The Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell with jinn and humans, altogether.”

120. Everything We narrate to you of the history of the messengers is to strengthen your heart. <!-- The truth has come to you in this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the believers. -->

121-122. Tell the disbelievers: “Act according to your ability; and so will we. Wait, and we too are waiting.” 

<!-- Allah belongs the future of the heavens
and the earth, and to Him all authority goes back.
 -->
