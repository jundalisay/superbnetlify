{{< s v="1" >}}  The command of Allah has come, so do not rush it. <!-- Glory be to Him; exalted above what they associate. -->

<!-- {{< s v="2" >}}  He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command, upon whom He wills of His servants: “Give warning that there is no god but Me, and fear Me.”

{{< s v="3" >}}  He created the heavens and the earth with justice. He is exalted above the associations
they attribute. -->

{{< s v="4" >}}  He created the human being from a drop of fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.

{{< s v="5" >}}  He created the livestock for you. They;
- give you warmth and benefits
- are eaten by you
- have beauty for you when you bring them home and drive them to pasture.
- carry your loads to territory you could not have reached without great hardship. 

You ride and use for luxury the horses, mules, and the donkeys. He creates what you do not know.

<!-- {{< s v="9" >}}  It is for Allah to point out the paths, but some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He
could have guided you all.

{{< s v="10" >}}  It is He Who sends down for you from the sky water. From it is drink, and with it grows
vegetation for grazing.

{{< s v="11" >}} He produces for you grains with it, and olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for
people who think.
12. And He regulated for you the night and the
day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars
are disposed by His command. Surely in that
are signs for people who ponder.
13. And whatsoever He created for you on
earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a
sign for people who are mindful. -->

14. He made the sea to serve you, so that you may eat from it tender meat, and extract from it ornaments that you wear. 

You see the ships plowing through it, as you seek His bounties, so that you may give
thanks.

15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it
shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that
you may be guided.

{{< s v="16" >}}And landmarks. And by the stars they
guide themselves.

<!-- 17. Is He who creates like him who does not
create? Will you not take a lesson?

18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of
Allah, you will not be able to count them. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19. And Allah knows what you hide and what
you disclose.
20. Those they invoke besides Allah create
nothing, but are themselves created.
21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not
know when they will be resurrected.

22. Your God is one God. As for those who do
not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are
in denial, and they are arrogant.
23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they
conceal and what they reveal. He does not
like the arrogant.
And when it is said to them, “What has
your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of
the ancients.”

25. So let them carry their loads complete on
the Day of Resurrection, and some of the
loads of those they misguided without
knowledge. Evil is what they carry.

26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah
took their structures from the foundations,
and the roof caved in on them. The punish-
ment came at them from where they did not
perceive.

27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will
disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso-
ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?”
Those who were given knowledge will say,
“Today shame and misery are upon the dis-
believers.”

28. Those wronging their souls while the an-
gels are taking them away—they will propose
peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah
is aware of what you used to do.”
29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for-
ever. Miserable is the residence of the arrogant.

30. And it will be said to those who maintained
piety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They
will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good
in this world is goodness, and the Home of
the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful
is the residence of the pious. -->


<!-- 31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they
will have whatever they desire. 

32. Those who are in a wholesome state when
the angels take them—will say, “Peace be
upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used
to do.”

33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come
to them, or for the command of your Lord to
arrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah
did not wrong them, but they used to wrong
their own souls. -->

<!-- 34. So the evils of their deeds assailed them,
and what they used to ridicule engulfed them. -->

35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we would not have worshiped anything besides
Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor would we have prohibited anything besides
His prohibitions.” 

Those before them did likewise. 

Are the messengers responsible for anything but clear communication?

36. To every community We sent a messenger: “Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of
them Allah guided, while others deserved
misguidance. So travel through the earth, and
see what the fate of the deniers was.

37. Even though you may be concerned about
their guidance, Allah does not guide those
who misguide. And they will have no saviors.
38. And they swear by Allah with their most
solemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any-
one who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise
binding on Him, but most people do not
know.

39. To clarify for them what they differed
about, and for the faithless to know that they
were liars.

40. When We intend for something to happen,
We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.

41. Those who emigrate for Allah’s sake after
being persecuted, We will settle them in a
good place in this world; but the reward of
the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.

42. Those who endure patiently, and in their
Lord they put their trust.

43. We did not send before you except men
whom We inspired. So ask the people of
knowledge, if you do not know.

<!-- 44. With the clarifications and the scriptures.
And We revealed to you the Reminder, that
you may clarify to the people what was re-
vealed to them, and that they may reflect.

45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that
Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with
them, or that the punishment will not come
upon them from where they do not perceive?

46. Or that He will not seize them during their
activities? And they will not be able to prevent it.

47. Or that He will not seize them while in
dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.

48. Have they not observed what Allah has created? Their shadows revolve from the right
and the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink away.

49. To Allah bows down everything in the heavens and everything on earth—every liv-
ing creature, and the angels, and without being proud.

50. They fear their Lord above them, and they
do what they are commanded.

51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He
is only One God; so fear only Me.”

52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth; and to Him obedience is due
always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than
Allah?

53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah.
And when harm touches you, it is to Him that
you groan.
54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some
of you associate others with their Lord.
55. To show ingratitude for what We have
given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon
know. -->

56. The idolaters allocate, to something they do not know, a share of what We have provided
for them. 

By Allah, you will be questioned
about what you have been inventing.

57. They attribute to Allah daughters—exalted is He—and for themselves what they desire.

58. And when one of them is given news of a female infant, his face darkens, and he chokes with grief.

59. He hides from the people because of the bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in humiliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the
decision they make.


<!-- 60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
set a bad example, while Allah sets the High-
est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.

61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in-
justices, He would not leave upon it a single
creature, but He postpones them until an ap-
pointed time. Then, when their time arrives,
they will not delay it by one hour, nor will
they advance it.

62. And they attribute to Allah what they
themselves dislike, while their tongues utter
the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a
doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be
neglected.

63. By Allah, We sent messengers to commu-
nities before you, but Satan made their deeds
appear alluring to them. He is their master
today, and they will have a painful punish-
ment.

64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to
clarify for them what they differ about, and
guidance and mercy for people who believe.

65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with
which He revives the earth after its death. In
this is a sign for people who listen. -->

66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: 

We give you a drink from their bellies, from between waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing
to the drinkers.

67. And from the fruits of date-palms and grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome
food. In this is a sign for people who understand.

68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up hives in the mountains, and in the trees, andin what they construct.”

69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the pathways of your Lord, with precision. 

From their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, containing healing for the people. Surely in this is a sign for people who reflect.

<!-- 70. Allah created you; then He takes you away.
Some of you will be brought back to the worst
age, so that he will no longer know anything, -->



after having acquired knowledge. Allah is
Omniscient and Omnipotent.
71. Allah has favored some of you over others
in livelihood. Those who are favored would
not give their properties to their servants, to
the extent of making them partners in it. Will
they then renounce Allah’s blessings?

<!-- 72. Allah has given you mates from among yourselves; and has produced for you, from
your mates, children and grandchildren; and has provided you with good things. 

73. And yet they serve besides Allah what possesses no provisions for them in the heavens,
nor on earth, nor are they capable.

74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah
knows, and you do not know. -->

75. Allah cites the example of:
- a bonded slave who has no power over anything and
- someone to whom We have given plentiful provision, from which he gives secretly and
openly. 

Are they equal in comparison? 

76. Allah cites the example of 2 men:
- one of them dumb, unable to do anything, and is a burden on his master, achieving nothing good. 
- another commands justice, and is on a straight path. 

They are not equal. 

<!-- 77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens
and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only
as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al-
lah has power over everything. -->

<!-- 78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’
wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave
you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the
brains; that you may give thanks. -->

79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the midst of the sky? None sustains them except
Allah. In this are signs for people who believe.

80. And Allah has given you in your homes habitats for you, and has provided for you out of the hides of livestock portable homes for you, so you can use them when you travel, and when you camp; and from their wool, and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort for a while.

<!-- 81. Allah has made for you shade out of
what He has created, and has given you re-
sorts in the mountains, and has given you
garments to protect you from the heat, and
garments to protect you from your violence.
Thus He completes His blessings upon you,
so that you may submit. -->

82. But if they turn away, your only duty is clear communication.

83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then deny it, as most of them are ungrateful.

84. On the Day when We raise up a witness from every community—those who disbelieved will not be permitted, nor will they be
excused.

85. When those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor
will they be reprieved.

86. And when the idolaters see their associates, they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ-
ates whom we used to invoke besides You.”

They will strike back at them with the saying,
“Surely you are liars.”

87. On that Day they will offer their submission to Allah, and what they had invented will
abandon them.

88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from
Allah’s path—We will add punishment to
their punishment, on account of the mischief
they used to make.

89. On the Day when We raise in every community a witness against them, from among
them, and bring you as a witness against these. 

We have revealed to you the Book, as an explanation of all things, and guidance,
and mercy and good news for those who submit.
