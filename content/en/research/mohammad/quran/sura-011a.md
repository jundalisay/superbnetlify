<!-- Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses
were perfected, then elaborated, from One
who is Wise and Informed. -->
{{< s v="2" >}} That you shall worship none but Allah. “Iam a warner to you from Him, and a bearer of good news.”
{{< s v="3" >}}  “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
pent to Him. He will provide you with good
sustenance until a stated term, and will be-
stow His grace on every possessor of virtue.
But if you turn away, then I fear for you the
punishment of a grievous Day.”{{< s v="4" >}}  “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable
of all things.”
{{< s v="5" >}}  They wrap their chests to hide from Him.

But even as they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows what they conceal and
what they reveal. He knows what lies within the hearts.

6. There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance depends on Allah. And He knows
where it lives and where it rests. Everything is in a Clear Book.

7. It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days—and His Throne was upon
the waters—in order to test you—which of you is best in conduct. And if you were to say,
“You will be resurrected after death,” those who disbelieve would say, “This is nothing
but plain witchcraft.”

8. And if We postponed their punishment un-
til a stated time, they would say, “What holds
it back?” On the Day when it reaches them, it
will not be averted from them, and what they
used to ridicule will besiege them.{{< s v="9" >}}  If We give the human being a taste of mercy
from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he
becomes despairing and ungrateful.{{< s v="10" >}}  And if We give him a taste of prosperity,
after some adversity has afflicted him, he will
say, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He
becomes excited and proud.{{< s v="11" >}}  Except those who are patient and do good
deeds—these will have forgiveness and a
great reward.

12. Perhaps you wish to disregard some of what is revealed to you, and you may be
stressed because of it, since they say, “If only a treasure was sent down to him, or an angel
came with him.” You are only a warner, and Allah is Responsible for all things.

13. Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say, “Then produce ten chapters like it, invented,
and call upon whomever you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful.”

14. But if they fail to answer you, know that it was revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and
that there is no god but He. Will you then submit?

15. Whoever desires the worldly life and its glitter—We will fully recompense them for
their deeds therein, and therein they will not be defrauded.

{{< s v="16" >}}These—they will have nothing but the Fire in the Hereafter. Their deeds are in vain
therein, and their works are null.

17. Is he who possesses a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and be-
fore it the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy? 

These believe in it. But whoever defies it from among the various factions, the Fire is
his promise. So have no doubt about it. 

It is the truth from your Lord, but most people do
not believe.

18. Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies about Allah? These will be pre-
sented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, “These are they who lied about their
Lord.” 

19. Those who hinder others from the path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked; and regarding the Hereafter, they are in denial.

20. These will not escape on earth, and they have no protectors besides Allah. The pun-
ishment will be doubled for them. They have failed to hear, and they have failed to see.

21. Those are the ones who lost their souls, and what they had invented has strayed away from them. 

22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will be the biggest losers.

23. As for those who believe and do good deeds, and humble themselves before their
Lord—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, where they will abide forever.

24. The parable of the two groups is that of the blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Will you not reflect?

25. We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you a clear warner.”

26. “That you shall worship none but Allah. I fear for you the agony of a painful Day.”

27. The notables who disbelieved among his people said, “We see in you nothing but a man like us, and we see that only the worst among us have followed you, those of immature judgment. And we see that you have no advantage over us. In fact, we think you are liars.”

28. He said, “O my people, Have you considered? If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from
Himself, but you were blind to it, can we compel you to accept it, even though you dislike it?”

29. “O my people! I ask of you no money for it. My reward lies only with Allah. And I am not about to dismiss those who believed; they will surely meet their Lord. And I see that you are ignorant people.”

30. “O my people! Who will support me against Allah, if I dismiss them? Will you not
give a thought?”

31. “I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor
do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that Al-
lah will never give them any good. Allah is Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I
would be one of the wrongdoers.”

32. They said, “O Noah, you have argued with us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.”

33. He said, “It is Allah who will bring it upon you, if He wills, and you will not be able to escape.”

34. “My advice will not benefit you, much as I may want to advise you, if Allah desires to confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him
you will be returned.”

35. Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “If I made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am
innocent of the crimes you commit.”
36. And it was revealed to Noah: “None of
your people will believe, except those who
have already believed, so do not grieve over
what they do.”

37. “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and with Our inspiration, and do not address Me
regarding those who did wrong; they are to be drowned.”

38. As he was building the ark, whenever some of his people passed by him, they ridiculed
him. He said, “If you ridicule us, we will ridicule you, just as you ridicule.”

39. “You will surely know upon whom will come a torment that will abase him, and upon whom will fall a lasting torment.”
40. Until, when Our command came, and the volcano erupted, We said, “Board into it a
pair of every kind, and your family—except those against whom the sentence has already
been passed—and those who have believed.”

But those who believed with him were only a few.

41. He said, “Embark in it. In the name of Allah shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My
Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”

42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves like hills. And Noah called to his son, who
had kept away, “O my son! Embark with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.”

43. He said, “I will take refuge on a mountain—it will protect me from the water.” He
said, “There is no protection from Allah’s decree today, except for him on whom He has
mercy.” And the waves surged between them, and he was among the drowned.

44. And it was said, “O earth, swallow your waters,” and “O heaven, clear up.” And the wa-
ters receded, and the event was concluded,
and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed:
“Away with the wicked people.”

45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, “O My Lord, my son is of my family, and Your
promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the wise.”

46. He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family. It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me
about something you know nothing about. I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.”

47. He said, “O My Lord, I seek refuge with You, from asking You about what I have no knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”

48. It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace from Us; and with blessings upon you, and
upon communities from those with you. And other communities We will grant prosperity,
and then a painful torment from Us will befall them.”

49. These are some stories from the past that we reveal to you. Neither you, nor your peo-
ple knew them before this. So be patient. The future belongs to the pious.

50. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O my people, worship Allah, you have no other
god besides Him. You do nothing but invent lies.”

51. “O my people, I ask you no wage for it; my wage lies with Him who originated me. Do
you not understand?”

52. “O my people, ask forgiveness from your Lord, and repent to Him. He will release the
sky pouring down upon you, and will add strength to your strength. And do not turn
away and be wicked.”

53. They said, “O Hud, you did not bring us any evidence, and we are not about to aban-
don our gods at your word, and we are not believers in you.”

54. “We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah
to witness, and you to witness, that I am innocent of what you associate.

55. Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of you, and do not hesitate.

56. I have placed my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a creature but He
holds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a straight path.

57. If you turn away, I have conveyed to you what I was sent to you with; and my Lord will replace you with another people, and you will not cause Him any harm. My Lord is Guardian over all things.”

58. And when Our decree came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, and We delivered them from
a harsh punishment.

59. That was Aad; they denied the signs of their Lord, and defied His messengers, and
followed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.

60. And they were pursued by a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. In-
deed, Aad blasphemed against their Lord—so away with Aad, the people of Hud.

61. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. 

He said, “O my people, worship Allah, you have no god other than Him. He initiated you from the earth, and settled you in it. So seek His forgiveness, and repent to Him. My Lord is Near and Responsive.”

62. They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you before this. Are you trying to prevent us from worshiping what our parents worship? 

We are in serious doubt regarding what you are calling us to.”

63. He said, “O my people, If I stand upon clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, who would protect me from Allah, if I disobeyed Him? You add nothing for me except loss.”

64. “O my people, this is the she-camel of Al-
lah, a sign for you. Let her graze on Allah’s
land, and do not harm her, lest an imminent
punishment overtakes you.”

65. But they hamstrung her, and so He said, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three
days. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”

66. Then, when Our command came, We saved Saleh and those who believed with him,
by a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.

67. And the Scream struck those who transgressed, and they became motionless bodies
in their homes.

68. As if they had never prospered therein. Thamood rejected their Lord, so away with Thamood.

69. Our messengers came to Abraham with good news. They said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted
calf.

70. But when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he became suspicious of them,
and conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do not fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.”

71. His wife was standing by, so she laughed. And We gave her good news of Isaac; and after Isaac, Jacob.
72. She said, “Alas for me. Shall I give birth, when I am an old woman, and this, my hus-
band, is an old man? This is truly a strange thing.”

73. They said, “Do you marvel at the decree of Allah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are
upon you, O people of the house. He is Praiseworthy and Glorious.”

74. When Abraham's fear subsided, and the good news had reached him, he started pleading with Us concerning the people of Lot.

75. Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.

“O Abraham, refrain from this. The command of your Lord has come; they have incurred an irreversible punishment.”

77. And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was anxious for them, and concerned for them.
He said, “This is a dreadful day.”

78. And his people came rushing towards him—they were in the habit of committing
sins. He said, “O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Al-
lah, and do not embarrass me before my guests. Is there not one reasonable man
among you?”

79. They said, “You know well that we have no right to your daughters, and you know well
what we want.”

80. He said, “If only I had the strength to stop you, or could rely on some strong support.”

81. They said, “O Lot, we are the envoys of your Lord; they will not reach you. So set out
with your family during the cover of the night, and let none of you look back, except
for your wife. She will be struck by what will strike them. Their appointed time is the
morning. Is not the morning near?”

82. And when Our command came about, We turned it upside down, and We rained down
on it stones of baked clay.

83. Marked from your Lord, and never far from the wrongdoers.
