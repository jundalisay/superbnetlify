{{< s v="1" >}}  When the sun is rolled up.{{< s v="2" >}}  When the stars are dimmed.

{{< s v="3" >}}  When the mountains are set in motion.

{{< s v="4" >}}  When the relationships are suspended.

{{< s v="5" >}}  When the beasts are gathered.

6. When the oceans are set aflame.
7. When the souls are paired.
8. When the girl, buried alive, is asked:
what crime was she killed?{{< s v="10" >}}  When the records are made public.{{< s v="11" >}}  When the sky is peeled away.
12. When the Fire is set ablaze.
13. When Paradise is brought near.
14. Each soul will know what it has readied.
15-{{< s v="16" >}}I swear by the galaxies precisely running their courses.
17. And by the night as it recedes.
18. And by the morn as it breathes.
19. This is the speech of a noble messenger.

Endowed with power, eminent with the Lord of the Throne.

And He does not withhold knowledge of
the Unseen.

## 82. THE SHATTERING (al-Infitar)

{{< s v="1" >}} When:
- the planets are scattered 
- the oceans are exploded.
- the tombs are strewn around.

Each soul will know what it has advanced, and what it has deferred.

6. O man! What deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?

7. He Who created you, and formed you, and proportioned you?

8. In whatever shape He willed, He assembled you.

{{< s v="9" >}}  But you reject the religion.{{< s v="10" >}}  Though over you are watchers and honest recorders that know everything you do.. 
The virtuous will be in bliss.

14. While the wicked will be in Hell. They will enter it on the Day of Justice. They will not be absent from it.

But what will convey to you what the Day of Justice is?

18. Then again, what will convey to you what
the Day of Justice is?

19. It is the Day when no soul will avail another soul anything. The decision on that Day is Allah’s.
