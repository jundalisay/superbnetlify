<!-- 100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on the Day of Resurrection a burden.
101. Abiding therein forever. And wretched is
their burden on the Day of Resurrection. -->

{{< s v="102" >}} On the Day when the Trumpet is blown—We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.

{{< s v="103" >}} Murmuring among themselves: “You have lingered only for ten.”

{{< s v="104" >}} We are fully aware of what they say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct will
say, “You have lingered only a day.”

{{< s v="105" >}} They ask you about the mountains. Say, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”

{{< s v="106" >}} Leave them desolate waste.

will see in them neither crookedness, nor deviation.”

108. On that Day, they will follow the caller, without any deviation. Voices will be hushed
before the Merciful, and you will hear nothing but murmur.

109. On that Day, intercession will not avail, except for him permitted by the Merciful, and whose words He has approved.

110. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend Him in their knowledge.

111. Faces will be humbled before the Living, the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will despair.

112. But whoever has done righteous deeds, while being a believer—will fear neither injustice, nor grievance.

113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, and We have diversified the warnings in it, that perhaps they would become righteous, or it may produce a lesson for them.

114. <!-- Exalted is Allah, the True King. --> Do not be hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to
you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”

<!-- 107. You And We covenanted with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no resolve.

{{< s v="116" >}} When We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” They bowed down, except
for Satan; he refused.

117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him make you
leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.

118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be naked.

119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you swelter.”
120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor-
tality, and a kingdom that never decays?”

121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their bodies became visible to them, and they
started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord,
and fell.

122. But then his Lord recalled him, and pardoned him, and guided him.

123. He said, “Go down from it, altogether; some of you enemies of some others. But
whenever guidance comes to you from Me, 
whoever follows My guidance, will not go
astray, nor suffer.

124. But whoever turns away from My Reminder, for him is a confined life. And We
will raise him on the Day of Resurrection
blind.”

125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise me blind, though I was seeing?”

126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came to you, and you forgot them, today you will
be forgotten.”

127. Thus We recompense him who trans-
gresses and does not believe in the revelations
of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and more lasting.

128. Is it not instructive to them, how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose settlements they walk? Surely in that
are signs for people of understanding.

129. Were it not for a word that issued from
your Lord, the inevitable would have hap-
pened, but there is an appointed term.

130. So bear patiently what they say, and celebrate the praises of your Lord before the ris-
ing of the sun, and before its setting. And during the hours of the night glorify Him,
and at the borders of the day, that you may be satisfied.

131. And do not extend your glance towards
what We have given some classes of them to
enjoy—the splendor of the life of this world—
that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s
provision is better, and more lasting. -->

<!-- 132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa-
tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste-
nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good
ending is that for righteousness. -->

<!-- 133. They say, “Why does he not bring us a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not given enough miracles in the former scriptures?

134. Had We destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we
would have followed Your revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced.”

135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You
will know who the people of the straight path
are, and who is rightly-guided.
