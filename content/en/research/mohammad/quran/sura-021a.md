{{< s v="1" >}}  Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but they turn away heedlessly.

{{< s v="2" >}}  No fresh reminder comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it playfully.

{{< s v="3" >}}  Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers confer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open-eyes?”

{{< s v="4" >}}  He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the heaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer, the Knower.”

{{< s v="5" >}}  And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, “He made it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him
bring us a sign, like those sent to the ancients.”

<!-- 6. None of the towns We destroyed before them had believed. Will they, then, believe?

7. We did not send before you except men, whom We inspired. Ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.

8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal.{{< s v="9" >}}  Then We fulfilled Our promise to them,
and We saved them together with whomever We willed, and We destroyed the extravagant. -->

{{< s v="10" >}}  We have sent down to you a Book, containing your message. Do you not understand?{{< s v="11" >}}  How many a guilty town have We crushed,
and established thereafter another people?

12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they started running away from it.
13. Do not run, but come back to your luxuries, and to your homes, that you may be questioned.

14. They said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.” This continued to be their cry, until We made them silent ashes.

{{< s v="16" >}} We did not create the sky and the earth and what is between them for amusement.

17. If We wanted amusement, We could have found it within Us, were We to do so.

18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto
you, for what you describe.

19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens and the earth. Those near Him are not too
proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.

20. They praise night and day, without ever tiring.
21. Or have they taken to themselves gods from the earth who resurrect?
22. If there were in them gods other than Allah, they would have gone to ruin. So glory be
to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what they allege.

23. He will not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.
24. Or have they taken, besides Him, other gods? Say, “Bring your proof. This is a message for those with me, and a message of those before me.” But most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away.

25. We never sent a messenger before you without inspiring him that: “There is no god but I, so worship Me.”

26. They say, “The Most Merciful has taken to himself a son.” Be He glorified; they are but honored servants.

27. They never speak before He has spoken, and they only act on His command.

28. He knows what is before them, and what is behind them; and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves; and they tremble in awe of Him.

29. And whoever of them says, “I am a god besides Him,” We will reward him with Hell. Thus We reward the wrongdoers.

30. Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were one mass, and We tore them apart? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not believe?

31. We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it sways with them, and We placed therein signposts and passages, that they may be guided.

32. And We made the sky a protected ceiling; yet they turn away from its wonders.

33. It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in an orbit.

We did not grant immortality to any human being before you. Should you die, are they then the immortal?

35. Every soul will taste death. We burden you with adversity and prosperity—a test. And to Us you will be returned.

36. When those who disbelieve see you, they treat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one who mentions your gods?” And they reject the mention of the Merciful.

37. The human being was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not seek to rush Me.

38. They say, “When will this promise come true, if you are truthful?”

39. If those who disbelieve only knew, when they cannot keep the fire off their faces and off their backs, and they will not be helped.

40. In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, and bewilder them. They will not be able to
repel it, and they will not be reprieved.

41. Messengers before you were also ridiculed, but those who jeered were surrounded by what they had ridiculed.

42. Say, “Who guards you against the Merciful by night and by day?” But they turn away from the mention of their Lord.

43. Or do they have gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot help themselves, nor will they be protected from Us.

44. We have given these enjoyments, and their ancestors, until time grew long upon them.

Do they not see how We gradually reduce the land from its extremities? Are they then the victors?

45. Say, “I am warning you through inspira-
tion.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when
they are being warned.

46. And when a breath of your Lord’s punishment touches them, they say, “Woe to us, we were truly wicked.”

47. We will set up the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will suf-
fer the least injustice. And even if it be the weight of a mustard-seed, We will bring it up.
