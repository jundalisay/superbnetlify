vigil of night is more effective, and better suited for recitation.

7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to do.
8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly.{{< s v="9" >}}  Lord of the East and the West. There is no
god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.{{< s v="10" >}}  And endure patiently what they say, and

13. And food that chokes, and a painful pun-

knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He
has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what

yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better
and generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s
forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.
