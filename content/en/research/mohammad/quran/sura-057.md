<!-- 1. Glorifying Allah is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the
Wise. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes
death, and He has power over all things. 
{{< s v="3" >}}  He is the First and the Last, and the Outer and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all things.
{{< s v="4" >}}  It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then settled over the
Throne. He knows what penetrates into the earth, and what comes out of it, and what descends from the sky, and what ascends to it.

And He is with you wherever you may be. Allah is Seeing of everything you do.
{{< s v="5" >}}  To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah all matters are referred.

6. He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night; and He knows
what the hearts contains.

7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend from what He made you inherit. Those
among you who believe and give will have a great reward.

8. What is the matter with you that you do not believe in Allah, when the Messenger calls
you to believe in your Lord, and He has received a pledge from you, if you are believers?{{< s v="9" >}}  It is He who sends down upon His servant clear revelations, to bring you out of darkness into the light.

{{< s v="10" >}}  And why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when to Allah belongs the in-
heritance of the heavens and the earth? Not equal among you are those who contributed
before the conquest, and fought. Those are higher in rank than those who contributed
afterwards, and fought. But Allah promises both a good reward. <!-- Allah is Well Experi-enced in what you do. -->
{{< s v="11" >}}  Who is he who will lend Allah a loan of
goodness, that He may double it for him, and
will have a generous reward?
12. On the Day when you see the believing
men and believing women—their light radi-
ating ahead of them, and to their right: “Good
news for you today: gardens beneath which
rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is
the great triumph.”
13. On the Day when the hypocritical men and
hypocritical women will say to those who be-
lieved, “Wait for us; let us absorb some of
your light.” It will be said, “Go back behind
you, and seek light.” A wall will be raised be-
tween them, in which is a door; within it is
mercy, and outside it is agony.
14. They will call to them, “Were we not with
you?” They will say, “Yes, but you cheated
your souls, and waited, and doubted, and be-
came deluded by wishful thinking, until the
command of Allah arrived; and arrogance
deceived you regarding Allah.”
15. “Therefore, today no ransom will be ac-
cepted from you, nor from those who disbe-
lieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your com-
panion—what an evil fate!”
{{< s v="16" >}}Is it not time for those who believe to sur-
render their hearts to the remembrance of Al-
lah, and to the truth that has come down, and
not be like those who were given the Book
previously, but time became prolonged for
them, so their hearts hardened, and many of
them are sinners?
17. Know that Allah revives the earth after its
death. We thus explain the revelations for
you, so that you may understand.
18. The charitable men and charitable women,
who have loaned Allah a loan of righteous-
ness—it will be multiplied for them, and for
them is a generous reward.
19. Those who believe in Allah and His mes-
sengers—these are the sincere and the witnesses with their Lord; they will have their re-
ward and their light. But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations—these are
the inmates of the Blaze.

20. Know that the worldly life is only play, and distraction, and glitter, and boasting among
you, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is like a rainfall that produces plants, and delights the disbelievers. But then it withers,
and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes debris. While in the Hereafter there is severe
agony, and forgiveness from Allah, and acceptance. The life of this world is nothing but
enjoyment of vanity.

21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the
earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the grace of Al-
lah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Allah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.
22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your souls, but it is in a Book, even before We
make it happen. That is easy for Allah.

23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes you, nor exult over what He has given you.
Allah does not love the proud snob.

24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to be stingy. Whoever turns away—Allah is the
Independent, the Praiseworthy.

25. We sent Our messengers with the clear
proofs, and We sent down with them the
Book and the Balance, that humanity may
uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in
which is violent force, and benefits for hu-
manity. That Allah may know who supports
Him and His messengers invisibly. Allah is
Strong and Powerful.
26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab-
lished in their line Prophethood and the
Scripture. Some of them are guided, but
many of them are sinners.
27. Then We sent in their wake Our messen-
gers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary,
and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in
the hearts of those who followed him com-
passion and mercy. But as for the monasti-
cism which they invented—We did not or-
dain it for them—only to seek Allah’s ap-
proval. But they did not observe it with its
due observance. So We gave those of them
who believed their reward, but many of them
are sinful.
28. Muslims,  Fear Allah, and believe
in His Messenger: He will give you a double
portion of His mercy, and will give you a light
by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
29. That the People of the Book may know that
they have no power whatsoever over Allah’s
grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He
gives it to whomever He wills. Allah is Pos-
sessor of Great Grace.
