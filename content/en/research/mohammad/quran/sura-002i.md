{{< s v="208" >}} Muslims, enter into submission wholeheartedly. 

Do not follow the footsteps of Satan.

{{< s v="209" >}} But if you slip after the proofs have come to you, know that Allah is Powerful and Wise.

{{< s v="210" >}} Are they waiting for Allah Himself to come to them in the shadows of the clouds, together with the angels, and thus the matter is settled? 

{{< s v="211" >}} Ask the Jews how many clear signs We have given them. Whoever alters the blessing of Allah after it has come to
him—Allah is severe in retribution.

{{< s v="212" >}} Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides to whomever He wills without measure.

{{< s v="213" >}} Humanity used to be one community. 
- Then Allah sent the prophets, the Scripture and the truth, bringing good news and giving warnings to judge between people regarding their differences. 

But none differed over it except those who were given it—after the proofs had come to them—out of mutual envy between them. 

Then Allah guided those who believed to the truth they had disputed, in accordance with His will. Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.


{{< s v="214" >}} Or do you expect to enter Paradise before the example of those who came before you had reached you? Adversity and hardship
had afflicted them, and they were so shaken up, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, “When is Allah’s victory?” Indeed, Allah’s victory is near.

{{< s v="215" >}} They ask you what they should give. Say, “Whatever charity you give is for the parents, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the
poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it.

{{< s v="216" >}} Fighting is ordained for you, even though you dislike it. 
- You might dislike something while it is good for you.
- You might like something while it is bad for you.

217. They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month. Say, “Fighting during it is deplorable; but to bar others from Allah’s path,
and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its peo-
ple from it, are more deplorable with Allah.

Persecution is more serious than killing.

They will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can.
Whoever among you turns back from his religion, and dies a disbeliever—those are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life,
and in the Hereafter. 

Those are the inmates of the Fire, abiding in it forever.

218. Those who believed, and those who migrated and fought for the sake of Allah--those look forward to Allah’s mercy.

## Intoxicants and gambling

219. Intoxicants and gambling creates:
- gross sin
- some benefits for people

But their sinfulness outweighs their benefit.

People should give the surplus.


220. About this world and the next. And they
ask you about orphans. Say, “Improvement
for them is best. And if you intermix with
them, then they are your brethren.” 

<!-- Allah knows the dishonest from the honest. Had
Allah willed, He could have overburdened
you. Allah is Mighty and Wise. -->

221. Do not marry idolatresses, unless they have believed. 

A believing maid is better than an idolatress, even if you like her. And do not
marry idolaters, unless they have believed. 

A believing servant is better than an idolater, even if you like him. These call to the Fire, but
Allah calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, by His leave. 

He makes clear His communications to the people, that they may be mindful.

222. Menstruation is harmful, so keep away from women during menstruation.
- Do not approach them until they have become pure. 
- Once they have become pure, approach them in the way Allah has directed you.

223. Your women are cultivation for you. 
- So approach your cultivation whenever you like, and send ahead for yourselves. <!-- And fear Allah, and know that you will meet Him. And
give good news to the believers. -->

224. And do not allow your oaths in Allah's name to hinder you from virtue, and righteousness, and making peace between people.

225. Allah does not hold you responsible for your unintentional oaths, but He holds you responsible for your intentions. Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.

226. Those who vow abstinence from their wives must wait for four months. But if they
reconcile—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

<!-- 227. And if they resolve to divorce—Allah is Hearing and Knowing. -->
