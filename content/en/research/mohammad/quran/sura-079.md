{{< s v="1-">}} On the Day, the blast of the Horn will convulse creation


By:
- those [angels] who extract with violence
- 
2. And [by] those who remove with ease 1706
3. And [by] those who glide [as if] swimming 1707
4. And those who race each other in a race 1708
5. And those who arrange [each] matter, 1709

6. ,
7. There will follow it the subsequent [one].
8. Hearts, 1710 that Day, will tremble,
9. Their eyes 1711 humbled.
10. They are [presently] saying, "Will we indeed be returned to
[our] former state [of life]?
11. Even if we should be decayed bones?" 1712
12. They say, "That, then, would be a losing return." 1713
13. Indeed, it will be but one shout,
14. And suddenly they will be [alert] upon the earth's surface.
15. Has there reached you the story of Moses? –
16. When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of $uwŒ,

1704 An-NŒziÔŒt: The Extractors.
1705i.e., those who tear out the souls of those destined for Hell.
1706i.e., those angels who ease out the souls of those destined for Paradise.
1707Speeding to execute AllŒh's commands.
1708Racing to deliver the souls of the believers to Paradise.
1709According to AllŒh's decree.
1710Those of the disbelievers who denied the Resurrection.
1711Those of the disbelievers.
1712The disbelievers say this in ridicule of the warning.
1713i.e., "If that were so, we would not be able to escape punishment."
614S´rah 79 – an-NŒziÔŒt
JuzÕ 30
17. "Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.
18. And say to him, 'Would you [be willing to] purify yourself
19. And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?' "
20. And he showed him the greatest sign, 1714
21. But he [i.e., Pharaoh] denied and disobeyed.
22. Then he turned his back, striving [i.e., plotting]. 1715
23. And he gathered [his people] and called out
24. And said, "I am your most exalted lord."
25. So AllŒh seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and
the first [transgression]. 1716
26. Indeed in that is a lesson [i.e., warning] for whoever would
fear [AllŒh].
27. Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? He [i.e.,
AllŒh] constructed it.
28. He raised its ceiling and proportioned it.
29. And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness. 1717
30. And after that He spread the earth.
31. He extracted from it its water and its pasture,
32. And the mountains He set firmly
33. As enjoyment [i.e., provision] for you and your grazing livestock.
34. But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity 1718 –
35. The Day when man will remember that for which he strove,
36. And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see –
1714i.e., the miracle of his staff becoming a great snake.
1715An alternative meaning is "running [from the snake]."
1716i.e., for Pharaoh's setting himself up as a deity and for his previous oppression
of the people and denial of Moses.
1717i.e., created the day from within the surrounding darkness.
1718i.e., the Day of Resurrection.


37. Those who transgressed and preferred the life of the world, Hellfire will be his refuge.

40. But as for he who feared the position of his Lord 1719 and
prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination,
41. Then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge.

42. They ask you: "O Muúammad when is the Hour of its arrival?" 

You do not know it because only Allah knows. 
- You are only a warner for those who fear it.

<!-- 46. It will be, on the Day they see it, 1723 as though they had not
remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning
thereof. -->
