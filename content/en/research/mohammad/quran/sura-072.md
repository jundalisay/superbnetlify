A band of jinn listened in and said:

We have heard a wondrous Quran.
-  {{< s v="2" >}} It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it

We will never associate anyone with our Lord.
- {{< s v="3" >}} Our Lord never had a mate, nor a child.

{{< s v="4" >}} But the fools among us used to say nonsense about Allah.
- {{< s v="5" >}} We thought that humans and jinn would never utter lies about Allah.

{{< s v="6" >}} Some humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they only increased them in confusion.

{{< s v="7" >}} They thought, as you thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone.

{{< s v="8" >}} We probed the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and projectiles.
- {{< s v="9" >}}  We used to take up positions to listen in on the angels. 
- But whoever listens now finds a projectile waiting for him.

{{< s v="10" >}}  We do not know whether the Lord of those on earth intends good or bad for them.

{{< s v="11" >}}  Some of us are righteous. But some of us are not. We follow divergent paths.

{{< s v="12" >}} We realized that:
- we cannot defeat Allah on earth
- we cannot escape Him by fleeing.

{{< s v="13" >}} When we heard the Quran, we believed in it. <!-- Whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss, nor burden. -->
- {{< s v="14" >}} Some of us are submitting
  - These pursue rectitude.
- Some of us are compromisers
  - {{< s v="15" >}} The compromisers will have firewood for Hell.
  - {{< s v="16" >}} Had they kept true to the Path, We would have given them plenty water to drink {{< s v="17" >}} to test them with it. <!-- Whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will direct him to torment ever mounting. -->

{{< s v="18" >}} The places of worship are for Allah. So besides Allah, do not call on anyone else.
{{< s v="19" >}} When the Prophet Mohammad got up calling on Him, the jinn crowded on <!--   almost fell on --> him in a mass.

Mohammad, say:
- {{< s v="20" >}} “I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him.”
- {{< s v="21" >}} “It is not in my power to harm you, nor to bring you to right conduct.”
- {{< s v="22" >}} “No one can protect me from Allah, and I will not find any refuge except with Him."

{{< s v="23" >}} I only have a notification and messages from Allah. <!-- He who defies Allah and His Messenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in which they will dwell forever.” -->

{{< s v="24" >}} When they see what they were promised, the jinn will know who is weaker in helpers, and fewer in numbers.

{{< s v="25" >}} Say, “I do not know whether what you were promised is near, or whether my Lord will extend it for a period.” 

{{< s v="26" >}} Allah is the Knower of the invisible.
- He does not disclose His knowledge of the invisible to anyone, {{< s v="27" >}} except to his messengers. 
- He then dispatches guardian angels in front of and behind those messengers so that {{< s v="28" >}} the messengers may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord. <!-- He encompasses what they have, and has tallied everything by number. -->
