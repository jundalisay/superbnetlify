{{< s v="68" >}} When you encounter those who gossip about Our revelations, turn away from them, until they engage in another topic. 

But should Satan make you forget, do not sit after the recollection with the wicked people.


70. So leave alone those who take their religion for play and pastime, and whom the worldly life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a
soul becomes damned on account of what it has earned. It has no helper or intercessor besides Allah. Even if it offers every equivalent,
none will be accepted from it. 

These are the ones who are delivered to perdition by their actions. They will have a drink of scalding water, and a painful punishment, because they used to disbelieve.

71. Say, “Shall we invoke besides Allah something that can neither benefit us nor harm us,
and turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us; like someone seduced by the devils
and confused on earth, who has friends call-
ing him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” Say, “The
guidance of Allah is the guidance, and we are
commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Universe.”

72. “And to perform the prayers, and to revere
Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered.”

73. It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day when He says:
“Be,” it will be. His saying is the truth, and
His is the sovereignty on the Day when the
trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and
declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.

74. Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you take idols for gods? I see that you and your people are in evident error.”

75. Thus We showed Abraham the empire of the heavens and the earth, that he might be
one of those with certainty.

76. When the night fell over him, he saw a planet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when
it set, he said, “I do not love those that set.”

77. Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he
said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be
one of the erring people.”

78. Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, “This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it set, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of
your idolatry.

79. I have directed my attention towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth—a
monotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.” 

80. And his people argued with him. He said, “Do you argue with me about Allah, when He has guided me? I do not fear what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge.

Will you not reconsider?

81. And why should I fear those you associate with Him, and you do not fear associating
others with Allah for which He sent down to you no authority? Which side is more enti-
tled to security, if you are aware?”

82. Those who believe, and do not obscure their faith with wrongdoing—those will have
security, and they are guided.

83. That was Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We elevate by
degrees whomever We will. 

84. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob—each of them We guided. And We guided Noah
previously; and from his descendants David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Mo-
ses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the righteous.

85. Zechariah, John, Jesus, and Elias were upright.

86. We favored Ishmael, Elijah, Jonah, and Lot over all other people.

87. And of their ancestors, and their descendants, and their siblings—We chose them, and
guided them to a straight path.

<!-- 88. Such is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it
whomever He wills of His servants. Had they
associated, their deeds would have gone in
vain. -->

89. Those are they to whom We gave the Book, and wisdom, and prophethood. If these reject
them, We have entrusted them to others who do not reject them.
The righteous are in no way accountable for them; it is only a reminder, that they may be careful.


90. Those are they whom Allah has guided, so
follow their guidance. Say, “I ask of you no
compensation for it; it is just a reminder for
all mankind.”

91. They do not value Allah as He should be valued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal
anything to any human being.” Say, “Who revealed the Scripture which Moses brought—
a light and guidance for humanity?” You put it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing
much. And you were taught what you did not know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say,
“Allah;” then leave them toying away in their speculation.

92. This too is a Scripture that We revealed—blessed—verifying what preceded it, that you
may warn the Mother of Cities and all around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe
in it, and are dedicated to their prayers.

93. Who does greater wrong than someone who invents falsehood against Allah, or says,
“It was revealed to me,” when nothing was revealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of
what Allah revealed”? If only you could see the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the
angels with arms outstretched: “Give up your souls. Today you are being repaid with the torment of shame for having said about Allah other than the truth, and for being too proud to accept His revelations.”

94. “You have come to Us individually, just as We created you the first time, leaving behind
you everything We gave you. We do not see with you your intercessors—those you
claimed were your partners. The link between you is cut, and what you had asserted
has failed you.”

<!-- 95. It is Allah Who splits the grain and the seed. He brings the living from the dead, and
He brings the dead from the living. Such is Allah. So how could you deviate?
96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He
made the night for rest, and the sun and the
moon for calculation. Such is the disposition
of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
 -->

97. He created the stars for you, that you may be guided by them in the darkness of land and sea.

98. He produced you from a single person, then a repository, then a depository. 

99. He sends down water from the sky. 
- With it We produce vegetation of all kinds, from which We bring greenery, from
which We produce grains in clusters. 

And palm-trees with hanging clusters, and vine-
yards, and olives, and pomegranates—similar
and dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they
grow and ripen. Surely in this are signs for
people who believe.

100. Yet they attributed to Allah partners—the sprites—although He created them. And they
invented for Him sons and daughters, with-out any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is
exalted, beyond what they describe.

101. Originator of the heavens and the earth—how can He have a son when He never had a
companion? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.

102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god except He, the Creator of all things; so wor-
ship Him. He is responsible for everything.

103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
104. “Insights have come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his
soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its
detriment. I am not a guardian over you.”

105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they say, “You have studied,” and to clarify them
for people who know.

106. Follow what was revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn
away from the polytheists.

107. Had Allah willed, they would not have practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you as
a guardian over them, and you are not a manager over them.

108. Do not insult those they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult Allah out of hostility
and ignorance. We made attractive to every community their deeds. Then to their Lord is
their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.

109. They swear by Allah, with their most solemn oaths, that if a miracle were to come to
them, they would believe in it. Say, “The miracles are only with Allah.” But how do you
know? Even if it did come, they still would not believe.

110. And We turn away their hearts and their visions, as they refused to believe in it the first
time, and We leave them blundering in their rebellion.

111. Even if We sent down the angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered
all things before them, they still would not
believe, unless Allah wills; but most of them
are ignorant.

112. Likewise, We have assigned for every prophet an enemy—human and jinn devils—
inspiring one another with fancy words in order to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they
would not have done it. So leave them to their fabrications.

113. So that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be
content with it, and that they may perpetrate whatever they perpetrate.

<!-- 114. “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah,
when He is the One who revealed to you the
Book, explained in detail?” Those to whom
We gave the Book know that it is the truth re-
vealed from your Lord. So do not be of those
who doubt.

115. The Word of your Lord has been com-
pleted, in truth and justice. There is no
changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the
Knower.

1{{< s v="16" >}}If you were to obey most of those on earth,
they would divert you from Allah’s path.
They follow nothing but assumptions, and
they only conjecture.

117. Your Lord knows best who strays from His path, and He knows best the guided ones.
eat of that over which the Name of Allah was pronounced, if you indeed believe in
His revelations. -->

119. And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of Allah is pronounced,
when He has detailed for you what is prohibited for you, unless you are compelled by necessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, through lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows
best the transgressors.

120. So abandon sin, outward and inward. Those who commit sins will be repaid for what they used to perpetrate.

121. And do not eat from that over which the Name of Allah was not pronounced, for it is
abomination. The devils inspire their followers to argue with you; but if you obey them,
you would be polytheists.

122. Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like he who is in total darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the doings of disbelievers are made to appear good to them.

123. And thus We set up in every city its leading wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they
conspire only against themselves, and they do not realize it.

124. When a sign comes to them, they say, “We will not believe unless we are given the like of
what was given to Allah’s messengers.” <!-- Allah knows best where to place His message. Hu-
miliation from Allah and severe torment will
afflict the criminals for their scheming. -->

<!-- 125. Whomever Allah desires to guide, He spreads open his heart to Islam; and whom-
ever He desires to misguide, He makes his heart narrow, constricted, as though he were
climbing up the sky. Allah thus lays defile-
ment upon those who do not believe.
126. This is the straight path of your Lord. We
have explained the revelations in detail for
people who recollect.

127. For them is the Home of Peace with their Lord, and He is their Master—because of
what they used to do. -->

128. On the Day when He gathers them all together: “O assembly of jinn, you have ex-
ploited multitudes of humans.” 

Their adherents among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we have profited from one another, but we have
reached the term that you have assigned for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your dwelling,
wherein you will remain, except as Allah wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.

129. Thus We make some of the wrongdoers befriend one another, because of what they used to do.

130. “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there
not come to you messengers from among
you, relating to you My revelations, and
warning you of the meeting of this Day of
yours?” They will say, “We testify against
ourselves.” The life of the world seduced
them. They will testify against themselves
that they were disbelievers.
131. That is because your Lord would not de-
stroy towns for injustice while their inhabit-
ants are unaware.
132. They all have ranks according to what they
did; and your Lord is not unaware of what
they do.

<!-- 133. Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do
away with you, and substitute whomever He
wills in your place, just as He produced you
from the descendants of another people.

134. What you are promised is coming, and
you cannot thwart it. -->
