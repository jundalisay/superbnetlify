<!-- {{< s v="1" >}}  Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad A mention of the mercy of your Lord towards His servant .{{< s v="3" >}}  When he called on his Lord, a call in seclusion. -->

{{< s v="1-8" >}}  Zechariah called to the Lord in seclusion: 

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“My Lord, my bones have become feeble. My hair is gray. I have never been disappointed in my prayer to you. I fear for my dependents after me. My wife is barren. So grant me an heir from Yourself, and to inherit the House of Jacob and make him pleasing."
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
“O Zechariah, We give you good news of a son, whose name is John, a name We have
never given before."
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I am old?"
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="9" >}} 

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
“It is easy for me. I created you before, when you were nothing."
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="10" >}}

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“My Lord, give me a sign."
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Allah" >}}
“Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for 3 nights straight.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="11" >}} So he came out from the sanctuary, and sign-languaged to them to praise morning and evening.


<!-- 12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,”
and We gave him wisdom in his youth.

13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence.
He was devout.

14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a
disobedient tyrant.

15. And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is raised alive. -->

{{< s v="16" >}} Mary withdrew from her family to move to an eastern location.
<!-- - She screened herself away from them. -->
- We sent to her Our spirit which appeared to her as an immaculate human.

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
18. I take refuge from you should you be righteous.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I am only the messenger of your Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
20. How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I was never unchaste?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Man" >}}
21. Your Lord said `It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign for humanity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decided.'
{{< /r >}}


22. So she carried him, and secluded herself with him in a remote place.

23. The labor-pains came upon her, by the trunk of a palm-tree.

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
I wish I had died before this, and been completely forgotten.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Man" >}}
24-26. He called her from beneath her: “Do not worry; your Lord has placed a stream beneath you. Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you. So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if you see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast so I will not speak to any human today.'
{{< /r >}}


27. Then she came to her people, carrying the baby Jesus.


{{< r a="People" >}}
O Mary, sister of Aaron, you have done something terrible. Your father was not an evil man, and your mother was not a whore.
{{< /r >}}


29. Mary pointed to baby Jesus.

{{< r a="People" >}}
How can we speak to a baby?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
30. I am the servant of Allah. He has:
- given me the Scripture, and made me a prophet.
- made me blessed wherever I may be
- enjoined on me prayer and charity, so long as I live.

Be kind to my mother. Allah did not make me a disobedient rebel.
33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the Day I get resurrected alive.”
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 34. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt. -->

35. It is not for Allah to have a son because to have anything done, He says “Be” and it becomes.


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.
{{< /l >}}

37. But the various factions differed among themselves. <!-- So woe to those who disbelieve
from the scene of a tremendous Day.  -->
- 38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day they come to Us. <!-- But the wrongdoers today
are completely lost. -->
- 39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. Yet they are
heedless, and they do not believe.

40. It is We who will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and to Us they will be returned.
