## 92. The Night (al-layl)


{{< s v="1-3" >}}
By:
- the night,
- the day, and
- He who created male and female

{{< s v="4" >}} Your efforts have been diverse.

{{< s v="5-7" >}} Those who gives, fears Allah, and believes in the best reward, We will give him ease.

{{< s v="8-11" >}} But for he who withholds, considers himself free of need, and denies the best reward, We will ease him toward difficulty. What can his wealth avail him when he dies?

{{< s v="12" >}} Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.

13. And indeed, to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life].

14. So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing.

15. None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one

16. Who had denied and turned away.

17. But the righteous one will avoid it â€“

18. [He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself

19. And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be
rewarded 1809

20. But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High.

21. And he is going to be satisfied.



## 93. MORNING LIGHT (adh-Duha)

{{< s v="1" >}} By the morning brightness and the dark night, Your Lord has not left you oh Muhammad. Nor has He detested you.

{{< s v="4" >}} Tthe Hereafter is better for you than this life. You will be satisfied with it.

{{< s v="6" >}} You were an orphan, so He gave you refuge.

You were lost, so He guided you. 

You were poor, so He made you self-sufficient.

Rebuff the beggar, but proclaim the blessings of your Lord.
