description: "O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying for you much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and overlooking much. A light from Allah has come to you, and a clear Book."
---


<!-- 1. Praise be to , Who created the heavens
and the earth, and made the darkness and the
light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals
to their Lord. -->


{{< s v="2" >}} Allah created you from clay, then decided a term—a term determined by him. 

Yet the disbelievers doubt.

{{< s v="4" >}} <!-- 3. He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you keep secret and what you
make public; and He knows what you earn. --> Not one of their Lord’s signs comes to them, but they turn away from it.

{{< s v="5" >}} They denied the truth when it has come to them.
- But soon will reach them the news of what they used to ridicule.


6. Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them? We had
established them on earth more firmly than We established you, and We sent the clouds
pouring down abundant rain on them, and We made rivers flow beneath them. But We
destroyed them for their sins, and established other civilizations after them.

7. Had We sent down upon you a book on paper, and they had touched it with their hands,
those who disbelieve would have said, “This is nothing but plain magic.”

8. And they say, “Why was an angel not sent down to him.” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled, and they would not have been reprieved.
{{< s v="9" >}}  Had We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and confused them when they are already confused.
{{< s v="10" >}}  Messengers before you were ridiculed, but
those who mocked them became besieged by what they ridiculed.
{{< s v="11" >}}  Say, “Travel the earth and observe the final fate of the deniers.”

<!-- 12. Say, “To whom belongs what is in the heav-
ens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has
inscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather
you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls do not believe.

13. To Him belongs whatever rests in the night and the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

14. Say, “Shall I take for myself a protector other than Allah, Originator of the heavens
and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed?” 

Say, “I am instructed to be the first of those who submit.” And do not be among the idolaters.

15. Say, “I fear, should I defy my Lord, the pun-
ishment of a tremendous Day.”

{{< s v="16" >}}Whoever is spared on that Day—He had mercy on him. That is the clear victory. -->

17. If Allah touches you with adversity, none can remove it except He. And if He touches
you with good—He is Capable of everything.

18. He is the Supreme over His servants. He is the Wise, the Expert.

19. Say, “What thing is more solemn in testimony?” Say, “Allah is Witness between you
and me. 

This Quran was revealed to me, that I may warn you with it, and whomever it may
reach. Do you indeed testify that there are
other gods with Allah?” Say, “I myself do not
testify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am
innocent of your idolatry.”

20. Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children. But those who have lost their souls do not believe.

21. Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies against Allah, or denies His revelations? The wrongdoers will not succeed. 

22. On the Day when We gather them all together, then say to the idolaters, “Where are your idols, those you used to claim?”

23. Then their only argument will be to say, “By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”

24. Look how they lied to themselves. And what they invented deserted them.

25. Among them are those who listen to you; but We place covers over their hearts, to prevent them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. Until, when they come to you, to argue with you, those who
disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but myths of the ancients.”

26. They keep others from it, and avoid it themselves; but they ruin only their own souls, and they do not realize.

27. If only you could see, when they are made to stand before the Fire; they will say, “If only we could be sent back, and not reject the revelations of our Lord, and be among the faithful.”

28. What they used to conceal before will become clear to them. And even if they were sent back, they would revert to what they were forbidden. They are liars.

29. They say, “There is nothing but our life in this world, and we will not be resurrected.”

30. If only you could see, when they are stationed before their Lord. He will say, “Is this not real?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the torment for having disbelieved.”

31. Losers are those who deny the encounter with Allah. Then, when the Hour comes
upon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas for us, how we have neglected it.” And they will
carry their burdens on their backs—evil is what they carry.

32. The life of this world is nothing but game and distraction. 
- But the Home of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous.<!--  Do you not understand? -->

33. We know that what they say grieves you. It is not you they reject, but it is Allah's revela-
tions that the wicked deny.

34. Other messengers before you were rejected, but they endured rejection and perse-
cution until Our help came to them. 

There can be no change to Allah’s words. 

News of the Messengers has already reached you.

35. If you find their rejection hard to bear, then if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a stairway into the heaven, and bring them a sign. Had Allah willed, He could have gathered them to guidance. So do not be of the ignorant.

36. Only those who listen will respond. As for the dead, Allah will resurrect them; then to
Him they will be returned.

37. And they say, “If only a sign could come down to him from his Lord.” Say, “Allah is
Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.”

38. There is no animal on land, nor a bird flying with its wings, but are communities like you. We neglected nothing in the Scripture.

Then to their Lord they will be gathered.

39. Those who reject Our revelations are deaf and dumb, in total darkness. Whomever Al-
lah wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He
wills, He sets on a straight path.

<!-- 40. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun-
ishment came upon you, or the Hour over-
took you, would you call upon any other than
Allah, if you are sincere?” -->

<!-- 41. In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if
He wills, he will remove what you called Him
for, and you will forget what you idolized.

42. We sent messengers to communities be-
fore you, and We afflicted them with suffer-
ing and hardship, that they may humble
themselves.

43. If only, when Our calamity came upon
them, they humbled themselves. But their
hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds
appear good to them.

44. Then, when they disregarded what they
were reminded of, We opened for them the
gates of all things. Until, when they delighted
in what they were given, We seized them sud-
denly; and at once, they were in despair.

45. Thus the last remnant of the people who
did wrong was cut off. And praise be to Allah,
Lord of the Worlds. -->

46. Say, “Have you considered? If Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and set a
seal on your hearts, what god other than Allah would restore them to you?” Note how
We explain the revelations in various ways, yet they still turn away.

47. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's punishment descended on you suddenly or gradually, would any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?”

48. We sent the messengers only as bearers of good news and as warners. Those who believe and reform have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

49. But as for those who reject Our revelations, torment will afflict them because of their defiance.

50. Say, “I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future,
nor do I say to you that I am an angel. 

I only follow what is inspired to me.” Say, “Are the blind and the seeing alike? Do you not think?”

51. And warn with it those who fear to be gathered before their Lord—they have no protec-
tor or intercessor apart from him—perhaps they will grow in piety.

52. And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His
attention. You are not accountable for them in any way, nor are they accountable for you
in any way. 

If you drive them away, you would be one of the unjust.

53. Thus We try some of them by means of others, that they may say, “Are these the ones
whom Allah has favored from among us?” Is Allah not aware of the appreciative?

54. When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your
Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. 

Whoever among you does wrong out of ignorance, and then repents afterwards and re-
forms.

<!-- 55. Thus We explain the revelations, and expose the path of the unrighteous.

56. Say, “I am forbidden from worshiping those you pray to besides Allah.” Say, “I will
not follow your desires; else I would be lost
and not be of those guided.” -->
<!-- 
57. Say, “I stand on clear evidence from my
Lord, and you have rejected Him. I do not
possess what you seek me to hasten; the deci-
sion belongs solely to Allah. He states the
truth, and He is the Best of Judges.”

58. Say, “If I possessed what you seek me to
hasten, the matter between you and me
would have been settled. Allah is well aware
of the unjust.”

59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except He. And He knows eve-
rything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls
but He knows it; and there is not a single grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there anything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.

60. It is He Who takes you by night, and He
knows what you earn by day. Then He raises
you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled.
Then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.

61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and
He sends guardians over you, until, when
death overtakes one of you, Our envoys take
him away, and they never fail.
62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their
True Master. Unquestionably, His is the
judgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon-
ers.
63. Say, “Who delivers you from the darkness
of land and sea?” You call upon Him humbly
and inwardly: “If He delivers us from this,
We will surely be among the thankful.”
64. Say, “It is Allah who delivers you from it,
and from every disaster. Yet then you associ-
ate others with Him.”
65. Say, “He is Able to send upon you an afflic-
tion, from above you, or from under your
feet. Or He can divide you into factions, and
make you taste the violence of one another.
Note how We explain the revelations, so that
they may understand.”
66. But your people rejected it, though it is the
truth. Say, “I am not responsible for you.”
67. For every happening is a finality, and you
will surely know. -->
