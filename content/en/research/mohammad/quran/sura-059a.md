<!-- {{< s v="1" >}}  Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heavens and the earth. -->


{{< s v="2" >}}  It is He who evicted those who disbelieved among the People of the Book from their homes at the first mobilization. You did not think they would leave, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came at them from where they never expected, and threw terror into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers.

Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have insight.

{{< s v="3" >}}  Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have punished them in this life. But in
the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire.

{{< s v="4" >}}  That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah—Allah
is stern in retribution.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Whether you cut down a tree, or leave itstanding on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He
will surely disgrace the sinners.

6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His
Messenger from them; you spurred neither
horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au-
thority to His messengers over whomever He
will. Allah is Able to do all things.

7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger
from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to
Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela-
tives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and
to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate
solely between the wealthy among you.
Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it;
and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it.
And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
ment.
8. To the poor refugees who were driven out
of their homes and their possessions, as they
sought the favor of Allah and His approval,
and came to the aid of Allah and His Messen-
ger. These are the sincere.{{< s v="9" >}}  And those who, before them, had settled in
the homeland, and had accepted faith. They
love those who emigrated to them, and find
no hesitation in their hearts in helping them.
They give them priority over themselves,
even if they themselves are needy. Whoever
is protected from his natural greed—it is they
who are the successful.{{< s v="10" >}}  And those who came after them, saying,
“Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who
preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in
our hearts towards those who believe. Our
Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”{{< s v="11" >}}  Have you not considered those who act
hypocritically? They say to their brethren
who disbelieved among the People of the
Book, “If you are evicted, we will leave with
you, and will not obey anyone against you;
and should anyone fight you, we will cer-
tainly support you.” But Allah bears witness
that they are liars.
12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with
them; and if anyone fights them, they will not
support them; and if they go to their aid, they
will turn their backs and flee; then they will
receive no support.
13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts
than fear of Allah. That is because they are a
people who do not understand.
14. They will not fight you all together except
from fortified strongholds, or from behind
walls. Their hostility towards each other is se-
vere. You would think they are united, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they
are a people who do not understand.

15. Like those shortly before them. They experienced the consequences of their decisions.
For them is a painful punishment.

{{< s v="16" >}}Like the devil, when he says to the human being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe-
lieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear
Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.”

17. The ultimate end for both of them is the Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the
requital for the wrongdoers.

18. Muslims,  Fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has forwarded for
the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of what you do.
19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah,
so He made them forget themselves. These
are the sinners.
20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire
and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in-
habitants of Paradise who are the winners.
21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun-
tain, you would have seen it trembling, crum-
bling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite
for the people, so that they may reflect.
22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the
Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the
Compassionate, the Merciful.
23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god;
the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the
Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the
Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to
Allah, beyond what they associate.
24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De-
signer. His are the Most Beautiful Names.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glo-
rifies Him.
