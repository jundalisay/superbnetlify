<!-- 1. Ha, Meem. The sending down of the Scripture is from
Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.{{< s v="3" >}}  Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se-
vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty.
There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti-
mate return.
{{< s v="4" >}}  None argues against Allah’s revelations ex-
cept those who disbelieve. So do not be im-
pressed by their activities in the land. -->
{{< s v="5" >}}  Before them the people of Noah rejected the truth, as did the confederates after them.

Every community plotted against their messenger, to capture him. And they argued with falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I seized them. What a punishment it was!

6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became realized against those who disbelieve, that they
are to be inmates of the Fire. 

7. Those who carry the Throne, and those around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and
believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for those who believe: “Our Lord, You have encompassed everything in mercy and
knowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the
agony of the Blaze.

8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gardens of Eternity, which You have promised
them, and the righteous among their parents,
and their spouses, and their offspring. You
are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.

{{< s v="9" >}}  And shield them from the evil deeds. Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, on that Day, You have had mercy on him.
That is the supreme achievement.”

{{< s v="10" >}}  Those who disbelieved will be addressed, “The loathing of Allah is greater than your loathing of yourselves—for you were invited
to the faith, but you refused.”

{{< s v="11" >}}  They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we
acknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?”

12. That is because when Allah alone was called upon, you disbelieved; but when others
were associated with Him, you believed. 

13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and sends down sustenance from the sky for you.
But none pays heed except the repentant.

14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.
15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon
whomever He wills of His servants, to warn
of the Day of Encounter.
{{< s v="16" >}}The Day when they will emerge, nothing
about them will be concealed from Allah. “To
whom does the sovereignty belong today?”
“To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”
17. On that Day, every soul will be recom-
pensed for what it had earned. There will be
no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set-
tle accounts.
18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence,
when the hearts are at the throats, choking
them. The evildoers will have no intimate
friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.
19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and
what the hearts conceal.


Allah judges with justice, while those
whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge
with anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing,
the Seeing.

21. Have they not travelled through the earth,
and seen the consequences for those before
them? They were stronger than them, and
they left more impact on earth. But Allah
seized them for their sins, and they had no
defender against Allah.
22. That is because their messengers used to
come to them with clear proofs, but they dis-
believed, so Allah seized them. He is Strong,
Severe in retribution.
23. We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear
authority.
24. To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But
they said, “A lying sorcerer.”
25. Then, when he came to them with the truth
from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those
who have believed with him, and spare their
daughters.” But the scheming of the unbe-
lievers can only go astray.
26. Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kill Moses, and
let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may
change your religion, or spread disorder in
the land.”
27. Moses said, “I have sought the protection
of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant
who does not believe in the Day of Account.”
28. A believing man from Pharaoh's family,
who had concealed his faith, said, “Are you
going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is
Allah,’ and he has brought you clear proofs
from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will
rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then
some of what he promises you will befall you.
Allah does not guide the extravagant imposter.

29. O my people! Yours is the dominion today,
supreme in the land; but who will help us
against Allah’s might, should it fall upon us?”
Pharaoh said, “I do not show you except what
I see, and I do not guide you except to the
path of prudence.”

30. The one who had believed said, “O my peo-
ple, I fear for you the like of the day of the
confederates.
31. Like the fate of the people of Noah, and
Aad, and Thamood, and those after them. Al-
lah wants no injustice for the servants.
32. O my people, I fear for you the Day of Call-
ing Out.
33. The Day when you will turn and flee, hav-
ing no defender against Allah. Whomever Al-
lah misguides has no guide.”
34. Joseph had come to you with clear revela-
tions, but you continued to doubt what he
came to you with. Until, when he perished,
you said, “Allah will never send a messenger
after him.” Thus Allah leads astray the outra-
geous skeptic.
35. Those who argue against Allah’s revela-
tions, without any proof having come to
them—a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and
of those who believe. Thus Allah seals the
heart of every proud bully.
36. And Pharaoh said, “O Hamaan, build me a
tower, that I may reach the pathways.
37. The pathways of the heavens, so that I may
glance at the God of Moses; though I think he
is lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were
made to appear good to him, and he was
averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was
only in defeat.
38. The one who had believed said, “O my peo-
ple, follow me, and I will guide you to the
path of rectitude.”
39. “O my people, the life of this world is noth-
ing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter
is the Home of Permanence.
40. Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only
with its like. But whoever works righteous-
ness, whether male or female, and is a be-
liever—these will enter Paradise, where they
will be provided for without account.
41. O my people, how is it that I call you to sal-
vation, and you call me to the Fire?


42. You call me to reject Allah, and to associate
with Him what I have no knowledge of, while
I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.
43. Without a doubt, what you call me to has
no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and
our turning back is to Allah; and the trans-
gressors are the inmates of the Fire.
44. You will remember what I am telling you,
so I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Ob-
servant of the servants.”
45. So Allah protected him from the evils of
their scheming, while a terrible torment be-
sieged Pharaoh’s clan.
46. The Fire. They will be exposed to it morn-
ing and evening. And on the Day the Hour
takes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the
most intense agony.”
47. As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will
say to those who were arrogant, “We were
followers of yours; will you then spare us a
portion of the Fire?”
48. Those who were arrogant will say, “We are
all in it; Allah has judged between the serv-
ants.”
49. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers
of Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suf-
fering for one day.”
50. They will say, “Did not your messengers
come to you with clear signs?” They will say,
“Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the
prayers of the disbelievers will always be in
vain.”
51. Most surely We will support Our messen-
gers and those who believe, in this life, and on
the Day the witnesses arise.
52. The Day when their excuses will not profit
the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon
them, and they will have the Home of Misery.
53. We gave Moses guidance, and made the
Jews inherit the Scripture.
54. A guide and a reminder for those endowed
with reason.
55. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true.
And ask forgiveness for your sin, and pro-
claim the praise of your Lord evening and
morning.
56. Those who dispute regarding Allah’s reve-
lations without any authority having come to
them—there is nothing in their hearts but the
feeling of greatness, which they will never at-
tain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All-
Hearing, the All-Seeing.
57. Certainly the creation of the heavens and
the earth is greater than the creation of hu-
manity, but most people do not know.
58. Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor
are those who believe and work righteousness
equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.
59. Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no
doubt about it; but most people do not be-
lieve.
60. Your Lord has said, “Pray to Me, and I will
respond to you. But those who are too proud
to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.”
61. It is Allah Who made the night for you, that
you may rest therein; and the day allowing
sight. Allah is gracious towards the people,
but most people do not give thanks.
62. Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all
things. There is no god except Him; so how
could you turn away?
63. Thus are turned away those who dispute
the signs of Allah.
64. It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for
you, and the sky a structure. And He de-
signed you, and designed you well; and He
provided you with the good things. Such is
Allah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of
the Worlds.
65. He is the Living One. There is no god ex-
cept He. So pray to Him, devoting your reli-
gion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of
the Worlds.
66. Say, “I was prohibited from worshiping
those you invoke besides Allah, now that
clear revelations have come to me from my Lord; and I was commanded to submit to the
Lord of the Worlds.”
67. It is He who created you from dust, then
from a seed, then from an embryo, then He
brings you out as an infant, then He lets you
reach your maturity, then you become el-
derly—although some of you die sooner—so
that you may reach a predetermined age, so
that you may understand.
68. It is He who gives life and death; and when
He decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,”
and it comes to be.
69. Have you not observed those who dispute
regarding Allah's revelations, how they have
deviated?
70. Those who call the Book a lie, and what We
sent Our messengers with—they will surely
know.
71. When the yokes are around their necks,
and they will be dragged by the chains.
72. Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they
will be consumed.
73. Then it will be said to them, “Where are
those you used to deify?
74. Instead of Allah?” They will say, “They
have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying
to nothing before.” Thus Allah sends the dis-
believers astray.
75. That is because you used to rejoice on earth
in other than the truth, and because you used
to behave with vanity.
76. Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein
forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arro-
gant.
77. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true.
Whether We show you some of what We
have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us
they will be returned.
78. We sent messengers before you. Some of
them We told you about, and some We did
not tell you about. No messenger can bring a
miracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when
the command of Allah is issued, fair judg-
ment will be passed, and there and then the
seekers of vanity will lose.
79. Allah is He who created the domestic ani-
mals for you—some for you to ride, and some
you eat.
80. And in them you have other benefits as
well, and through them you satisfy your
needs. And on them, and on the ships, you
are transported.
81. And He shows you His signs. So which of
Allah’s signs will you deny?
82. Have they not journeyed through the land,
and seen the outcome for those before them?
They were more numerous than they, and
had greater power and influence in the land.
But what they had achieved availed them
nothing.
83. When their messengers came to them with
clear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge
they had, and the very things they used to rid-
icule besieged them.
84. Then, when they witnessed Our might,
they said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we
reject what we used to associate with Him.”
85. But their faith could not help them once
they witnessed Our might. This has been Al-
lah’s way of dealing with His servants. And
there and then the disbelievers lost.
