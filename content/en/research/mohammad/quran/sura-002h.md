{{< s v="190" >}} Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you. 
- But do not commit aggression.
- Allah does not love the aggressors.

{{< s v="191" >}} Kill them wherever you overtake them
- Expel them from where they had expelled you. 

Oppression is more serious than murder. 
- But do not fight them at the Kabbah unless they fight you there. 

If they fight you, then kill them. <!-- Such is the retribution of the disbelievers. -->

{{< s v="192" >}} But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

{{< s v="193" >}} Fight them until there is no oppression, and worship becomes devoted to Allah alone. 

But if they cease, then let there be no hostility except against the oppressors.


{{< s v="194" >}} The sacred month for the sacred month;

Sacrilege calls for retaliation. 

Whoever commits aggression against you, retaliate against him in the same measure as he has committed against you. 

<!-- Bbe conscious of
Allah, and know that Allah is with the right-
eous.
 -->

{{< s v="195" >}}  Spend in the cause of Allah. 
- Do not throw yourselves with your own hands into ruin
- Be charitable.

{{< s v="196" >}} Carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for Allah. 

But if you are prevented, then whatever is feasible of offerings.

Do not shave your heads until the offering has reached its destination. 

Whoever of you is sick, or has an injury of the head, then redemption of fasting, or charity, or worship. When you are se-
cure: whoever continues the Umrah until the Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. 

But if he lacks the means, then fasting for 3 days during the Hajj and 7 when you have returned, making 10 in all. 

This is for he whose household is not present at the Kabbah. 

{{< s v="197" >}} The Hajj is during specific months. 

Whoever decides to perform the Hajj—there shall be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor quarrelling during the Hajj. 

Take provisions. The best provision is righteousness.

Be mindful of Me.


198. You commit no error by seeking bounty from your Lord. 

When you disperse from Arafat, remember Allah at the Sacred Landmark. And remember Him as He has guided
you. Although, before that, you were of those astray.

199. Then disperse from where the people disperse, and ask Allah for forgiveness.

200. When you have completed your rites, remember Allah as you remember your parents, or even more. 

Among the people is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,”
yet he has no share in the Hereafter.

201. And among them is he who says, “Our Lord, give us goodness in this world, and
goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.”

202. These will have a share of what they have earned. Allah is swift in reckoning.

203. Remember Allah during the designated days. But whoever hurries on in 2 days commits no wrong, and whoever stays
on commits no wrong—provided he maintains righteousness. And obey Allah, and
know that to Him you will be gathered.

204. Among the people is he whose speech about the worldly life impresses you, and he
calls Allah to witness what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.

205. When he gains power, he strives to spread corruption on earth, destroying properties and lives. Allah does not like corruption.

206. And when he is told, “Beware of Allah,” his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is
enough for him—a dreadful abode. 

207. And among the people is he who sells himself seeking Allah’s approval. Allah is
kind towards the servants.
