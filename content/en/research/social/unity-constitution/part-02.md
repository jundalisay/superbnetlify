**Article 5: Condition**

These human rights are not available to the inhumane which will have the non-human rights instead.


**Article 6: Unity and Society** 

All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights within a society, predisposed to unity.

The existence of human society is a manifestation of this predisposition. These unified human rights, therefore, can only exist within a structure of a society. 


**Article 7: Ego and Human Limitation**

The ego, as the feeling of the self, causes disunity and all the problems in society. It hampers fellow-feeling and the development of virtue. 

Related to the ego are human sensory limitations. These lead to variations in culture, language, religion, ideologies, and mentalities. <!--  or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.  -->

<!-- No distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty. -->


**Article 8: No Slavery or Arbitrary Detention**

The ego leads to the slavery and arbitrary arrest, detention or exile of others. Thus, we guarantee that every human has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 

<!-- Slavery is prohibited, whether in physical or mental spheres.

No one shall be subjected to . -->
