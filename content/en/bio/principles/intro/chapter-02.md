According to Superphysics, everything in the universe has mind and consciousness from the Positive Force. However, their expression is limited by the Negative Force which makes them appear as lifeless. We call this a non-living thing.   

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/mind.png" cap="" >}}

A living thing, on the other hand, has a mind that can accept external feelings and ideas and likewise express them because the Negative Force is weaker. 

<!-- A non-living thing cannot, due to the confinement by the Negative Force. -->

‘Life’ therefore is an expressive mind that inhabits a physical body.

<!-- A ‘virus’ is in-between a non-living idea and a living or expressive mind, that manifests as DNA or RNA. It has to use living things to spread itself as its means of expression or action.

From the viewpoint of the Creator:

the DNA of viruses and bacteria are simple ideas
the souls of humans and cats are complex ideas.
But from the viewpoint of viruses and bacteria, they themselves are minds, just as cats and dogs are see themselves as minds (cause) and not as ideas (effect).

Likewise, we see ourselves as the cause of our own actions instead of being the effect of the Creator (working through us). -->


## How is Life Created?


The Principles of Superphysics explained that the Two Forces act together to create both physical and metaphysical existence. 

The Negative or Repressing Force crudifies the Positive or Inciting Force starting from the aethereal layer until it condenses into matter as a star. 

Further oppression from the Negative Force leads to the explosion of the stellar matter as a supernova. This spreads both material particles and aetherael life throughout the solar system.

Life therefore comes from stars just as matter does. 

Under this paradigm, there should be an abundance of life just as there is an abundance of matter in the universe. The main difference is that the manifestation of aethereal life in the physical domain requires cooperation of the rest of the 4 layers: 

4. Spatial
3. Radiant
2. Transformative
1. Material

Without these, aethereal life cannot take a physical material form. The rarity of physical life in the universe is therefore from the difficulty of getting all 5 layers aligned to support life.
