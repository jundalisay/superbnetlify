The Principles of Superphysics explained that the Two Forces act together to create physical existence. 

The Negative or Repressing Force crudifies the Positive or Inciting Force starting from the aethereal layer until it condenses into matter as a star. 

Further oppression from the Negative Force leads to the explosion of the stellar matter as a supernova. This spreads both material particles and aetherael life throughout the solar system.

Life therefore comes from stars just as matter does. 

Under this paradigm, there should be an abundance of life just as there is an abundance of matter in the universe. The main difference is that the manifestation of aethereal life in the physical domain requires cooperation of the rest of the 4 layers: 

4. Spatial
3. Radiant
2. Transformative
1. Material

Without these, aethereal life cannot take a physical material form.
