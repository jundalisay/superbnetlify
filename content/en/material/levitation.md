In a past post, we explained [Material Bands for contact forces](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03) by starting with an example of action at a distance, as levitation. This was to introduce the concept of metapyhsical Effort, as being different from the physical Force from Newton.  

Here, we explain Effort as implemented to create action-at-a-distance, something that is not known in Physics. This is  because Einstein cancelled the aether which facilitates it. 

In contrast, Superphysics enshrines the aether as the top or boss-layer of physical reality. 

This is still in line with Nature since Maxwell, Fresnell, Hertz, and Tesla all believed in the aether. It is therefore only Einstein who is out of touch with Nature. This in turn is why technology is so limited and humans still use Newtonian rockets (based on 17th century principles) to go to outer space.

## The Effort of Aether

We use the Stokes (Material) Aether to demonstrate action at a distance. 

We take a 1 kilogram object then apply a prolonged emission on it in order to reduce its weight by 1 gram. We then use this as the basis for a levitating object propelled by the aether.

This is where `G`, `g`, and the Kepler tensor will be necessary to change the state of an object in order to move it through spacetime or Descartes' aether without needing contact forces.  


## All 5 Layers Work Together to Create Physical Reality

In a nutshell, the aether used electromagnetism on a material object to change its location in spacetime. This manifests as movement which is recorded relatively by the weighing scale. 

This means that, logically, the ability to change and generate movement comes from the radioactive layer (weak force).  

Thus, the sequence of events is:

Sequence | Layer | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | Aether | The intention to move the mass
2 | Radiant (Electromagnetism) | The emission is created
3 | Material (Strong) | The emission hits the identity (object with mass)
4 | Transformative (Weak) | This creates a change in the identity
5 | Spatial (Spacetime) | This moves the object

As you can see, all 5 layers are used to create the reality of the movement of the object. This then matches our principle that all physical movement and change involves all 5 layers, ultimately commanded by the aethereal layer. 
 

<!-- Our proposed Superphysics uses the principles of the aether which were supported by great physicists like Maxwell, Fresnell, Lorentz, and Poincare before they were discarded by Einstein's Relativity.

	To demonstrate, we take a 1 kilogram weight and induce a state-change via the aether. This makes the mass 1 gram lighter, representing its repelling of the gravity of the Earth via action at a distance, without any Newtonian contact force.

	As we only use household tools such as a digital kitchen scale, we find inconsistencies in the weight change. But this is still different from having no change in the control (i.e video-record the weight-value for 10 minutes with and without the aether induction).

	From here, we can easily see how aether tech makes sense in construction. This is consistent in early civlizations which built large and heavy infrastructure, such as Egyptian pyramids, without any knowledge of electricity or even combustion. This tech only needs the discovery of fire as to create the construction tools. It doesn't even need writing technology since aether knowledge is best transmitted through oral tradition just as you can learn from YouTube videos faster than from reading a book. 

	Accordingly, we see Hindus preferring oral teachings, and the Egyptians not writing their aether technology down. Instead, the latter taught it orally to Pythagoras which taught it to his followers. Eventually it was learned by Timaeus who was recorded by Plato which we can read now online. 

	Timaeus' account of the aether is important as it must match the aether of the Hindus (akasha) who use it to propel themselves, as levitating monks, instead of for construction. This then supports the case for aethereal propulsion in vehicles. The purported round shape of UFOs match our basic concept for propelling a mass using Descates' First Rule of Movement instead of Netwon's 3rd Law used in rockets. -->
