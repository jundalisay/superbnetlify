The previous post explained the concept of [Qosts or the quantum of space time](/material/principles/qost). These are points in spacetime that gather energy to create mass in order to create discrete things. These create spacetime by their mutual repulsion and, thus, are essential in levitation and teleportation.

These can also be employed to harness energy in two ways:  

1. By tapping into the repulsion of qosts that lead to the accelerated expansion of space. This is like a windmill tapping the energy from the wind and can be classified as free energy

2. By extracting the energy from the atomic reactions of the material layer. This is how fission and fusion extracts energy. This requires an input, such as hydrogen and is therefore non-free energy. However, it extracts more energy in a shorter time. 

Physicists are going for the second approach after learning how to extract atomic energy in the 1940's through nuclear fission reactions, as a consequence of atomic theory. However, fission is limited and dangerous. This led physicists to go for fusion which is supposed to be clean and safe.

## The Fusion Solution

Fusion is done by heating hydrogen into a plasma as to create energy. In a star, this plasma is confined by a gravitational field from the star's qost. This allows the hydrogen to get compressed which creates mass which adds more gravity and consequently, more heat. This then creates fusion which releases energy as starlight and sunshine.  

Without this confinement, the star would dissipate immediately. And so, **the extreme sustained confinement and compression** is the key to fusion.

Humans try to recreate fusion by using magnetism instead of artificial gravity to confine the plasma. The problem is that magnetism uses up electrical energy in the process. This makes the input cost of outputting fusion energy very high. When added to all the cost of making the reactor and its maintenance, it can possibly lead to loss. This makes fusion-by-magnetism commercially unviable -- a sheer waste of money, time, and effort, similar to the wasteful expense for dark matter detectors which have detected nothing and will detect nothing.

Physicists think that somehow, adding more electricty will make the process more efficient.  This arises from materialist thinking:
- if you want your rocket to go farther, just add more fuel 
- if you want to win a war, just add more troops to your army

The problem is that this method only applies to the last three layers of our five layer model, specifically, the electromagnetic, radioactive, and material layers. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/egllayers.png" cap="Superphysics uses the five layers of aether, air, fire, water, and earth of the Greeks and Asians as aether, spatial, radiant, radioactive, and material, or 水, 木, 火, 土, 金, respectively" alt="5 Layers of Superphysics" >}}



It does not apply to the upper two layers of the spatial or aethereal, where crudity is replaced by precision and sophistication. The technological designs for the lower three layers are so simplistic:
- the general design of combustion-based rockets is based on a simple tube
- all air-based airplanes are a tubes with two wings 

The Spatial (gravitational layer) is different because it is based on points, and points connected with other points lead to geometries. These are then manipulated by the upper aethereal layer which is based on waves, examples of which are sounds and waves of feelings. In the aethereal layer, the points of the spatial layer manifest as discrete ideas instead of discrete objects and matter.

Historically, these geometries manifest as pyramids and pyramid blocks which must be precise as to fit perfectly like lego bricks. 


{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/objects/egypt.jpg" alt="Egyptian pyramids" cap="The ancient Egyptians knew about the principles of the spatial layer and were consequently focused on geometry" >}}


## Shape is Very Important in the Spatial Layer 

In fusion, these geometries manifest as the different shapes of the fusion reactors which represent the different ways of confining material plasma, as explained [here](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03401-w/index.html).

**1. The Donut Tokamak**

![Donut-shaped tokamak](/graphics/tokamak.jpg)

**2. The Twisty Stellarator**

![Stellarator reactor](/graphics/stellarator.jpg)

**3. The Spherical General Fusion Design**

![Spherical reactor](/graphics/gf.jpg)

**4. The Linear TAE**

![TAE reactor](/graphics/tae.jpg)


These four shapes can be categorized into two*:

1. Roundish fusion reactors (Reactors 1-3)
2. Linear fusion reactors (Reactor 4)

> *This is similar to how Social Superphysics distills the four political cycles of Liberal, Neoliberal, Conservative, and Neoconservative into two: Liberal versus Conservative


These are used by advanced alien civilizations as the basis of their UFO design:

1. Round reactors lead to spherical UFOs as flying saucers
2. Linear reactors lead to cigar shaped ones


{{< img src="/graphics/ufo.png" alt="UFO shapes" cap="All UFOs are perfectly symmetrical with simple shapes because their propulsion comes from their center of gravity. Their Physics have long abandoned Newtonian Classical mechanics" >}}



A round reactor uses a single qost (monad). This outputs less energy, but is useful for compact vehicles. 

A linear reactor uses two or more qosts (duads, etc). This outputs much more energy, and is useful for very large vehicles.

<!-- Of the current fusion designs, this is what the twisty stellarator is trying to do. However, it still needs to be overhauled as to create a vortex which will create gravity which will confine it and make it sustainable. This will allow it to be reduced in size as to be able to fit large vehicles. This vortex-stellarator can then assume either the round or linear shape:

1. The round twisty reactor is the compact version, useful for small vehicles
2. The linear twisty version is for large vehicles -->


{{< img src="/images/phoenix.jpg" alt="V-shaped UFO" cap="The large 'Phoenix' UFO uses two linear reactors shaped as a V, giving it much more power than a saucer or cigar UFO. This eliminates the need for 'wormholes' for going into the 'other side of the universe' or to 'other dimensions" >}}



It's clear that alien civilizations have figured out how to harness fusion. If the smallest ship is 7 meters in diameter then its round fusion reactor should be small enough to fit inside a bus, unlike the current reactor designs which occupy whole buildings.  



So what is missing in the human version?


## Artificial Gravitation is Missing 

The main problem is that physicists haven't discovered the underlying principles for gravitation. 


Currently, this is supposed to be done by Einstein's General Relativity (GR)*. However, upon closer inspection of [his theory](/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity), it's clear that GR is merely Special Relativity (SR) applied to cosmic objects. 


**It is a theory of light applied to outerspace. It is not a theory of gravity!**

The proof is the necessity of light to prove GR:

- gravitational waves are detected by LIGO which uses light-based lasers
- gravitational lensing is detected by light from other stars

> *The blame for the dominance of Einstein's GR really falls on Lorentz who was not able to properly defend the concept of the all-pervading aether (which now is called the Higgs field)  












The problem is that SR is based on the principles of electromagnetism, which is the lower layer under gravitation (spatial layer). This leads to absurd concepts like a singularity that defies physics. 

The predictions of GR are only true for whatever is **visible** in the universe. It doesn't apply to invisible things, such as dark matter, actual black holes, and the **relationships** between different cosmic objects. 

Take away light and Einstein's General Relativity fails! The problem is that the visible universe is a very very small part of physical reality. GR has no opinion on other dimensions or multiverses and so quantum physics messes around with quack theories like Penrose's CCC.

Hindu and Buddhist monks have figured out all the five layers of the universe and that's why they came up with a policy of  denouncing physical reality. Instead of immersing in the material world, they focus on the highest aethereal layer which is pure metaphysics. A side-effect of this is having *siddhas* or supernatural powers. They are only "supernatural" because the human definition of the "natural" world is the universe that lies in the three lower layers:

1. Electromagnetic (eletromagnetic force)
2. Transformative (weak force)
3. Material (strong force)

One of these powers is to levitate using their center of gravity. 

{{< youtube ufORgD0s2Mo >}}

This shows how low energy input as metaphysical Effort*, without any physical fuel source or physical Force, can produce "work" as to physically lift a man by altering his [gravitational signature](/material/fallacies/general-relativity). 

> *This concept is one of the basis for our [Effort Theory of Value](/social/economics/principles/effort-theory-of-value), derived from Adam Smith, and is the foundation of Supereconomics. It is opposite of the 'scarcity' embraced by Economics which makes it into a dismal science. 


This is the same technique used by UFO's to lift themselves without needing boosters nor bulky fuel tanks. It implies that their ships are sentient* just as the monk is sentient or has his own ability to express metaphysical ideas and do effort by himself.

> *This is why artificial sentience is one of the main goals of Superphysics


<!-- This is the first power-generation method that we mentioned being simiar to windmills.   -->

Fusion is thus created when a sentient computer manipulates the gravitational signature of hydrogen, as deuterium, as to both confine and levitate them. This is the same thing that stars ([stellar qosts](/material/principles/qost)) naturally do to clouds of gas and dust in a galaxy to start fusion and actually become stars*.


> *This implies that stars are sentient. This sentience is [the origin of life](/medical/physical/solutions/covid-flu-star) in the universe and is the connection point between Material and Bio Superphysics



This system does not need an external fuel source or large amounts of external energy, making it very long lasting and sustainable. In fact, stars use it to give free energy* for billions of years until it runs out of gas, literally. 

<!-- This can be applied to fusion as the alternate way to confine plasma as to create high energy output using very low energy input by using gravity to both levitate and confine the plasma which starts out  or hydorgen. --> 

<!-- , can be added to make this power-generation system output more energy to power entire civilizations.  -->

In fact, magnetism plays a very negligible role in this type of fusion because if a UFO's reactor were mostly magnetized then it would be left behind whenever the UFO teleported to another location! 

<!-- In the gravitational method, the plasma itself creates the gravitational field by creating a vortex in the center. This is similar to a pyramid that uses its tip as the vortex for the Earth, like an antenna.  -->


## So how do we get there?

Since artificial gravitation is the key ingredient to sustainable fusion, the first step is to actually levitate things without using electricity. This was done by:
- the ancient Egyptians to lift pyramid blocks 
- the Israelites* who used trumpets to amplify the gravitation of the walls of Jericho as to make them collapse

> *The Israelites came from Egypt, so their scientists, who were called priests or rabbi, would have some idea of how the gravity tech of the Egyptians worked. <!-- Nowadays, scientists  -->


The use of trumpets by the Israelites is consistent with Kepler who wrote about the Harmony of the Universe, consistent with Socrates and Pythagoras:


{{< q a='kepler' >}}
a great distinction exists between the consonances of the single planets which have been unfolded and the consonances of the planets in pairs. The single ones cannot exist at the same moment, but the pairs absolutely can. This is because the same planet, moving at its aphelion, cannot be at the opposite perihelion at the same time. But of two planets, one can be at its aphelion and the other at its perihelion. <br><br>And so the ratio of plain-song or monody, which we call "choral music" and which alone was known to the ancients, 1 to polyphony—called "figured song,"; 2 the invention of the latest generations—is the same as the ratio of the consonances which the single planets designate to the consonances of the planets taken together.

Therefore, musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul.

Material Superphysics builds on Kepler's Laws to rebuild the principles of the material Universe based on sound from the perspective of the Supreme Entity instead of the shallow human view based on sight. This bypasses everything from Aristotle to Ptolemy, and Newton to Einstein, who created Physics principles from a shallow observation of cause and effect:



Materialist Camp | Nonmaterialist Camp
--- | ---
Aristotle, Ptolemy (Earth is the center) | Aristarchus, Copernicus (the sun is the center)
Newton, Einstein (Mass creates gravity) | Kepler, Galileo (Gravity is from the foci* of two objects)


> *Material Superphysics develops Kepler's foci concept into qosts

So the steps towards sustainable fusion are:

1. Levitate something (like a pyramid block) without electricity in order to derive principles (formulas)
2. Apply those principles to metals to find the geometry for their vortex point, as an artificial qost
3. Use that geometry to tap reliable but low power spacetime energy 
4. Pool that energy to create plasma
5. Make that plasma flow* to create a more serious vortex to confine itself gravitationally, leading to sustained fusion

> *The TAE reactor has this idea, but because it has no concept of gravitation, it has no choice but to raise the plasma to extreme heat, making the whole thing wasteful



## Mini FAQ

1. How are you so sure that magnetic fusion won't work eventually after it's scaled it up?

Because the principles of electromagnetism are the same for the small and large scale. It is the principles of gravitation that is affected by scale. A small qost that has a little data to output will have slightly different dynamics from a supermassive qost that has a lot of data to churn. 

An electron (qoe) merely reflects the data that already exists. This is different from a qost that actually creates data which really comes from its underlying aether. 


2. Einstein already disproved the aether, right?

No. Einstein merely cited the experiment of Michelson and Morley which detected no **material** aether in space that was supposed to create aether-drag. But this is because they didn't know that the "Fire" aether is bound or limited by the spatial layer.

The proper way to "discover" the fire-aether is to measure the speed of light:
- at very "far" times at the same space (like our Earth) or
- at very "far" spaces (such as from Earth and from Alpha Centauri) at the same time . 

This leads to different measurements of the speed of light. These differences then represent the aether-drag. 

<!-- The "Earth aether" was later detected as the Higgs boson which proved the existence of a Higgs field that gave mass to particles. We equate the Higgs field as the Stokes Aether.  -->

<!-- In the sequence of creation in Superphysics, data starts in the aethereal layer. This then is coursed through the spatial layer through qosts which turn the data into physical reality through qosts (gravitons in Physics) which manifest as stars and other gravitational objects. These objects combine the preexisting energy with the data from the aether in order to create particles that have mass and emit the data as photons, sounds, tactility, etc.  -->

![Michelson](/graphics/physics/michelson.png)

<!-- Thus, aether cannot be measured by electromagnetism just as you cannot shine a physical light on ideas or souls to see them. 

Instead, it follows the dynamics described by Hinduism, Taoism, Timaeus, and Descartes.
