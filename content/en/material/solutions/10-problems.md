Modern Physics is currently stuck with [10 problems](https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/01/good-problems-in-foundations-of-physics.html), which we classify below:



<!-- Grand Unification
	 Sabine Hossenfelder
A lot of physicists would rather have one unified force in the standard model rather than three different ones. There is, however, nothing wrong with the three different forces. I am undecided as to whether the almost-prediction of the Weinberg-angle from breaking a large symmetry group does or does not require an explanation.

Quantum Gravity
Quantum gravity removes an inconsistency and hence a solution to a good problem. However, I must add that there may be other ways to resolve the problem besides quantizing gravity.

Black Hole Information Loss
A good problem in principle. Unfortunately, there are many different ways to fix the problem and no way to experimentally distinguish between them. So while it’s a good problem, I don’t consider it a promising research direction.

Particle Masses
It would be nice to have a way to derive the masses of the particles in the standard model from a theory with fewer parameters, but there is nothing wrong with these masses just being what they are. Thus, not a good problem.

Quantum Field Theory
There are various problems with quantum field theories where we lack a good understanding of how the theory works and that require a solution. The UV Landau pole in the standard model is one of them. It must be resolved somehow, but just exactly how is not clear. We also do not have a good understanding of the non-perturbative formulation of the theory and the infrared behavior turns out to be not as well understood as we thought only years ago (see eg here).

The Measurement Problem
The measurement problem in quantum mechanics is typically thought of as a problem of interpretation and then left to philosophers to discuss. I think that’s a mistake; it is an actual inconsistency. The inconsistency comes from the need to postulate the behavior of macroscopic objects when that behavior should instead follow from the theory of the constituents. The measurement postulate, hence, is inconsistent with reductionism.

The Flatness Problem
Is an argument from finetuning and not well-defined without a probability distribution. There is nothing wrong with the (initial value of) the curvature density just being what it is. Thus, not a good problem.

The Monopole Problem
That’s the question why we haven’t seen magnetic monopoles. It is quite plausibly solved by them not existing. Also not a good problem.

Baryon Asymmetry and The Horizon Problem
These are both finetuning problems that rely on the choice of an initial condition, which is considered to be likely. However, there is no way to quantify how likely the initial condition is, so the problem is not well-defined.

The Strong CP Problem
Is a naturalness problem, like the Hierarchy problem, and not a problem of inconsistency. -->



## Gravity Problems

**1. Quantum Gravity**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity and Newton
- Solution: [Aethereal Vortices](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-01b/)


**5-6. Dark Energy and Dark Matter**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity
- Solution: [Spatial Layer](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-02/), Quanta of Spacetime, and Aethereal Vortices

![Aether](/graphics/physics/aethertech.png)


**6.5 Strong CP Problem**


- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: [The 5 Layers](/material/principles/intro/chapter-01/), specifically the Spatial and Material Layers

<!-- Why is the cosmological constant small compared to the powers of the Planck mass?
the absence of observable fluctuations around the vacuum energy (what Afshordi calls the “cosmological non-constant problem”) and the question why the zero-point energy gravitates in atoms but not in the vacuum (details here) are good problems. -->



## Particle Problems

**2. Particle Masses**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The 5 Layers and [the 2 Forces](/superphysics/principles/chapter-05/)


**4. Turbulence**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The 2 forces on the aether is the cause of all turbulence 


**8. The Matter-Antimatter**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: [The metaphysical domain](/superphysics/principles/chapter-01/)


**9. Friction**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: The Five Layers




## Systemic Problems


**3. The “Measurement” Problem**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: Use the aether as the measure via [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04b/) or data science


**7. Complexity**

- Cause of Problem: Material Influence
- Solution: Use the aether as the measure via qualimath or data science



**10. The “Arrow of Time”**

- Cause of Problem: General Relativity
- Solution: The [Cartesian View](/material/solutions/cartesian-view/)

![Aether](/graphics/physics/aether.jpg)




As you can see, the main culprit is the super strong influence of matter on humans minds. This can only be caused by the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti). This manifests as over-quantification, selfishness, preference for material perceptions and sight and, consequently, physical bodies. 

The general solution is to use the Postive Force (Yang or Shiva) which is represented by fellow-feeling, selflessness, preference for feelings and the heart and consequently, the abstract mind.

Newtonian Physics only deals with bodies perceived by sight. That is why it only works for material perceptions, up to the electromagnetic perceptions.

[Cartesian Physics](/material/principles/intro/chapter-03/) works both on body and mind and so solves all the problems that Newtonian physics cannot.

Our common solutions to these 10 problems are the aether and the 5 layers which the Hindus called

1. Prithvi/Bhudevi (Strong Force) 
2. Apas/Varuna/Jala (Weak Force)
3. Agni (Electromagnetism)
4. Vayu (Spacetime)
5. Akasha (Aether)


<!-- The proper combination of the Negative and Positive should result in both critical thinking and critical feeling.  -->
