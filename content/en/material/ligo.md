In the 19th century, nearly all physicists embraced the aether of Rene Descartes as the medium that gave light its wave properties.

All that was needed was to get proof of the aether by measuring the changes in the speed of light in different times in a year. Such changes would then be evidence of an 'aether wind' that 'blew' light. 

This was done through an 'interferometer' as the Michelson-Morley experiment

That experiment showed that the speed of light is the same everywhere, and so there was no aether wind.

Lorentz fixed this by saying that light had a constant speed because space was contracting at the same time with the aether wind. This led to the concept of 'length contraction'.

Einstein hacked this by saying that space and time was a single thing. Aside from length contraction, there is also time dilation which is measured by using light as the timer. 

Unlike Einstein, Lorentz (and Poincare) did not unify space with time because they knew that time was ultimately an arbitrary mental measure and not a physical one. 

But Einstein created spacetime anyway, as his Theory of Relativity which replaced the aether with light. 

This nullified the importance of the aether and made spacetime the supreme medium, with light as its measuring tool.

The problem with this is that it trapped all of Physics (an Einstein-trap), with absurd statements like "nothing travels faster than light", "the arrow of time moves forward only", "gravity is not a force", "wormholes lead to other dimensions", etc.

This then led to the Cosmology Crisis and the inability to explain or harness dark energy and dark matter, or even do simple anti-gravitation. 

We explain that time has 2 aspects: mental and physical. 

Spacetime having a physical and a mental property is similar to light having a particle property and a wave property.

The mental spacetime and waves of light are the parts that are closer to pure aether. The physical spacetime and particles of light are the parts that are farther. 

The original Michelson-Morley experiment used a crude interferometer equipment and could only therefore detect high-level aether wind, as 299,796 km/s different from Fizeau's 315,000 km/s  using human history (not light) as the timer.

LIGO was an improved interferometer and accordingly could detect the physical aether wind which are now called gravitational waves.

The division of spacetime into mental and physical is exactly the mind-body division proposed by Descartes, the very same man who proposed the modern aether theory.

Descartes can easily free Physics from the trap that Einstein put it in, and unlock new technologies for exploring the rest of the universe far better and safer than Newtonian rockets.
