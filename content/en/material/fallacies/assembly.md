Assembly Theory is a monstrosity that happens when the material concept of non-conscious entropy and the emergent 'arrow of time' (physical time) are merged with conscious biology (mental time).

Assembly Theory uses 'memory' to unify both. 

In reality, they are confusing memory with probability which they call 'combinatons' creating an assembly index. 

The Aether theory of the 5 Elements model is already complete and far superior to assembly theory and is already used most obviously in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. 

We can estimate the amount of aether in a physical body or metaphysical idea by comparison over spacetime. 

We have low tech ways to detect whether an object was 'evolved' or not.

Assembly Theory on the other hand measures their 'combinations' via electromagnetism: MRI, infrared, spectrometry.

We explain that Life takes time to evolve because it has to wait for the 5 Elements to perfect themselves. It is not because they have to go through a predetermined time depth.

Assembly Theory creates absurdities like "time is expanding, not space" and "imagining timelessness requires time". 

In reality, what they call time is really the sequence of perceptions. And so it tales more perceptions before life emerges and for matter to gain complexity. In this case, the causal mechanism is the aethereal mind and not physical time.
