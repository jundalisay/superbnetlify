The fallacies of dark matter, wormholes, and the big bang come from the sophistry of Newton and Einstein.

According to Pythagoras and Kepler, motion is sourced from an invisible, immaterial "monad". We combine this with Asian philosophy to say that monads rotate in a counter-clockwise direction due to the influence of the Two Forces.

The strength and rotation of a monad then creates a spatial gravitational "field" as "geodesics" which become orbits when another monad enters it. Within planets, this creates their "oblate spheroid" shape.

Kepler lists 5 kinds of monads: 2 are of the immaterial category and 3 are material. Instead of calling them cube, tetrahedron, etc we call them do, re, mi, sol, la, as Pythagoras' "sesquialter" and the Chinese pentatonic scale. 

"Do" is the monad of planets, "Sol" is the monad of stars such as our sun. Thus, "La" is the monad of galaxies.

Kepler calls the gravity between the monads as "kinship".
<!-- , Einstein calls it "relativity".  -->

Instead of using light as a yardstick, Kepler uses the gravitational relativity between two monads. There are 20, such as:
- Do-Do
- Do-Re
- Do-Mi
- etc. 

Newton's Gravity is therefore `Do-Do` and `Do-Sol`. 

Einstein's Special Relativity is `Mi-Mi` and `Mi-Re`. 

General Relativity is `Mi-Do` and `Mi-Sol`.

Monads of the same category attract each other at the same rate. 

This is why stars move at the same speed around the center of their galaxy regardless of their distance, just as 2 different weights fall to the ground at the same time as proven by Galileo.

A person ignorant of gravitational relativities will imagine that heavier objects fall faster, just as Vera Rubin imagined that a galaxy's inner stars travel faster than its outer ones.

This means that there are two inverse square laws: one for the material and another for the immaterial. These render dark matter, wormholes, and the big bang unnecessary, and will allow artificial gravity to be realized.
