<!-- heading = "All Movement is Sourced Internally"
Unlike Physics which says movement is sourced externally, Superphysics asserts that all movement is internal -->

<!-- Can't find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6)? That's because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.
 -->


In Superphysics, physical existence is made when the aether arbitrarily creates **q**uanta **o**f **s**pace**t**ime or [qost](/material/principles/qost)*, which are 1-dimensional points, within itself. Each point is a discrete and unique identity filled with an arbitrary amount of qualities as potentiality. 


> *pronounced as 'kost'. This is supposed to be the graviton which will never be found, because it can only be felt since it lies in the spatial layer which is above the visible eletromagnetic layer. Nor can it be detected directly by instruments that use electromagnetism. It can only be detected by spacetime itself (as gravitational waves or vibrations which lie in the same spatial layer) or by minds and feelings (which lie in the aethereal layer above it). 



<!-- <p>It can be detected indirectly by electromagentism. For example, LIGO uses lasers to detect gravitational waves.</p> -->


<!-- However, this detection is partly sophistical because it imposes the properties of electromagentism onto the properties of spacetime. A person interpreting LIGO data will interpret gravitational waves to travel at the speed of light simply because light was used to measure it.</p>

## Push!

These identities push each other to preserve their identity while innumerable qosts are created. This preservation is caused by [the Law of Conservation of Idea](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03), a concept not present in Physics nor Science. 


This pushing is based on the existential principle to preserve the discreteness of identity. This principle* then leads to:
- the law of conservation of mass
- the law of conservation of energy

> *The main difference between our unification and the one done by Einstein is that Einstein uses light or Electromagnetism as the unifying medium, whereas we use the aether. 


The pushing leads to the creation and expansion of physical space, first as 2-dimensional (Pythagorean duad) and then into 3-dimensions (triad). The sequence of expansion then leads to physical time as the fourth dimension (tetrad), leading to 4-dimensional "Minkowski" spacetime to an observer.

This "pushing" is similar to the theory of Descartes which was destroyed by Newton:

{{< q a="smith" >}}
According to Descartes, through an eternal revolution from rest to motion and motion to rest, the amount of motion in the universe was always the same. But there was no void. No part of matter could be moved without thrusting some other out of its place. The matter which any body pushed before it, rolled immediately backwards, to supply the place of that matter which flowed in behind it. This is similar to the swimming of a fish. The water, which it pushes before it, immediately rolls backwards, to supply the place of what flows in.<br><br> It thus forms a vortex around the body of the fish. In the same way, the motion originally impressed by the Creator on matter produced in it an infinity of vortices, or circular streams. 

<cite>The History of Astronomy by Adam Smith Simplified</cite>
{{< /q >}}



Creation goes on to make the 5th, 6th, and 7th dimensions*. However, only the four dimensions are visible to our ordinary senses, since the 5th to 7th are metaphysical in essence. 


> *The 7 dimensions match the 7 chakras in Hinduism and is essential in Ayurveda, which we classify under [Bio Superphysics](/medical). The sequence of creation is actually in reverse. From the Creator's perspective, it starts from the 7th then goes down to the 1st dimension. But from our perspective as 'createes', it's from the 1st to the 7th.  


Thus, spacetime is created by the mere existence or popping-in of the qosts from the aether. This gives the **illusion** of movement by one qost against the other when in fact, none of them are moving. The only real movement is their appearance into reality or actuality coming from nonreality or probability.

## The Aether: The Source of All Movement in the Physical Universe

{{< q a="smith" >}}
[According to Descartes]..the Sun was the fiery center of a circular stream of ether, which flowed continually round her.

<cite>The Simplified History of Astronomy by Adam Smith</cite>
{{< /q >}}


The aether is a metaphysical thing that is central to Plato (Timaeus), Descartes, Hinduism, and Buddhism (as citta). 

The problem is that people interpreted it to be physical or perceivable to our five senses. 

Descartes is correct that motion is affected by the aether, but is incorrect in saying that the aether is physical in nature as to affect planets and galaxies **directly**. 

In reality, the aether* is invisible and immaterial. It interacts instead with feelings and ideas since it *is* the material of feelings, ideas, and the abstract minds that contain those feelings and ideas.  

> *We write aether with an "a" to differentiate it from the disproven* ether of science and Descartes. This is similar to writing dialectics as "Socratic Dialectics" to set it apart from the corrupted dialetics of Marx.  Einstein claims that the Michelson and Morley experiment disproved the ether. In reality, it merely proved that the aether does not reside in the spacetime layer, but in its own layer as the aethereal layer.


<!-- Instead, the aether is the medium for metaphysical things like ideas*, thoughts, beliefs, minds, souls, spirit, and feelings.  -->

The metaphysical idea* for a galaxy then is translated into an actual physical galaxy by qosts (monads, gravitons, Schwarzschild radii) of the spatial layer.


> *This leads to the [Socratic Theory of Forms](/research/socrates/phaedo/chapter-8), which leads to Essences


{{< q a="mont" >}}
Intelligent beings might have laws of their own making. But they also have some which they never made. Before there were intelligent beings, they were a possibility.

<cite>Spirit of the Laws, Book 1</cite>
{{< /q >}}



The cause of spacetime therefore is the cognition of this appearance of qosts which is caused by internal "aethereal"* factors. This is the opposite of Newton and Einstein who believed that movement is sourced from matter. 

> *For example, your physical hand moves to grab a book because your athereal mind had an athereal feeling to grab it. Someone might tell you to grab the book, as to give the illusion that the source of the hand-movement was external from that person. But you can still refuse to grab the book due to your free will, and so the source of the resulting non-movement is still internal athereal feelings.

## Replacing Einstein's "Time"

Einstein defined time as the time that it takes for light to travel between two events in spacetime. But this is circular reasoning since the speed of light also has a time component. Moreover, we defined spacetime as the effect of the qosts creating distance between each other, even before light existed. How can something non-existent define something that already exists?  


{{< q a="einbla" >}}
We test simultaniety by putting an observer in the middle M between A and B. He as two mirrors inclined at 90Â° to let him see both A and B at the same time. If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.
<br><br>
You object by saying that they would only be true, that time would be simultaniety, if all light travels at a constant speed. <i><b>But the speed of light would itself be measured by time, so this is reasoning in a circle -- simultaniety has absolutely nothing to do with light.</b></i>
<br><br>
I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions. 

<cite>Relativity by Einstein Simplified, Section 8</cite>

<!-- Spacetime exists before, and independent of, light and electromagnetism. So how can something like light -- something that is unnecessary to spacetime -- be required to define spacetime? -->

Einstein's definition turns the effect as the cause which leads to make-your-own-spacetime such as De Sitter, Taub-Nut, and Godel, etc. If we exist in one universe, how can it have different spacetimes?

![E=mc2](/images/visible.jpg)

{{< cap >}}
E=mc^2 is true only if applied to visible objects. But no one seemed to notice it because everyone is likewise taking the perspective of the visible universe. The sophistry (half-truth, half-fallacy) of this equation is exposed by the fact that Einstein's field equations can't be solved and that wormholes have never been found.

<!-- > *The theoretical and arbitrary spacetimes are a consequence of General Relativity which uses light as a measure of everything. The problem with this is that light is an electromagnetic wave which manifests in a field, of which the nature is arbitrary just as each wavelength has its own properties. This leads to arbitrarily-invented spacetimes like De Sitter, Taub-Nut, Godel, etc. This is the same mechanism that causes human minds to create arbitrarily-invented concepts like God, Allah, Yahweh, Amaterasu, etc.  -->



To create a single model for spacetime, we lay a maxim that <b>the cause of all movement is internal</b>, having two sources:
<!-- > *Since this appearance is made by the act of cognition, then we can say that the movement comes from the actual observation.  is the  -->
1. The existence and qualities of the object for that layer
2. The cognition of the observer of the existence and qualities of that object

![Superphysics movement](/images/spmovement.jpg)

{{< cap >}}
Superphysics sources spatial movement internally from the center of gravity of discrete identities. Physics sources its movement from external forces or concepts, like the sophistical fabric of spacetime.

## Let's Get Moving!

These two make objects appear to move, depending on the rules of their layer and their relation to each other and to the observer. We can call this illusory movement in physical reality as 'relational physical movement' which we simplify as 'bands' and can be grouped into the five layers:

<!-- Since human bodies are in the material layer, then   -->

Name | Physics Name | Manifestation | Practical Goal
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Aethereal Bands](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-03) | Pseudo-science | Movement and transformation for qoas (ideas) between probabilities or multiverses inside minds | Bio Superphysics: know whether a person is moving towards disease so his course can be changed<br>Supersociology: know where the feeling of society is heading, so it doesn't go into anarchy<br>Economics: know whether the economy is moving towards poverty and inequality
[Spatial Bands](/material/principles/part-3/chapter-03) | General Relativity | Movement of supermassive blackholes (qosts) as the expansion of the universe and galaxy rotation | [Allow fusion](/articles/material/fusion) by levitating plasma, and allow teleportation to other galaxies
[Radiant Bands](/material/principles/part-4/chapter-03) | Special Relativity | Movement and transformation for photons (quanta of light or qol) and electrons (quanta of electromagnetism or qoe) | Make [light-based computing](/material/solutions/light-based-computing) more practical
[Transformative Bands](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03) | Feynman Diagrams | Movement and transformation for neutrons | Allow alchemy 
[Material Bands](/material/principles/part-6/chapter-03) | Newton's Laws | Movement and transformation sourced externally | Enable teleportation and levitation technologies


When combined with each other, <!-- , together with the metaphysical relativity (not discussed here), --> these are called **universal relativity**. External movement seems most obvious in the material layer. This manifests as a ball being moved by an external push, or a floating asteroid being moved by being hit by another asteroid. But on closer inspection, these are still sourced internally from their mass. 

<!-- Thus:

```universal relativity = aethereal relativity + gravitational relativity + radiant relativity + radioactive relativity + material relativity``` -->

<!-- The movement is caused by the observer -->

<!-- To totally control the movement of any object, such as a ball or an asteroid, you have to know its nature in the five layers to get its five relativities. Afterwards, it would be possible to make it zip, levitate, twirl, etc. Of course this would be nearly impossible since anyone who would know the nature of an object in the five layers would be omniscient, and an omniscient being would have more better things to do than to make a physical object zip, levitate, and twirl.

Humans are more limited but are able to know the principles of  -->

Time, then, like space, is subjective and not a constant. It is dictated by the aethereal layer, just as the speed of light is dictated by spacetime or the spatial layer.



## Let's put all human understanding together

From here, we can unify the ideas of the great physicists:

Physicist | Mistake | Cause of Mistake | Correction | Superphysics Score
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Kepler | The universe is confined to a fixed firmament | Limited observations | The universe is infinite (arbitrary) | 8/10
Descartes | Gravity is caused by the aether which creates spinning vortices | Imposing the aethereal layer directly onto the physical layer | The aether is in a separate layer that affects the physical layer indirectly. This leads to the spinning of galaxies and orbital movements | 7/10
Newton | Gravity comes from mass | No observations of galactic movements | Mass comes from gravity, gravity comes from the aether | 5/10
Einstein | Gravity comes from mass through the distortions of the spacetime fabric or field | Using light as the measuring rod | Use sound as the measuring rod, in line with Kepler and Pythagoras | 3/10

<!-- An example of an aethereal object is a mind. This is why time flies when a mind is having fun. Whereas physical time is constant   -->



<!-- This is in line with David Hume saying that his 'science of man' (the basis of Superphysics) will be much more useful than the prevailing sciences.
 -->  
As you can see, aethereal bands are far more important than spatial bands and that is why we are focusing on it more. As such, we will explain it next by explaining the aethereal layer.
