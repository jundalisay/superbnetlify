To solve the mysteries in Physics, such as gravitation, dark matter, and dark energy, we replace Newton's Three Laws with the Three Rules of Descartes.

Rule 1 absorbs Newton's First and Second Laws.

Rule 2 matches Newton's Third Law.

Rule 3 leads to angular momentum and the path integrals of Quantum Mechanics.

Newton was unable to think of probabilistic paths because he ascribed the cause of movement to matter. This led him to believe that gravity was a pulling force which did not necessitate different paths.

In reality, gravity is pushing force from the invisible aether that directs things towards mass. <!-- This manifests as the -->

Rule 3 is important because it has relativity baked in, leading to gravitational lensing and wave-particle duality. This removes the need for Einstein's fabric, tensors, and c. It restores gravity as a force and demotes spacetime as an illusory effect of gravitation instead of being its cause.

<!-- Superhysics uses the 3 Rules of Movement from Descartes instead of the Law of Motion from Isaac Newton. This is because Newton's laws are already included in the Rules of Descartes.   -->
