In Cartesian Physics, gravity is a force from the gravitational band between masses, stars, or galaxies.

The water spins because the energy is transferred to it by the bucket. There is a dip in the center because that is the center of gravity of the bucket, which serves as the anchor for the gravitational band between the water and the bucket and the Earth. 

In outer space, the bucket will be a torus and the water will form a donut shape since there is no band with the Earth. 

Proper Time passes faster on a mountain because it covers more space for the same amount of Coordinate time, so Proper time adjusts accordingly. 

Let's say 2 mountain proper milliseconds pass for every 1 sea proper millisecond. This is to compensate for the 1 coordinate millisecond taken by the perspective of guy at sealevel who really bases both measurements from the center of the Earth. Proof is that the Hafeleâ€“Keating experiment showed difference between East and West travel.

If Proper Time were measured based on the Sun, then their Proper time would be the same: 12 noon sharp.

Einstein's Relativity only accounts for the gravity between matter and matter, and the gravity between light and stars/galaxies. It does not account for the gravity between galaxies and stars (dark matter), galaxies and galaxies (dark energy).

Cartesian Physics does.
