The spatial layer is below the aethereal. It leads to spacetime and sets the speed of light. 

It manifests as the space, size, and age of the universe. It gives the ideas and energies from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via gravitation through stars and galaxies. 

The creation of gravitational nodes leads to the mutual repulsion between nodes, leading to the perception of space and time.

In terms of creation, this is the second layer that processes ideas from the aethereal layer into possible energies and matter.


<!-- the mind or soul. We can say that the universe is one huge mind, which the Hindus call Brahma. In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.

In Physics, this layer manifests as the Higgs Field. 

Descartes classifies this aether into two:
- The high energy aethereal fire: This matches the High energy Higgs Field, and roughly the Yin of Taoism 
- The low energy aethereal air: This matches the Low energy Higgs Field, and the Yang -->

Physicists are unable to find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6) because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.

This spin maniflests as:
- the rotation direction in the spatial layer
- the spin of particles in the radiant layer.
