<!-- Spatial Relativity is the Superphysics alternative to General Relativity. It is the ratio between the inherent quality of each qost or center of gravity.

- If Qost A has an inherent quality that is 100 units repulsive to Qost B, then the spacetime between them might be 100 distance-units per 1 unit of time-perception. 
- But if Qost C is only 50 units repulsive, then Qost C will be 50 units away from Qost B at the same time. 
- This would show Qost A moving faster away from Qost B than Qost C. 
  - In Physics, this manifests as it having a red-shift which will indicate a growing distance.

 This ratio* is called 'gravitational relativity' for the spatial layer. -->

<!-- Our universal equation at rest is E = G<sub>l</sub>

Our general equation in motion is G<sub>1(s)</sub> : G<sub>2(s)</sub>

- G is the gravitational signature of the identity. Most of the time, this leads to mass
- s is the set of constants that rule in that layer
- G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub> are the identities in question

Here we explain material relativity. -->

According to Newton's Second Law, net force equals mass times acceleration. This is fine for ordinary things like a ball (mass) which is pushed (force) to start rolling (acceleration). 

But what about a 50 kilogram Buddhist monk who floats and accelerates 1 meter/second {{< s v="2" >}} without any force? How can `0 = 50 1m/s^2`?

## Aethereal Effort

To account for this, we modify Newton's vector into a Kepler tensor that transforms based on a limiter `s`. The limiter represents the Negative force or Shakti or Yin.  

A 2D limiter that splits perceptions into seconds will convert `F = ma` on Earth into `Gm^1 [GP second] : Gm^2 [GP second]` based on the Earth's perspective `GP`*

> *Qualimath does away with Greek notation

Thus, the monk `m` in location `x1` floats to location `x2` by successfully changing its state or perspective `Gm` relative to that of the Earth `GP`. The new force, as a **metaphysical Effort**, then results or is derived from the difference between the two states, which may be larger or smaller than the old physical Force.  

```elixir
E = Gm2 [GP second] - Gm1 [GP second]
```

#

```elixir
1 = 2 - 1
```

#

Thus, it took 1 unit of effort to levitate 1 meter/second^2 with zero physical force. 

Note that this quantified effort is relevant only to the monk himself and cannot be used for comparison with the effort of other monks. It can only be compared to the past and future effort of that monk, where he compares himself with himself since the effort is metaphysical and bound to his own mind*.

> *His mind is necessarily attached to his body which he moves by this kind of effort, without any force.  


## Physical Force

We then apply the formula to a 50 kg block pushed forward accelerating constantly at 1 m/s{{< s v="2" >}}

```elixir
F = Gm2 [GP second] - Gm1 [GP second]
```

#

```elixir
50N = 100N - 50N
```

#

This gives us the same result as `F = m a`

The main difference is that this new version splits the identity of the object into two or more different objects. The block at time 2 location 2 is different from the same block at time 1 location 1 in the sense that it has absorbed force and changed its locational attributes. This will then be useful for teleportation by a change in spin*.



> *This is based on David Hume's [idea of the self](/medical/mental/principles/idea-of-self) 

Newton's laws, however, see the object as the same object. This limits it to linear, forced movements.
<!-- It focuses on the journey and not the destination.   -->

Metaphysically:
- the Kepler tensor represents the Yang or Shiva
- the limiter represents the Yin or Shakti
- the `G` represents dharma, which is Yang-Shiva when confined by Yin-Shakti

The block at time 2 location 2 is different from the same block at time 1 location 1 in the sense that it has absorbed force and changed its locational attributes. This will then be useful for teleportation by a change in spin.

Newton's laws, however, see the object as the same object. This limits it to linear, forced movements.

- From the perspective of planets, the limiter takes the form of Newton's `G`, which leads to `g` when two masses are added 
- From the perspective of light, the limiter takes the form of Einstein's `c`, which leads to relative space versus time when "reference frames" are added
- From the perspective of galaxies, the limiter takes the form of an aethereal "dark matter", which leads to "dark energy" when red shift is added

Thus, the limiter harmonizes the theories of Pythagoras, Newton, Einstein, and Descartes


## Newton's `G` and `g`

The `G` of Newton is the general push-force of the Material Aether* onto material bodies affected by the Strong force. `g` is its specific push-force on the Earth that leads to 9.81 m/s^2. The `g` of earth is different from the `g` of Jupiter. 

It follows that the `G` of the Milky way can be different from the `G` of other galaxies. This gives the diversity of galaxy colors and forms. 

> *The universe has 5 layers and so 5 aethers. We call the material aether occasionally as "Descartes' Earth" or "Stokes Aether"
