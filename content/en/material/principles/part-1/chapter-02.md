We all know that physical reality exists inside space and time, and that space and time are the properties of the universe. But how were space and time and the universe created?

According to Physics, it was created through a "Big Bang" of a material Singularity. This led to matter and energy, just as we see sharpnel and light, and feel the energy from exploding fireworks. What is the nature of this Material Singularity? How did it begin? 

{{< color color="red" value="No one is able to answer this." >}}


Superphysics answers that the whole Big Bang paradigm is flawed in the first place because material creation did not originate from a material cause. A material explosion would need an external trigger or cause to start that explosion just as a firecracker needs an external flame to light its fuse. That would imply that our Big Bang **happened within another universe**. This would then lead to more unanswered questions that can go on to infinity, since that universe could be within another universe, and so on. 


## A Big Bootup or Wakeup, Instead of a Material Big Bang

Instead of a material cause, Superphysics asserts a **metaphysical cause**. For example:
- a physical novel is made up of the ideas of its author
  - a novel cannot be written by another novel
- a physical website is made up of the code-ideas of the programmer
  - a website cannot be made by another website


{{< img src="/graphics/flipbook.gif" alt="Flipbook" cap="The universe is a compilation of static ideas stitched together by sequential perception" >}}


Likewise, all universes came from the ideas of the Creator. The material universe cannot be made by itself nor by another material universe. The question then is how are these ideas created? How do they become as complex as a universe?

The conversion of idea to reality and physical matter follows a five-step process which we call our five-layer model, derived from the Greeks and Asians:

Phase | Layer | Physics Name | Sequence  
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | Metaphysical | Pseudo-science | The pre-existing ideas as potentialities are deployed onto reality
1 | Aethereal | Higgs | The aether compiles the <!-- potential ideas as actual --> compound ideas as potential universes in the multiverse
2 | Spatial | Gravitation | The compiled ideas are sent through qosts as galaxies and then as stars. These create space and time, as well as gravity
3 | Radiant | Electromagnetism | The gravity in the stars create electrons and photons which are emitted throughout the space
4 | Transformative | Weak force | The weak force in stars further creates neutrons which create fusion, allowing particles to combine
5 | Material | Strong force | Finally, the strong force binds the particles as protons to form the elements


<!-- spacetime is the second perceivable layer and is created by the relativistic interaction of quanta of spacetime (qost) on each other.  -->

<!--  must have mass., the discrete identity of gravity is contained in a few objects such as --> 

<!--  Physics has a belief that gravity comes from mass and so they do not really assign gravity or 'singularity' to planets.  -->

## Phase 1: From potentiality to actuality

The infinite ideas of the Creator move down as real ideas or qoa in the aethereal layer. From pre-existence, each quantum of idea goes down onto the aether creating a single identity or `1`. The combination of ideas then lead to an infinite combination of compound ideas such as `100101` or `110010`. This stream of compound, binary ideas then form a very complex wave, which stream with other waves of infinite number and variety. 

In this way, we can think of the multiverse of ideas as:

Sequence | Analogy | 
--- | ---
1 | Note | Object
2 | Chord | Planet 
3 | Tune | Solar system
4 | Song | Galaxy
5 | Genre | Universe 

All these universes exist simultaneously in the aethereal layer, as a multiverse. Because of human limitations, we can see only one universe, our current one. The universes in the aethereal layer occupy no space since they are above the spatial layer. 

<!-- Another idea comes in, leading to two point-identities "1" and "1". However since identity must be unique, then the first "1" has to push the second "1" away. This creates a unit of space "0" between them as "101". 

More ideas come in, each with its own preference for identity and thererfore space so the universe can become "101001000101". Thus, the binary existence becomes more complex.

## Time travel and intra-universe travel is done at the Athereal layer

A mastery of the aethereal layer, as done by Buddhist monks, allows them to view the other universes, either as alternate realities or the past or future of the current one. They do this by transporting their mind to those other universes and timelines, and then coming back to this one.

In theory, the same mastery can be applied to vehicles which are run by sentient artificial intelligence for those vehicles to travel between universes and in different timelines of those universes. 


<!-- ### All Ideas, Feelings, Beliefs, Minds, and Souls are in the Aethereal Layer   -->

All the ideas in the universe exist in the aethereal layer, even our feelings, minds, and beliefs. 

The next post will explain the Quantum of Spacetime or Qost which is Phase 2 of creation, and the second layer of our model.

<!--  gravitational layer as "quanta of spacetime". This allowed the idea to have "space" after other ideas came down with it. For example, "1" alone has no space. But "1 and 1" necessarily creates a space between the two 1's. 

We can say that the space between the two 1's are made up of zeros or empty 1's. So instead of "1 and 1", we now have "100001". -->   

<!-- In this model, space and time are the second layer and is subordinate to the aethereal. Examples aethereal things are minds, ideas, feelings, and the Higgs 'field'. Thus, a universe with spacetime removed becomes the Mind of the Creator, which the Hindus call Brahma*. This is somewhat consistent with the Higgs particle being called the God-particle. We can also refer to it as a virtual reality Matrix, in reference to the movie. -->


<!-- > *Brahma here just means the totality of whatever is existing. We could call it something else like ToE for "Totality of Existence". But that would be bad SEO (Search Engine Optimization) since no one googles for ToE. Thus, we stick with "Brahma"  -->


<!-- call the
An idea is superior to spacetime, and so we never assign dimensions to an idea or a feeling. Likewise, the start of the universe or 'Big Bang' cannot have a starting point in spacetime.  

Instead of a Big Bang, it would be more proper to compare the creation of the universe as a Big Awakening or a Big Bootup, similar to how a computer converts static code-ideas into active virtual objects.  -->
 
<!-- To be created, each object is assigned a place in the computer's memory as a block. A large app needs more memory and uses more blocks than a tiny app. Likewise, the universe is made up of such placeholder blocks which we call quanta of spacetime or qost*. -->


<!-- > *The original Pythagorean version is "monad". The original Hindu version is "jiva". We use "quantum" to emphasize that these are totally based on human perceptions. This means that animals or aliens might see stars and blackholes in a totally different way with different dynamics. Our qosts, therefore, are only for the human perspective. Other species might sense creation in other ways.  -->


<!-- This means that the definitions here work only for our current multiverse which we all perceive in a consistent way -->
