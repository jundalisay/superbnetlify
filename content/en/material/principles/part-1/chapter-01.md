The aethereal is the highest layer in the universe, and is underneath only the metaphysical layer, which itself is bounded by pre-existence.

This layer is best represented by the mind or soul. We can say that the universe is one huge mind, which the Hindus call Brahma. In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.

Unlike Science and New Age philosophy that puts emphasis on consciousness as to put all existential mysteries in it, Superphysics puts all the mysteries in the aether which is the material or principles of the mind. This is because consciousness is just 'on' or 'off' just as existence either "exists" or "doesn't exist".  

In Physics, this layer manifests as the Higgs Field which has many unknown properties, consistent with the current lack of understanding of the physical universe.

This layer dominates and rules the other four layers, just like spacetime dominates light as to give it a speed limit, and light dominates matter as to prevent two rocks from merging or passing through each other. 

Descartes classifies this aether into two:
- The high energy aethereal fire: This matches the High energy Higgs Field, and roughly the Yin of Taoism 
- The low energy aethereal air: This matches the Low energy Higgs Field, and the Yang

<!-- A unit example is a human mind.  -->

In terms of creation, this layer is the first layer that precedes physical manifestation. Since it is above spacetime, it is beyond Einstein's rule that nothing can travel faster than light. Thus, time travel and teleportation to other multiverses is facilitated by this layer.
