In Cartesian Physics, there are 3 kinds of refraction of starlight (gravitational lensing):

1. Galactic
2. Stellar
3. Material


The 1919 Eddington experiment is a stellar gravitational lensing.

Galactic gravitational lensing are the more common ones such as galaxy cluster Abell 1689.

Descartes explained that these are caused by the heliospheres of stars and galaxies, and not their mass. 

This is why Cartesian Physics predicts that there is none or insignificant lensing in planets (as material lensing).
