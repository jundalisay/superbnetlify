La Dioptrique is the counterpart (or rival) of Newton's Principia, while Traité du monde is the counterpart of Newton's System of the World. 

Quantum mechanics: In Meditations, Descartes correctly says that reality is not real. In Traité du monde, he explains that the aether travels instantly. We combine these to make a roadmap for teleportation tech and make masses travel faster than light (which is impossible to Newton or Einstein).

Relativity: Relativity is baked into Descartes Third Rule of Motion. Newton does not have relativity in his laws because he assumed a static material universe.    

Gravity: Descartes' gravity is consistent with Kepler's gravity as invisible chains or slings. I call it bands so that w = mg becomes w = mb. Instead of focusing on mass, the focus is on the elasticity of the band which has realtivity baked in. This negates any need for Einstein and so things can travel faster than c again. It's the liberation of Physics from the dark ages of Einstein.

Electromagnetism: Descartes' was one of the first to draw a magentic field. His focus was light and not electricity because light is the subtler part of electromagnetism, electricity is the cruder part. This is why we advcoate light-based computing over electron-based computing. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Descartes_magnetic_field.jpg

Black Holes: Descartes calls them void and explained how vortices and lensing work on them. The swirl of a Cartesian vortex (black hole) was recently proven by Sagitarrius A and Messier 87. To Cartesian physics, a Newtonian singularity that violates physics is absurd because vortices already work fine.
