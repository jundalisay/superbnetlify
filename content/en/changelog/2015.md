Jan 1 | After simplifying [The Wealth of Nations](/research/smith/wealth-of-nations/) last year, I started simplifying [The Theory of Moral Sentiments](/research/smith/theory-moral-sentiments/). I also started prototyping Adam Smith's economic system in PHP, Groovy, and Ruby, while trying out Graph Databases
Apr 23 | I started reorganizing content here into a book, with posts being categorized into chapters
Oct 24 | I found a team and started pitching my prototype using Ruby Sinatra during [the UN Hack for Good Challenge](https://www.pantrypoints.com/news/15-10-24/) in Hanoi
