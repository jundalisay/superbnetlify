Feb 21 | We started trying out Medium for our content on the science behind Social Resource Allocation, as 'SORAnomics'
June 16 | We started slowly moving our content from Wordpress onto Medium
Oct 1 | After finishing [hackathons in August](https://www.pantrypoints.com/news/19-08-30/), we had time to dwell back on the grand theory which will implement Hume's 'Science of Man'. Our choices for the name of the theory was 'Superscience', 'Suprascience', 'Superphysics', or 'Supraphysics'. We ended up with '[Superphysics](https://medium.com/soranomics/presenting-superphysics-a6119d072520)' because 'science' is relatively new, while 'physics' is much more ancient.
Nov 19 | SORAnomics has been absorbed into Superhysics and renamed into Economic Superphysics or 'Supereconomics'. We put its implementation into [a separate site](https://www.pantrypoints.com) away from Superphysics to split theory from implementation
