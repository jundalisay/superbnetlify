Feb 20 | We posted our video explaining our [Elastic Theory of Gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMOftV0yfso)
Mar 1 | Started simplifying [Le Sage](/research/lesage/gravity/) after getting feedback for our Elastic Theory
Mar 3 | Started simplifying [Leibniz](/research/leibniz/monadology/part-1/) and found that his Monads are his version of Aristotlean substance
Apr 22 | Changed 'Medical Superphysics' into 'Bio Superphysics' to better accommodate agriculture. In this way, both Medical Superphysics and Agricultural Superphysics (Supermedicine and Superagriculture) are under Bio Superphysics, just as Supereconomics and Supersociology (Economic Superphysics and Political Superphysics) are under Social Superphysics
