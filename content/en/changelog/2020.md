March | The Corona virus has caused lockdowns and so many startup events were cancelled. We will use the time to focus on theory of Superphysics and pause our running app prototypes.
Dec | The Delta Variant is quite scary and it seems the lockdowns will be here to stay as the 'new normal'. We took the time to really dig into Kepler's works in order to unearth his theory of gravity to replace that of Newton and Einstein.  We apply the theory to create action-at-a-distance by making a 1 kilogram weight lighter.
