Jan 1 | I started simplifying [A Treatise of Human Nature](/research/hume/treatise/) by David Hume and [The Ethics](/research/spinoza/simple-ethics) by Spinoza (which Hume bashed as hideous). I prefer to combine them into a single metaphysical system or paradigm 
Mar 1 | I joined Coderschool in Saigon to lean how to make the prototype better
May 28 | I re-formed a team and formally joined the Vietnam Silicon Valley (VSV) startup ecosystem as **NARA or Non-Arbitrary Resource Allocation**
July 16 | We pitched NARA at the VSV Summer Demo Day, changing it to SORA (SOcial Resource Allocation)
