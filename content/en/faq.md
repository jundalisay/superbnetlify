## Basics 

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
What is Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
Superphysics is the merging of Science and Metaphysics without going into the details of either. This acts as a bridge between ancient metaphysics and modern science, as explained by Francis Bacon.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
Natural science or theory is divided into physic and metaphysic.
<li>Physic should contemplate that which is inherent in matter, and therefore transitory.</li>
<li>Metaphysic should contemplate that which is abstracted and fixed.</li>
<li>Physic should handle that which supposeth in nature only a being and moving.</li>
<li>Metaphysic should handle that which supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding, and platform.</li>
<cite>Book 2 Part 7, The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified</cite>

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
So it's pseudo-science because it has metaphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
No. Superphysics upgrades science by adding metaphysics, similar to how Android is an upgrade of cellphones by adding installable apps.

Do we call a Samsung Android as a pseudo-Nokia 3310? 
{{< /l>}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
No. We call it a 'smart-phone'.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
Correct. We add the word 'smart.' Similarly, we add 'super' to 'physics' to set it apart. This is supported by Francis Bacon who called 'natural magic' as part of metaphysics.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Bacon" >}}
Superstitious narrations of sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinations, and the like, where there is an assurance and clear evidence of the fact, SHOULD NOT be excluded altogether. This is because it is not yet known in what cases and how far effects attributed to superstition do participate of natural causes. Therefore, howsoever the practice of such things is to be condemned, yet from the speculation and consideration of them, light may be taken for the further understanding of Nature.

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
**Socratic Dialectics** makes up the core of this 'super' upgrade as part of the process of data gathering, probing, and experimenting. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
How is Socratic Dialectics different from Dialectics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
The original dialectics was defined by Socrates to be based on Pythagorean metaphysics. But Aristotle hijacked dialectics and made his own version based an his own matter-based metaphysics (as 'substance'). The Germans, like Kant, Engels, Marx, and Einstein followed Aristotle. 

This led to **Dialectical Materialism** which is based on limited human logic and has caused a lot of problems in the world via Marxism and Communism. The goals of Marxism of freedom and justice are very good and noble, but its underlying metaphysics is totally junk. This leads to suffering instead of goodness.

Its rival Capitalism also embraces Aristotle, as proven by Ayn Rand and the subsequent 2008 Financial Crisis which also caused suffering.   

The enlightened philosophers like Hume and Ibn-Khaldun denounced Aristotle. So you can say we are fully in the Plato-Pythagoras-Hinduism-Buddhism-Taoism camp.  
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
How sure are you that Superphysics can solve what Science cannot?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="sp" >}}
Because we absorb all data, information, and human knowledge, even from Asia, Africa, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, even human information about aliens. 

Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism allow other dimensions by default. 

Even Islam has the concept of [Jinns](/research/mohammad/quran/sura-072). This gives us a bigger data set from which we can test their own principles on our reality.

This is different from Roman philosophy which has no metaphysics to allow other dimensions. Notice how Roman gods just mirror human characteristics. The Roman mentality evolved to be Western thinking and subsequently as Western Science. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
How do you weed out junk ideas like faeries and pixie dust?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
By finding consistent patterns. If all five continents have oral tradition of faeries and pixie dust that survive up to modern times, then there's some reality to it. But we find that there are none, so we cross it out as untrue.

Truth is the equality of perceptions. We're after true patterns that lead to the single truth, as the cause behind an issue or problem. This single truth represents the totality of perception. 

The most common pattern in all human societies is the belief in an afterlife or another type of reality, and so we drill down on that.  
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
So what have you found?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
That there is a Supreme Entity, called as God, Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Brahma, Amaterasu, etc. and that we are inside It. Parmenides calls It The One, and the Chinese call It The Tao.

This is similar to the idea that Descartes and Hegel had, despite them using non-Asian techniques. This One then generates everything **in real-time**. Again this is very different from the Roman or Jewish belief that the universe was pre-created, usually in 7 days.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
The real-time creation is like the movie "The Matrix", huh?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. It's more commonly known as theories that say that we exist in a simulation. Knowing how this simulation is sustained allows the possibility to tap into that inexhaustible creative or sustaining mechanism. 

We use it to solve all problems. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
So how can that knowledge solve problems? Are you just going to be like the Hindus and solve the problem by ignoring it and the illusion?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
No. Superphysics aims to solve problems by striking at the root cause, which is the 'True Nature' or Dharma or Tao in every thing that leads to its discrete identity, as described by Socrates. 

A problem begins when something goes away from its True Nature, Dharma, or Tao.

Most science just deals with effect and not cause because science is ignorant of metaphysics which is the real cause of anything in physics. The education system is supposed to help children discover their True Nature, Dharma, or Tao so that they can direct their lives towards it. But instead, it just molds them to be industrial workers (the dharma of business and industry). 

Ask anyone what the goal or purpose of the life is, and they will look at you with a blank stare. 

So the first step is to find the metaphysical true nature.

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
Can you give an example? How would Superphysics solve a headache?
{{< /r >}}


## Bio Superphysics

{{< l ava="Bio-Superphysics" >}}
By knowing the root cause of the headache. The cause could be diet, stress, congenital problem, bacteria, etc. The person might be doing something that is too stressful for his brain. 

Medical science deals with the headache by masking its pain (usually via Paracetamol) and not really dealing with what is causing the pain. This is to process patients faster since the body has its own natural healing mechanism. However, this also means that the headache can come back. Moreover, the doctor can only work with the data that the patient gives. 

Bio Superphysics gets all the data about the patient to find the pattern on which **[layer](/medical/physical/principles/5-paradigms/)** the cause is in. It then routes that patient to the proper specialist whether it be from Western medicine, yoga, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, etc.  

<!-- 
, on the other hand, gets not only all the data from the person to find out what the cause, but also the patterns from all the data. This is more difficult and time-consuming, but is able to give more lasting solutions.
Bio Superphysics gives the person to question himself and extract data from his habits and memory so he can find the root cause because

This technique is the original Socratic Dialectics and is actually done by Chinese medicine and Homeopathy. the Socratic-dialectical method is an upgrade of the scientific method which has a limited dataset. --> 
{{< /l >}}


<!-- combines the patient's knowledge of himself with the knowledge of the doctor regarding headaches. This combined knowledge can then point to the proper headache solutions whether it be from -->

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
So you want everyone to switch to alternative medicine?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Bio-Superphysics" >}}
No. Each [medical paradigm](/medical/physical/principles/5-paradigms) is a tool dealing with the five layers. You choose the medical paradigm for the right layer of the disease just as you use a hammer for nails and a screwdriver for screws.  It would be very ineffective to use a hammer to drive screws. 

But people often use alternative medicine for the wrong purpose and so it unfairly gets a bad reputation. 

Western medicine works best in the material layer but is awful at the mental layer. This is why the West has a lot of mental problems that lead to mass shootings. 

Yoga is great at the mental layer, but terrible at the material layer. This is why the West is usually so materially rich, while India is so materially poor.

## Bigots

{{< r ava="Boomer" >}}
But I'm a racist, materialist boomer. I don't like anything Asian and abstract like Brahma, Yin-Yang, human unity, circular economy and all that mumbo-jumbo. 

I want profits and wealth for myself. I drink my delicious expensive coffee conveniently with plastic straws, and don't care about the sea animals that will die from ingesting them. Sucks to be them.  

The universe was created for us humans, and not us humans created to serve the universe.  

After death, there is nothing. So I say maximize pleasure while alive and don't care about the consequences, even on others! 

So what if there's global warming? In the long-run, we're all dead! At least I've experienced a 5-star lifestyle. Heaven can be on earth, bought by money money money in a rich man's world. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
Ok boomer, so Superphysics isn't for you.

That's actually one of the attractions of Superphysics -- it rejects selfishness, vice, and the lack of virtue. You should stay in Quantum Physics, Economics, or some dogmatic religion that sees itself superior than others, or is limited to the 5 senses. Go ahead and exhaust your brain theorizing wormholes and dark matter that will never exist, or quantitative easing that either bloats the debt and shuts down governments or causes stagflation.

People who ascribe to Superphysics are open-minded and lovers of philosophy, nature, and the Supreme Entity, as explained by Socrates. These allow and develop the 6th sense of intuition and fellow-feeling, on top of the usual math and 5-sense cognitive abilities usually in IQ tests. 

We are targetting young people for this because they are the ones stuck with warmed-world destroyed by the previous generation. Notice how we use graphics and the chat format to appeal to young people.  <!-- , who took all the land, wealth, and capital and left none for the next generation. -->

The important thing is for the Boomer mentality to die with the Boomer generation and not cross over to Gen Z. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="Boomer" >}}
What makes you so absolutely sure that you know the nature of the universe? What is your qualification? I have a PhD from a top Western unviersity.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
We've had samadhi, after going through the necessary rigors.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="Boomer" >}}
What's samadhi?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
Google it.

All we can say is "No Samadhi, No Honey" (i.e. Without samadhi, you won't get a solid understanding of how the universe is structured and generated in real-time)
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
What does the Superphysics symbol mean?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
The blue triangle represents the metapyhsical dimension. The green triangle represents the physical dimension. These go in opposite directions. 

The yellow center is perception which balances both dimensions. 

Some people get filthy rich but lose their morals, while others are super spiritual but are dirt poor. 

For example, Baby-Boomers mindlessly push for GDP or ROI growth even if Nature is hitting them back with global warming caused by that very GDP and ROI from investments. 

Spiritual people, on the other hand, give donations and service, often unsustainably while creating a culture of dependence and poverty. 

Superphysics advocates a balance or a middle path.<!--  just like Buddhism advocates a middle path -->. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="asker" >}}
What's the gameplan of Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Superphysics" >}}
We need to prove that our principles are solid by demonstrating it in the real world. 

We've already proven Social Superphysics through our correct predictions both in [politics](/social/cycles/predictions) and [economics](/social/supersociology/precrisis-years). We are already testing our points-based economic system to solve the current stagflation, something that Economics has no solution for. So no worries with those. 

But we still need to prove that Bio Superphysics and Material Superphysics also work by using the aether to  increase crop yield (as 'Maximized Farming'), cure diseases, realize fusion, levitation, and teleportation (actions at a distance).

Medicine is highly regulated. Material experiments are expensive. We aim to surmount both impediments through our economic system.

This is why, until 2030, most of our work is on Social Superphysics as economics and policies. The work on Bio and Material Superphysics will mostly be theoretical for now, though we've done [rudimentary experiments on levitation](/material/levitation) and preventing cancers from getting worse via alternative medicine.

<!-- In the past, Material Superphysics was proven by miracles such as Jesus walking on water or Buddhist monks levitating. But this was not replicable. So we use Tesla's spacetime priniples which are opposite those of Einstein's General Relativity.  -->
