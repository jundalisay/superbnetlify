Adam Smith would be against Brexit because the European Union (EU) is an internal free trade zone and Britain derives a lot of benefits from it.

However, this does not mean that Smith would be pro-EU. This is because while there is free trade within it, there are oppressive regulations and subsidies that make it hard for outsiders and outside trade to penetrate fortress Europe.

Rather, Smith would be for a World Union (WU) where all countries have free trade and immigration with each other.

Brexit deregulates Britain, increasing inequality in the future.
