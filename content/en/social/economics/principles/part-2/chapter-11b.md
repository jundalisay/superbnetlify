<!-- We bring back the models of Classical economics to replace those created by modern economics of the Industrial Revolution. The models above come from actual economic data and are not merely theoretical. When combined with data science, these new models gain a predictive ability that is lacking in Economics. In 2015, our model correctly predicted a long crisis sparking in 2019 which turned out to be Covid -->

Superphysics is our revival of Classical Economics, backed up by actual data which is visualized through data science and analytics. This data spans 2,500 years, from Xenophon's The Economist up to the latest GDP data. 

In contrast, Modern Economics only began from the Marginal Revolution of the 1870's. This makes it a toy idea that crashed quickly after 50 years as the Great Crash and Depression. Nowadays, this toy idea manifests as gaming via game theory, the stock market, and cryptocurrencies, all coming from the mercantile game of buying low and selling high.

## The Huge Knowledge Gap in Economics

Economics creates crises because of the huge gaps in knowledge about the nature of society and the self, since it only had 150 years of data on human behavior. An easy proof of the limitation of Economics is the Law of Supply is Demand is taught, but not [the Four Laws of Value](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-03/) that lead to that Law of Supply and Demand

In contrast, Superphysics has over 2,500 years of knowledge from principles and data collected by philosophers before they were converted into scientists or researchers
