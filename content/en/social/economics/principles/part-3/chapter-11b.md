> Summary: We define Capitalism as an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits.

A major topic of debate among economists is whether Adam Smith was a proponent of capitalism.

We argue that he was not, simply because his core ideas are very different from those of capitalism, which is merely mercantilism with superficial changes. The source of the confusion is the unclear definition of the word 'capitalism'. The most [concise definition](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp) is:

{{< quote >}}
An economic system based on the private ownership of capital to produce goods and services for profit.
{{< /quote >}}

Based on this defintion, can we conclusively answer if the following are capitalist?


Entity | Is it Capitalist?
--- | ---
A baker who grows his own wheat, employs a few assistants, and bakes his own bread to be sold for profit | According to the definition, Yes.
A corporation that is unable to make any profits or just breaks even for a long time | Yes, since the profit intention is there
A holding company or shell company that produces nothing | No, since nothing is produced
A day-trader who uses his own money to buy stocks in the morning and sell in the afternoon for profit | No, since nothing is produced
A long-term investor that uses his money to buy and hold stocks in a company that sells products profitably | Yes. All criteria are met
A corporation that makes profits but gives it all back to society | Yes because the motive was there, but no since the profits were lost


Obviously, the above is not a clear definition of capitalism since we do not regard the bakers of 1,000 years ago as capitalists, and the shell companies of today as non-capitalists. 

To get a clear definition*, we follow David Hume's method of breaking down the compound idea of capitalism into its basic parts. The five basic ideas in it are:

1. private ownership
2. capital
3. production
4. goods & services
5. profit

> *We must define everything because our goal is to [automate the running of the economy](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah) to make it as efficient as possible

We remove the capital*, production, goods & services, as they are common to every economic system. How else can goods & services exist other than by production through capital? 

> *Smith defines capital as anything that produces value and is not used for final consumption. He divides it into fixed capital (such as a singer's lovely voice) and circulating capital (such as gasoline for a taxi, with the taxi service being the final consumption)


Thus, private ownership and profit remain as the noteworthy basic ideas possibly unique to capitalism.



## Private Ownership?

Private ownership alone cannot be capitalism's defining characteristic since feudal lands and even a whole country like North Korea can be said to be under private ownership of their rulers, yet are still able to produce goods. 

This leaves us with **the profit motive** as its possible defining characteristic. This is strengthened by the fact that rulers earn revenue from rent as taxes, and not from the profits of buying and selling.


{{< img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/a0155bc65a21c8ad73c5235b78814c1a-genghis-khan-horde.jpg" alt="Mongol leader" cap="Rulers such as Genghis Khan and the Arab Muslims earned by taxing the people directly (as jizya) and not by commerce" >}}


However, the problem with this is that the profit motive also defines mercantilism. 

Merchants in the 18th century lobbied for tariffs, exclusive privileges, and subsidies in order to get higher profits from commerce. The businessmen of the 17th century set up mercantile companies to profit from the production of tea and opium in India, just as Apple funded factories in China to produce iPhones to take advantage of price differences. Then and now, this massive profiteering can only be done through big business organizations.

<!-- Thus, those pro-business regulations were merely the effects, and the profit motive was the cause. This is why Adam Smith wrote so much against such regulations which enriched the few and impoverished the poor. Unfortunately, those businessmen found a champion in Paul Samuelson who corrupted Smith's words to appear that he was totally anti-regulation. -->

In Book 5 of The Wealth of Nations, corporations or firms were known as joint stock companies which were big business organizations that ran on the same basic ideas:

Joint stock company (Book 5, Chap. 1) | Corporation or firm
--- | ---
Trade on a joint stock, on a large capital | Trade on a common or preferred stock representing a large capital
Each member shares in the common profit or loss in proportion to his share | Stockholder's liability is limited to his stock investment
Members can transfer shares, introduce new members without the company’s consent | People can buy and transfer shares of publicly listed companies
The value of a share is always its market price and is different from the stated value | Stock price can be different from the IPO price or par value
The joint stock company is always managed by a court of directors | The corporation is managed by executives under a CEO
The court of directors is under a court of proprietors who do not understand the company's business | The CEO is managed by a board of directors from various backgrounds



## Mercantilism = Capitalism (Sort of)

This sameness of essence between capitalism and mercantilism is proven by the fact that Capitalism's producers and Mercantilism's merchants actually form a single sub-order of society which live by profits:

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
Merchants and master manufacturers are the two classes in this order who employ the largest capitals... Their thoughts and judgement commonly revolve around the interest of their own business,than around the interest of society.
<cite>Simple Wealth of Nations, Book 1</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


But different words exist only to express different ideas. Even if the basic idea of capitalism and mercantilism are the same, there must have been a secondary basic idea to differentiate them. Otherwise, they could've been used interchangeably, just as the words 'automobile' and 'car' mean the exact same thing. <!-- No one will be confused by 'ride my automobile' and 'ride my car'. But we cannot say 'you are a capitalist' and 'you are a mercantilist' to a person who trades stocks.  -->

To find this secondary idea, we retrace our steps back to 'private ownership' to see if there is any difference in the idea of private ownership in mercantilism and private ownership in capitalism.


### Outside Private Ownership

The main difference between mercantilism and capitalism is the prevalence of private regulated companies in the former and their lack in the latter. The most significant characteristic of private regulated companies is their exclusivity, similar to guilds of the past.

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
The object of most of the bylaws of all regulated companies and all other corporations, is not so much to oppress existing members. Its object is more to discourage others from becoming members... The directors of a regulated company, haveno common capital to manage.They have no other fund to use for forts and garrisons other than the casual revenue from: the admission fines, the corporation duties.
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 5</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

Thus, in terms of private ownership, mercantilism limits private outside ownership in big, for-profit organizations. This makes it more exclusive but at the disadvantage of having smaller capital. Capitalism, on the other hand, allows anyone to be an owner. This looseness and freedom of ownership leads to big capitalby allowing a lot of resources to be pooled. Thus, **we say that 'equity' is the cause of a very obvious effect of big capital, which we speculate to have led to its naming as 'capitalism'**.



## Capitalism: Born Between 1800-1830 

<!-- Let's compare our definition with the historical definition:  -->

Capitalism's birth in England and/or France can be narrowed down to after Smith's death in 1790 to before 1830 when its idea was already written about, as explained by Marx:

{{< quote ava="marx" >}}
Gustav von Gülich in his "Historical description of Commerce, Industry,"..in 1830, has examined at length the historical circumstances that prevented, in Germany, the development of the capitalist mode of production.. Thus the soil whence Political Economy springs was wanting. This "science" had to be imported from England and Franceas a ready-made article.. Since 1848 capitalist production has developed rapidly in Germany, and at the present time it is in the full bloom of speculation and swindling.
<cite>Marx, Capital, Preface, emphasis added</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

Capitalism failed to take root in Germany and most other places, but took root in Britain because of the high degree of freedom that the British enjoyed, together with the strong support by their government. The Netherlands and the Hanseatic league had weaker government support which prevented their mercantilism from evolving into capitalism. In fact, Thomas Mun wrote that the Dutch owed their commercial wealth to the British who empowered them to counteract the strength of Spain:

{{< quote >}}
The Dutch Author of Mare Liberum cannot entitle the Dutch to fish in His Majesty's Seas.. But I am not saying that the Dutch should not be allowed to catch and carry them away from there without His Majesties licence. The fishing rights might be a good policy to keep them in league with England and in war against Spain.
<cite>England's Treasure on Foreign Trade</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


From Britain, the seed ideas of modern capitalism went to France, as seen in JB Say, a French businessman and proto-capitalist, who wrote *A Treatise on Political Economy (1803)*. However, the single idea that sparked the growth of those seed ideas was James Mill who, in *Elements of Political Economy (1821)*, defined a capitalist as someone who owns the produce of the work of others, without actually working himself :

{{< quote ava="mill" >}}
In this sense of the term "owners of labour," the parties, concerned about production, are divided into two classes, that ofcapitalists, the rich men who supply the materials and instruments of production; and that of the workmen, who supply the labour.
<cite>Mill, Chapter 1, Section 2</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


{{< img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jmillj.jpg" alt="James Mill" cap="James Mill (1773-1836), creator of modern capitalism, was a friend of Jeremy Bentham, a liberal" >}}


Note that in this sense,capitalist can only apply if the workers are **ACTUALLY SLAVES**:

{{< quote ava="mill" >}}
The labourer, who receives wages, sells his labour for a day.. The manufacturer, who pays these wages, buys the labour for the day..He is equally therefore the owner of the labour, with the manufacturer who operates with slaves.. the capitalist is the owner of both instruments of production: and the whole of the produce is his.
<cite>Elements of Political Economy Chapter 1, section 2, emphasis added</cite>
{{< /quote >}}



### Both Communism and Capitalism Enslave Humans

Communism lets the state enslave man, whereas Capitalism lets the capital owners do it

Thus, in modern capitalism (Mill's capitalism), workers are actually slaves in essence, different from the capitalism of Turgot, Say, and Ricardo. 

All of the work done by an employee in a modern company belongs to that company's owners in exchange for a fixed wage. This is different from the original capitalism where the workers were paid by the piece or had profit sharing in co-partneries. It was Mill that corrupted the word 'capitalist', equating it more to 'owner of someone else's work' instead of the proper classical definition of 'someone who lives by profits,' as used by Smith and the Physiocrats. Thus, **Capitalism is from Mill and not Smith**. 

So we can say the socio-economic freedom espoused by Smith was destroyed by this idea from Mill. Smith's system gave importance to all three classes of rent-earners, wage-earners, and profit-earners, whereas Mill only gave importance to the profit earners. This injustice, in turn, became fuel for Marx to attack Mill's ideas which were by then more fully developed by his son John Stuart Mill:

![Office Work](https://res.cloudinary.com/nara/image/upload/q_auto/office-work-slave_wcylhq.png)

{{< quote ava="marx" >}}
Men who still claimed some scientific standing and aspired to be something more than mere sophists and sycophants of the ruling classes tried to harmonise the Political Economy of capital with the claims..of the proletariat. Hence a shallow syncretism of which John Stuart Mill is the best representative. Under these circumstances its professors fell into two groups. The prudent, practical business folk, flocked to the banner of Bastiat, the most superficial..representative of the apologetic of vulgar economy; the other.. followed John Stuart Mill in his attempt to reconcile irreconcilables.*
<cite>Marx, Capital, Preface</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

> *Note that 'reconciling irreconcilables' was also more recently done by Paul Samuelson in his 'neo-classical synthesis'.

Marx' main description of capitalism as a system where resources are amassed through centralization for private gain is consistent with our definition of a system of pooling resources together through equity, or shares of stocks:

{{< quote ava="marx" >}}
Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. This is centralisation proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration. ..accumulation..is a very slow process as compared with centralisation.. The world would still be without railroads, if it had been obliged to wait until accumulation.. enabled a few individual capitals to undertake the construction of a railroad. Centralisation, on the other hand, accomplished this by a turn of the hand throughstock companies.
<cite>Marx, Capital, Preface, emphasis added</cite>
{{< /quote >}} 

Nowadays, almost anyone can own stocks and some people, like pensioners and insurance buyers, don't even know that they are indirectly owning stocks, and are getting a steady revenue from the work of others without working themselves. More obviously, the most common buzz in today's business news are stock prices, proving the importance of equity to capitalism. Turn on CNBC and Bloomberg and you will see stock information everywhere. If the world had stayed in mercantilism, then commodity prices would be shown instead.


{{< img alt="Stock price ticker" cap="Stocks and stock prices are inseparable from modern capitalism just as commodities and commodity prices were inseparable from mercantilism" src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/fm50.jpg" >}}


## The Basic Supereconomic Definition of Capitalism

With these ideas of centralization, private gain, and the ownership of other people's work, we can thus define capitalism in simple terms as **an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits**.

It is through the ownership of stock by people outside or unrelated to the company's operations that they get rich through the accumulation of profits via retained earnings and rising stock prices for the benefit of their selves. By simply making the right bet, a stock trader or investor can multiply his small money into big money without doing much work, just like a gambler. 

This is one of the main expedients that fuels inequality, as it allows people to feed off the work of others legally. When left unchecked, it allows people to increase their nominal value way above their real value. This manifests as bubbles which pop when the nominal value crashes back to its real, natural value. 

<!-- ) which lead to recessions or depressions, best seenafter 1929 . -->

State capitalism is the state trying to solve the problem of inequality by giving the government the control of private equity so that its profits can be better distributed to society. However, such a system requires its government administrators to have a high degree of skill and morals to juggle private and public interest at the same time. Adam Smith says that the government can be in business as long as its people are responsible. This is proven by the success of China's state-owned corporations:

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
Government management of mercantile projects like this requires orderly, vigilant, and parsimonious administration, like those in Venice and Amsterdam. But the government of England was never famous for good economy. In peacetime, she has been slothful and negligently profuse. This is perhaps natural to monarchies.
<cite>The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 5, Chapter 2</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

A well-run state capitalism* leads to less opportunities for private capitalism. This is why liberals say that governments have no business to be in business. They cherry-pick quotes from the Wealth of Nations to advocate deregulation and laissez faire, contrary to the original spirit of the book.

The success of state-made vaccines such as Sinopharm of China and Sputnik V of Russia prove that governments can be in business if they are responsible enough

From here we can add other definitions:

- Inclusive capitalism is an economic system that uses outside ownership to let everyone amass private profits, likely through penny stocks or group purchase
- Stakeholder capitalism is an economic system that uses outside ownership to let its stakeholders have a share in the profits of the company or system
- Shareholder capitalism is wrong because it is redundant


Our definition distinguishes capitalism from mercantilism and answers the questions earlier:

Capitalist | Not Capitalist
--- | ---
A long-term investor who uses his money to buy and hold stocks in a company that sells products profitably | A baker who employs his own assistants and bakes his own bread for profit
A company, owned by 'silent' partners, that is unable to make any profits or just breaks even for a long time | A corporation that makes profits but gives it all back to society
A holding company or shell company that produces nothing | A day trader who uses his own money to buy stocks or commodities in the morning and sell it in the afternoon for profit is a merchant or speculator, not a capitalist
A government that creates a government-corporation by inviting private equity | A government that creates a government-company by issuing bonds


By defining capitalism, we can better filter out the economic policies that enslave people and we can adopt those that set them free. The next task is to define outside equity, which will be discussed in future posts.
