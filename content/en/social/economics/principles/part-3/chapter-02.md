## Inflation

Demand-pull money-price Inflation - prices rise because of excessive demand

Cost-push money-price Inflation - prices rise because of increased costs

The USD is like training wheels for world trade. It's essential to get started with trade, but after humans learn to trade, they can get rid of it to maximize trade. 


## Stores of Value

Fair Exchange relies on a common store of value to be the basis of that fairness. 

Here we explain the store of that value which is the objectification done by the mind for the sake of processing that idea of value. We divide this store as commodity-based and non commodity-based. 


## Non-Commodities 

### Contracts and Promises 

A common example is a marriage contract. 

### Land Titles

Land Titles are the foundation of property and government, something that is part of a civilized nation. 

### Securities 

Securities store up the work done for an non-government type of organization. It can only exist in a civilized nation. 

### Abstract Points

These are abstract rewards such as brownie points or karma points. An example is a star that a child receives from his teacher. 


## Commodities 

### Goods and Things


### Money 

Money comes from the Latin *moneta* which means mint, which is the act of converting metal into coins. 

Currency is money that is the current medium of exchange. For example, an online game might use credits as its in-game currency. 

A money becomes legal tender if the government allows it to be used for payments, including the payment of taxes and the settlement of debts.


### Fiat Money

#### Cryptocurrency

El Salvador is an example of a country that has legalized Bitcoin, making it a legal tender.
