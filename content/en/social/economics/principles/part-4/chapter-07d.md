## Hunter-Gatherer Scenario

This scenario illustrates the DCTI model in the simplest form without trade. To meet the hunger (demand) of the hunter, he must gather his equipment and skill (capital) to hunt an animal (industry), which he will consume to satisfy his hunger.


## Advancing Society Scenario

It starts with fixed capital (light blue bar), unlike the hunter-gatherer scenario which had none. The circulating capitals are then added:
- new skills, new equipment, division of labor, etc are represented by the light green bar
- labor, raw materials, finished products, money are the dark blue bar

The light green bar on slide 14 represents value that is in excess of what is needed to maintain fixed capital.


<!-- ## Debt Scenario

Let us create a town scenario wherein a baker sees a daily demand for cakes but, naturally, is unsure of the exact kind, quantity, or price demanded by the market. Nevertheless, he follows his dharma and uses his own capital, made up of 1 unit of oven rental at $1, 1 unit of ingredients at $1, and 1 unit of his own skill at $1 (which represents his desired wage and profit), to bake one cake which he will use to enter the market to sell at a natural price of $3 (Figure 3A). We assume, like most businesses, that his first attempt to sell it will be a failure. His failure, however, will give him new insights on the effectual demand of the market. Keeping with his dharma, he tries again in a new iteration, borrowing $2 to replenish his capital and modifying the cake to meet the effectual demand. This time we assume he successfully sells his cake, earning enough to replenish his capital and reduce his debt by $1 (Figure 3B).

Every economy, regardless of paradigm, has the factors of demand, value (capital with industry), and trade which are balanced and spread naturally by human action. The more freedom and justice a society has, the faster the spread and balancing is, reflecting human dynamism. The lesser both are, the more barbaric the balancing becomes, unearthing the instincts of our animalistic past. 

In Capitalist systems, excesses are balanced by crashes while shortages are balanced by demonstrations and riots. In authoritarian or Communist systems where freedom is almost non-existent, excesses are balanced by stagnation while shortages are balanced by revolution, civil war, or an exodus.
