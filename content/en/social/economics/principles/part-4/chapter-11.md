## The Demands of Communism

Karl Marx and Frederick Engels listed the 10 demands of Communism in The Communist Manifesto: 

1. Abolition of [capitalist] property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State
  - The cultivation of waste-lands
  - The improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
8. Equal liability of all to work. 
  - Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries
  - Gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.
10. Free education for all children in public schools.
  - Abolition of childrenâ€™s factory labour in its present form.
  - Combination of education with industrial production, etc.


Marx and Engels believed that such policies would concentrate production into the hands of the State. This would then make the public power will lose its political character and make class distinctions will disappear, to be replaced instead by association. 

Our law of social cycles says that humans, by the design of Nature, fall under 4 large classes:

1. Workers
2. Warriors
3. Thinkers
4. Traders

Removing such distinctions would therefore be going against Nature. This is why Communist systems imploded naturally by themselves. 


<!-- Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the capitalists is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. -->

<!-- Classes will be replaced by association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all. -->
