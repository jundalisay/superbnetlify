There are 2 ways for governments to fund themselves:

1. Tax Revenue

2. Non-Tax Revenue

This includes:
- revenue from assets, like a fund that earns interest
- government land that earns rent
- revenue from state owned enterprises

<!-- Because governments form a much smaller part of any society, the revenue from taxation is naturally higher. Here, we organize Smith's chapters on taxation for easier understanding. -->

Taxes can be classified into the following:

1. Fees
2. Taxes on Revenue

The taxes on revenue are applied on the 4 kinds of revenue:

## Taxes on Rent

## Taxes on Profit

Capital Gains and Inheritance taxes

Profit (revenue from stock and freelance or one-off labour
- Sales Taxes
- Excise Taxes
- Value-added taxes

## Taxes on Wages

Income Taxes (revenue from labour)



<!-- Taxes that vary based on revenue: Article 1-3: Land, Rent, and revenue 

from land value or the produce of the land ( -->

<!-- Taxes that do not vary: Article 4: Capitation Taxes (Poll Taxes) and  -->

<!-- Sales Taxes (necessities vs luxuries) -->

Sales taxes were created to tax income via the people's expenses because:
- It was hard to know each person's income
- It was unfair to tax everyone an equal amount

"A tax on necessities operates the same way as a direct tax on wages."
Luxuries should be taxed.

The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.

Taxes on necessities, such as energy, creates an easy form of revenue for governments and may be continued.

There are 2 ways to charge sales taxes:

1. By an annual payment for expensive, durable items
Instead of a big tax payment, the charge is spread over many years

2. By charging the seller just before the item is sold to the consumer (customs and excise duties)

High import duties create smuggling and fraud

High taxes give less revenue than small taxes

Sir Walpole suggested a taxation system for wine and tobacco similar to Smith's suggestions

Liquor taxes (taxing malt vs taxing beer)
Other Taxes that do not vary:
Tolls and fees
Taxes on luxuries

<!-- How we apply Smith's system

We implement Smith's forgotten system through our internet-based resource allocation (SORA) system by charging sales taxes directly on each party in a transaction and by categorizing all taxes as either income taxes or sales taxes. The income taxes are direct taxes which include all revenue from land, labor, and stock, while sales taxes are also direct taxes on items that circulate in the economy.
 -->


Income taxes - Property tax, Estate tax, Capital Gains tax, Income taxes, Profit taxes.


Sales taxes - Sales tax, VAT, Sin taxes, Customs and Excise Duties

In the current economic system, a 10% sales tax is passed on the buyer to be given and paid by the seller to the government. In our proposed system, taxes are divided equally between the parties in the trade. This makes the taxation on countertrade easier and more transparent. Here, the 10% taxes is divided into 5% and applied on both parties.
