The lockdowns during Covid and the war between Russia and Ukraine have caused both food and fertilizers to be inaccessible. This in turn has caused food prices to increase worldwide. 

This has led to nutrition deficiency among the poor, as well as slow growth in the food service and food processing industry. 


## The Global Food Inflation Proves Market Liberalization is Flawed

According to the doctrine of free markets of Modern Economics, the inflation of oil and food prices should attract capital to the oil industry or renewables, as well as to food production or distribution. These would then create competition and reduce prices. 

However, in reality, additional capital merely gravitated towards the monopolistic causes of the inflation -- the big agribusinesses and big distributors, which we will call the 'whales'. 

The whales then probe the limits of the market and the government by playing with prices until they find a sustainable high price that is very advantageous to them, yet not extremely oppressive as to create a revolution or change in policy.

<!-- In the case of the Philippines, the whales chose to strike early at the start of the term of the new President, Bong Bong Marcos, who has a 6-year term starting on June 30, 2022. In this way, they will have high revenues for 6 years unless the government is changed by a coup or revolution. 

Accordingly, the threat of a military destabilization cropped up after just 6 months in the second week of January 2023.  -->


## Solution: A New Agricultural Paradigm

To solve the problems caused by the lack of fertilizers, Biosuperphysics introduced a new paradigm called *Maximized Agriculture* which focused on native varieties, crop combinations, organic fertilizers, and maximized land use. While industrial agriculture uses matter as its main principle, Maximized Agriculture uses the aether. 

Agricultural Supereconomics implements Maximized Farming as agricultural policy. Unlike Agriculture Economics which only deals with market prices and supply and demand of agricultural products, it deals with the human needs, labor requirements, and the natural dynamics of plant and animal societies.
