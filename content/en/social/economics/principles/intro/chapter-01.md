Buying and selling are rooted in waves of desires, which manifest objectively as "prices-particles". 

This is similar to a subjective beauty contest being decided by objective "beauty-points" from the judges, with the winner having the higher points.

<!-- The ideas of GDP, Inflation, and Wealth then all extend from prices.  -->

**Supereconomics** is the branch of Social Superphysics that deals with the changing waves of demand (first law) in order to match it (fourth law) to the existing or potential supply (second law) as quickly as possible through economic tools (third law) like money, contracts, taxation, etc.


 <!-- social contracts and pool clearing. -->


## Ideas are Particles, Feelings are Waves

Superphysics is a paradigm that sees the universe as being made up of subjective waves, manifesting as objective particles. This is different from science* which prefers particles over waves.

> *The scientific paradigm seems to be changing, as proven by electrons nowadays being regarded as a probability ‘cloud’ instead of as a material point.

We apply Superphysics in the context of society, as Social Superphysics, by equating ideas into price-particles, and desires into feeling-waves. 

In Superphysics, particles are static, while waves are dynamic. Prices change in a market or economy, because the feelings and desires of the people change. 
- At one time, they might collectively agree that $10 is the price of a commodity.
- At another time, they might agree that $100 is its new price.   

This collective agreement is due to the fact that each person or soul identifies into a larger abstract-person or soul called a society. The collective or average of all prices of that commodity in the world will lead to a global price according to the view of the global society. This global price is therefore the real price, a concept that does not exist in Economics, and is discussed in Part 2.    


<!-- Since particles are static, then it follows that ideas are static. When you get an idea, it is really your mind moving towards that static idea through the action of thinking. The thinking action then comes from a desire to think. 

This means that feeling-waves are dynamic and that the entire universe gets its motion from the feelings of Its Creator.

Unlike Economics that believes that economic activity is based on supply, Supereconomics believes that demand, as feeling-waves, is the cause. 

> *Update Jan 2022: Our correct prediction of the 2020 stagflation is proof of this. 

<!--  as a global stagflation* is based on the metaphysical supposition that  ultimately based on demand, which is then based on desire as feeling-waves. Since an economy has the desires of many people, then we call the gross economic demand as the collective wave of human desire. 

<!-- |  in order to explain how we came up with the prediction of a crisis either as a global stagflation or global depression, which is ultimately based on the metaphysical notion that history repeats itself or that everything in the universe has a cyclical nature, since the whole universe is made up of waves which pulsate, or have highs and lows.

## The Metaphysics of Waves of Desire and Macroeconomic Cycles

Since Supereconomics deals with the quenching of demand arising from the constant waves of desire, then it sees unfulfilled desires as problems to be solved. These manifest the most during recessions, inflation, unemployment, etc. 

The increase in economic problems since the 2008 Financial Crisis prove that Economics is impotent in solving such problems. Its inability arises from its ignorance of the proper metaphysics, something that Supereconomics has in its core as Superphysics.

This introductory part will explain all the metaphysical bases which will be embodied in the Four Laws of Exchangeable Value, which in turn is the easy-to-understand foundation of Supereconomics.  

<!--  so that we can build more stable socio-economic systems. By looking at the movement of commodity prices we can say that peaks in prices are represent a time of high desire for that commodity and troughs as a time of low desire*.

> *This is fully explained in [the Metaphysics of Prices](/social/economics/principles/four-laws-of-value)

Sometimes you want a thing, sometimes you don't. But normally, your number of desires increase through time, unless you are going towards the end of your life, when the energy to achieve desires seem to wane.

However, since the 2008 financial crisis, the global economy has not risen as fast as before, which means that the collective desire of humans has not risen, which then contradicts its natural behavior. You'd expect that the global economy would be booming since oil prices are low. Therefore, there must be something artificial that is hindering the natural desires of humans.

For example, through the Four Laws of Value, we can see how the profit maximization doctrine, espoused by Mercantilism, Capitalism, and Modern Economics, creates the systemic crises from the 1772 Credit Crunch up to the 2008 Financial Crisis.
