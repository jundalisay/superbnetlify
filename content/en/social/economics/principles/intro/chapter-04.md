<!-- Economic Superphysics explains socio-economics, as the combined dynamics of society and its economy, from the perspective of the four laws of value. 
 -->


Suppose Barry and Adam are walking at a commercial street. They see a cake at a bakery, and an iguana at the pet store next to it. 


{{< img src="/photos/objects/cake.jpg" alt="Cake slice">}}

  
Barry might not see value in the cake, but Adam might, as he might want it for his wife's birthday tomorrow. 

The value of the cake to Adam comes from:
- the inherent nature of their culture* to impose gift-giving during birthdays, and
- the inherent nature of the cake as a kind of birthday gift, arising from the culture.  
<!--    dharma or tao (nature) of
- the tao (nature) of the cake as being a kind of gift.  -->

> *This includes the culture of givine importance to birthdays. The nature of culture is explained by Social Superphysics, as being part of the common interest.


In contrast, the iguana does not have an inherent nature of being a gift. This is why Adam would not assign a value to an iguana. Adam would only assign a value to Iguana if his wife were an Iguana-lover (had the inherent nature of loving iguanas). In this case, he might ignore the cake and inquire about the iguana.

<!-- This tao is not present in Mr. A and so he sees no value in the cake.   -->

Thus, **value is always relativistic depending on the inherent nature of many things**:
- Adam
- Adam's wife
- Adam's wife having a birthday event
- Adam's culture imposing the need to give gifts during birthday events

The value of an iguana or a cake to Adam would depend on:

1. The social pressure* to give gifts during birthdays. We can call this the 'cultural value'
2. Adam's love for his wife. We call this 'sentimental value'
3. His wife's need for a gift, whether it be the cake or the iquana. We call this the useful value or 'use-value' 

> *This social pressure is needed to keep the society whole. 


Unlike Economics, Supereconomics, as a subset of Superphysics, takes into account cultural value and sentimental value. There are other values like environmental value, historical value, moral value, etc. which will be explained in future editions.  


## Use-Value

In Neoclassical Economics, the use-value is called 'utility' and is the foundation of its theories like marginal utility.


{{< box >}}
### Marginal Utility

According to Economics, utility is the satifaction that you get from a good or service.

Initially, this satisfaction increases with every additional item bought. But in time, your satisfaction from the item increases in smaller amounts until it no longer increases.

<!-- At this point, you say you have all the items that you need.  -->

If you get more, then it might cause dissatisfaction, which is negative satifaction. At such a point, you stop buying. 

This concept requires the quantification of pleasure or utility, which is then ‘maximized’ as ‘profit maximization’ which is a major  fallacy perpetrated by Economics and is the cause of poverty, inequality, and economic crises. 
{{< /box >}}

<!--  to the general society and the personal self, just as energy has a general and special relativity.  -->

Superphysics disregards marginal utility because utility is subjective. Each person gets a different level of satisfaction at every good or service, and so it would be wrong to create a rigid, objective model for dynamic, subjective utility. 

This error manifests as investors denying investments to sectors, industries, or goods and services that do not fit their own utility models (i.e. meet the direct return-on-investment, or ROI, that they want). This then causes economies to regularly stagnate, and even decline, due to the decline of those underinvested sectors or industries. 

Instead of marginal utility, Superphysics uses **minimum requirements**, explained in Chapter 5, and **the grain index**, explained in Chapter 8.  These concepts will let people spend and invest for the essential sectors or industries of the economy, whether it is profitable or not. In this way, those sectors will remain capitalized and functioning. This will then prevent price shocks or externalities that grow into crises which harm the sustainability of the socio-economy.

<!-- This value is called **use-value** or  in Economics. Superphysics allows sentimental value, but since the mechanism to objectively compare sentiments is not yet established*, we shall stick to use-value. 


> *We're working on that too -->


## Exchangeable Value as Societal Worth
<!-- Purchase Versus Buying -->


In our example, a cake gets value because of the nature of:
- Adam's love for his wife
- his wife's birthday
- the culture of giving cakes during birthdays

All these factors go into the value of the cake which Adam thinks of as the cake's worth:

Source | Value
--- | ---
Love for wife | Sentimental Value
Giving cakes or gifts on birthdays | Cultural Value
The usefulness of cakes to his wife | Use Value


These 3 make up the exchangeable value of the cake in a society. Outside of society, only use-value and sentimental value would exist. 

Use-value often is opposite in worth than exchangeable value. For example:
- diamonds have little use-value, but have a high exchangeable value because it is rare
- water has high use-value, but has low exchangeable value because it is plentiful

This difference arises from the difference between the nature of:
- the self-entity, here use-value dominates
- the society-entity, here exchangeable-value dominates

### The Paradox of Value in Economics Leading to Sinister Profit Maximization

Economics uses the difference between use-value and nominal exchangeable value to create a non-problem called the "paradox" of value.

This paradox states that water is essential to life and has a high use-value, but is nominally cheap. Diamonds, on the other hand, are nominally expensive but have low use-value. So economists create the concept of marginal utility to "solve" the paradox.

Marginal utility says that the frequent consumption of an item, such as water, reduces the utility or use-value of that item. Therefore, to make it more valuable, its consumption should be limited. For example, if we drink 4 liters of water everyday, then we will appreciate water twice more if we only had 2 liters daily. This would then raise its use-value and subsequently its nominal exchangable value to be more like diamonds.

This then leads to its child concept called **utility or profit maximization** that would urge us to sell this scarce water to get more nominal revenue and riches for ourselves. We should find a sweet spot via maximization wherein we can cut the supply of water to give us higher revenues, but not too much that it would kill our market (by dying from thirst, for example).

All of this is morally absurd, yet this is what Economic Calculus teaches. This can be seen most commonly in the prices of oil, utilities, medical services, and real estate which everyone needs. To Adam Smith and Superphysics, use-value should not be compared to exchangeable value just as apples should not be compared to oranges. This is because use-value is personal while exchangeable value is social. Without the comparison, no paradox is created and no profit maximization, artificial scarcity, and social suffering is created for personal gain.

<!--   use-value is determined by the wife's need or want to receive a cake on her birthday. The subjective use-value is therefore the most critical part of the value of the cake. -->

Within society, Adam can get the cake in 2 ways:

1. By asking for it as a donation
2. By offering something for it in exchange


<!-- But Adam normally cannot come up to the baker and simply ask for the cake. --> 

Adam can ask for the cake as a donation by appealing to the baker's benevolence. Donations and grants were more common in the ancient times:

{{< q >}}
The disciple Yen-Yu applied for some grain on behalf of his mother. 

<p>Confucius: Give her 3 pecks.</p>

He applied for more. 

<p>Confucius: Give her 8, then.</p>

Yen-Yu gave his mother 50 times that amount.
<cite>The Analects Simplified, Chapter 2</cite>
{{< /q >}}



In modern times, donations have been overshadowed by money-purchases. In the interest of economic justice, Adam has to give something to the baker in return.

This sense of economic justice prevents Adam from stealing the cake, and in turn comes from the sense of common interest. Without the common interest in the minds of the people, economic crime has a chance of happening. 

In a society, the following exchanges occur:

- "Purchase" is the the acquisition of something by exchange. 
- "Barter" is a purchase by exchanging goods or services. A barter transaction thus has 2 purchasers. 
- "Buying" is a purchase by offering money. The giver of the money is called the "buyer". Since he receives goods and services, he is also called a purchaser. 
- "Selling" is the act of giving goods or services by getting money in return. The giver is called the "seller". 
- "Commerce" is a regular purchasing or buying-selling activity. 

**Exchangeable value** which has 4 types depending on perspective:

Price | Perspective | Scope
--- | --- | ---
1 Nominal Price | Buyer | Personal
2 Real Price | Seller | Personal
3 Market Price | Seller | Social
4 Natural Price | Seller | Social



<!-- Presenting: The Four Economies
Mar 14, 2019 · 4 min read

In a previous post, I explained the Ideology Matrix which classifies ideas based on its selfishness (ego) or unselfishness (non-ego), and objectiveness or non-objectiveness.

In this post, we will apply it on economic systems so that we can properly divide or compartmentalize any economy so that it will be easier to build or troubleshoot. This is similar to how cars have a transmission system, electrical system, suspension system, etc. and how the human body has a nervous system, digestive system, reproductive system, etc. This division helps in specialization so that an electrician can work on a car’s electrical issues and a physical therapist can work on a person’s muscular problems, leading to faster repair or healing.
Applying our matrix onto economic systems creates four logical divisions which we call the four economies:
Abstract or Subjective small-scale: we call this the personal economy (from Greek this roughly translates to personal home management)
Abstract or Subjective large-scale: we call this the social economy (the management of the homes of everyone taken together)
Tangible or Objective small-scale: we call this the micro economy (or small house management)
Tangible or Objective large-scale: we call this the macro economy (large house management)
Note that the first two refer to home, an abstract concept, while the latter two refer to house, a physical thing. Note also that while Economics only deals with the physical objective aspects of resource allocation, SORAnomics deals with the psychological and emotional aspects, because it is rooted in metaphysics or moral philosophy*.


The four economies are based on the direction of the metaphysical human mind within physical reality, with regard to physical resources. Its goal is to strike a balance, or for minds to have a well-rounded direction in maintaining its physical existence (i.e. to not endanger the existence of other entities that want to share in the experience of that physical reality)
*Moral Philosophy was a branch that was heavily espoused by the European Enlightenment (from roughly 1600 to 1800 AD) and Asian Enlightenment (Buddha, Mahavira, Lao Tzu from 600 to 400 BC, also roughly 200 years). It was neglected during the material-loving Industrial revolution that created dialectical materialism (leading to communism) and utilitarianism (leading to neoliberalism), among others. We use home and house to represent the metaphysical and physical aspects of societies respectively.
When the element of time and our grain index is applied to the four economies of a society, we get a map of its economic social cycle:


The economic social cycles show how society-organisms try to find balance in the physical world to maintain their physical existence. A society might find balance after a hundred years of struggle, only for that balance to be dislodged by a foreign society.
This economic social cycle can then shed light on a society’s general social cycle which can then help predict the events that will happen in each society. (Recall that we view a society as a metaphysical organism made of a collection of metaphysical souls bound by allegiance or willful subordination or reduced ego)

Since Economics was built as a science of the industrial revolution, it focuses only on objective aspects, most commonly using money as the measure of the goodness or badness of an economy. It has no moral philosophy to back it up, or any way to predict social movements, very different from the original political economy which was based on legal studies and moral philosophy*.
*David Hume correctly said that laws are based on morals and morals are based on feelings and not on reason). The lack of moral philosophy since then had resulted in world wars, externalities, environmental destruction, modern slavery, etc.
As proof, note the difference between unenlightened economists:
progress has.. (questioned) whether it is.. impossible that all should start in the world with a fair chance.. The question cannot be fully answered by economic science. For the answer depends.. on the moral and political capabilities of human nature (which) the economist has no.. special.. information (Marshall)
John D. Rockefeller’s dog may receive the milk that a poor child needs to avoid rickets. Why? Because supply and demand are working badly? No. Because they are doing what they are designed to do, putting goods in the hands of those who can pay the most.(Samuelson)
versus an enlightened economist:
Political œconomy..proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign.” (Book 4, Adam Smith) In every civilized society..there were always two..systems of morality.. (Book 5) No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.(Book 1)
In future posts, I will define the personal and social economies in more detail. Generally, the ideas behind the personal economy are sourced from Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature which then lead to the micro economy via Books 1 and 2 of The Wealth of Nations, while the ideas for the social economy are sourced from Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments which lead to Books 3 to 5 of The Wealth of Nations. You could probably say that the personal economy is welfare economics with a new moral base, and that the social economy is behavioral economics with metaphysics as its foundation (or the dynamics of the metaphysical soul, as opposed to the dynamics of the physical brain). All four economies then work together to ensure wealth for everyone, leading to the happiness of all (even the plants and animals that exist with humans).
