Here is a table for the four classifications of Exchangeable value in Superphysics, using "price" as its snapshot:


Superphysics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable (Buyer's perspective) | Nominal Price (value in currency) | Market Price (value to the buyer)
Objective and Natural or Invariable (Seller's perspective) | Real Price (value in grain or labour) | Natural Price (value to the seller)


This is in contrast to Economics which has no concept of Real and Natural Price as it would prevent arbitrage, profit maximization, and consequently private sensory pleasures. It only has economic value (nominal price) and market value (market price):


Economics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable | Nominal Price (value in currency) | Market Price (value to the buyer)



We can now summarize our laws:

Law | Price | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Utilization - exposes the lack and the need
2 | Real | Specialization - increases quality and quantity to deal with the lack
3 | Market | Diffusion - addresses the lack
4 | Natural | Balance - prevents the crashes that leads to a recurrence of lack

  

In addition, we can see how the four laws of value are the reverse of the laws of thermodynamics. For example:
- the Zeroth law or the balancing of temperature is the first in Physics, but is the last in Superphysics as economic balance of the Fourth law
- the Third law, as absolute zero, is the last in Physics, but is the first in Supereconomics as its First law, as everything having a value.

This is because Physics believes that the universe began as an energetic Big Bang where energy began first, whereas humans start from birth or low-energy sleep where lack begins first

Superphysics law | Thermodynamics law counterpart
--- | ---
1st | 3rd 
2nd | 2nd
3rd | 1st
4th | 0th

<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our 'equation' for demand and supply as ps:pd{{< s v="D" >}}. This overturns the mercantilist 'Law' of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:

*Our eagle equation for all kinetic movementfits into both the Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Value. The image above is for potental movement (I noticed that some physicists tend to be very fussy about the difference between potential and kinetic energy)*

We find that these four laws match the four factors of our [DCIT model](/posts-pantrynomics/the-demand-capital-industry-trade-model/) which is made up of:

| **Factor** | **Law of Value** | **Value** | **Model** | **Physics equivalent** | **Pantrynomic system** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand | First | Natural Price | GPFY | Higgs Field | Basic Universal Revenue <br> as store of value <br> and the Grain Index | Basis of economic justice <br> which is lacking in both <br> Capitalism and Communism |
| Capital | Second | Real Price | GUE | Gravitation (we gravitate <br> towards certain interests <br> based on our dharma) | Effort Theory of Value <br> ISAIAH Match | Leads to economic democracy <br> and maximized non-commercial potential|
| Industry | Third | Nominal Price <br> (value in currency) | GGAMS | Strong Layer | Real Price via <br> the Economic Table | Economic balance or stasis <br> that is lacking in Capitalism |
| Trade | Fourth | Market Price <br> (value to the buyer) | GRID | Electroweak | Exchange systems with maintenance cost | Regulates merchants as <br> the opposite of Mercantilism |

4/2017: added Economics value matrix

8/2020: overhauled to match Superphysics

7/2021: overhauled to base everything on the four laws

2/2022: Added the four classes (Worker, Warrior, Philosopher, Merchant) onto the four laws
