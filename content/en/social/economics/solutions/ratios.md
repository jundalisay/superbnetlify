For the past few months, we have been testing the operations of our proposed points-based economic system. 

We have come up with the following ratios to determine the useful productivity of the users of our system just as capitalism has ratios such as Earning per Share, ROI, Return on Assets, etc. 

## Realization Ratio

This is the ratio of the actual realized points versus the total points. 

```elixir
Realized Points / Total Net Points 
```

## Average Time to Realize  

This is the average time that it takes to realize a point from the time when that point was created or given. 

```elixir
AVE(Time of Point Debit - Time of Point Credit) 
```

## Transaction Usefulness Ratio  

This is the number of transaction instances that were realized, relative to the total number of transactions done. 


```elixir
Realized Transaction Instances / Total Number of Transactions Done 
```
