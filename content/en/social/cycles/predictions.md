{{< q a="Confucius" >}}
Tsz-chang asked: Is it possible to forecast the state of the country 10 generations from now?<br><br>Confucius: The Yin dynasty adopted the rules and manners of the Hu line of kings. It is possible to tell whether it retrograded or advanced. The Chow line has followed the Yin and adopted its ways. Whether there has been deterioration or improvement may also be determined.  Some other line may take up in turn those of Chow. If this process goes on for 100 generations, then the result may be known.

Since the 2008 from the US Presidential elections and 2013 from the Greek Debt Crisis, we've been making predictions on society and economics as an implentation of Supersociology.

## Prediction List 

Here are the results so far:

Country | Year Prediction was Made: Prediction | Outcome

World | 2015: A global crisis will spark in 2019 marking the start of a long crisis which we call 'The Crisis Years' | {{< color val="Correct" >}}
World | 2019: A global financial crisis will emerge in a certain year between 2020-2030 as a result of that 2019 crisis | {{< c v="orange" >}}Pending{{< /c >}}

![Japan flag](/flags/jp.png) | 2021: Probing prediction--Kono will be Prime Minister. In reality, Kishida won. This proves that Japanese political system is [a society within a society](/social/cycles/how-to-fix-japan/) that represents itself and not the people, just like China's Communist party. To predict Japan's elections, the model has to be applied to the LDP | {{< color color="Navy" val="Null" >}}

As you can see, there were many mistakes in the beginning. But just like any learning system, it gets better in time as the patterns of social cycles and their interaction with each other become clearer.


## Based on Recurring Social Cycles

The core of the model is based on David Hume‘s maxim that mentality creates reality. The model proposes that human society is a metaphysical entity that is made up of individual metaphysical entities called human souls or abstract minds. 

This society has its own known dynamics which is explained by the ‘Social Cycle’ model of Socrates and the ‘Moral Sentiments’ model of Adam Smith, Hume's best friend.

![David Hume](/covers/hume.jpg)

Each society’s mentality has its own cycles which clash or concur with those of others, creating the events in the news. By knowing the flow of each mentality, then the outcome of regular events or long-running events can be predicted, such as elections, conflicts, or economic recessions. This is somewhat used nowadays in Game Theory. However, instead of creating selfish actors like in game theory, we use a specific range of actor ‘types’ with their own attributes and dynamics. 

<!-- (/fallacies/economics/nash-equilibrium-fallacy) -->

These ‘types’ are generally known as varnas in Hinduism and the social classes in ancient China.

Historical events are used as ‘markers’ for plotting the flow of this mentality, which can be used as training data for Artificial Intelligence to better crunch all events together to form more accurate mentalities and therefore predictions.


## Some Countries are Easy to Predict, Some are Difficult

It's easy to make accurate predictions for the USA because there is a lot of consistent, historical data from its inception in 1776 up to today. However, it's difficult to make predictions for:
- Middle Eastern countries like Syria and Iraq as they were bunched up together under the Ottoman Empire for many years
- countries whose histories are not in English, such as Vietnam and Thailand
- countries that have so much historical information such as China and India. This increases the noise which prevents accurate modelling. The Europeans fixed this problem when enlightened writers weeded out the noise or inferior historians
