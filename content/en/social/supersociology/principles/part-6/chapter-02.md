## Declaration of Perpetual Unity

### The Ego as the Source of Problemms

The ego is the feeling of the self. The self is the identity perceived from the separation of identities. 

I am a me-identity. You are you-identity. The serparation between you and me is caused by our egos. 

Egos are stifled or made less significant when identities are merged, such as when you and I form a partnership, a brotherhood, or a team. In society, this happens when two people marry, or when two or more people create associations, companies, and societies. 

Society is the  


## Feelings

**Article 1: The Feelings**

All actions come from feelings. 


**Article 2: Virtues** 

A virtue is a combination of specific feelings which aim at positive results, agreeable to humans in general. 


**Article 3: Detestable Vices**

Vices are the opposite of virtue. Detestable vices are those that are abhorrent to the general human feelings. Examples are:

- mass murder and genocide
- mutilation and violent rape

Humans who carry such feelings with the intention of realizing them are to be called "inhumane". 


**Article 4: Eradicating Detestable Vices**

We will aim to eradicate such feelings and detestable vices from having a chance of breeding in human minds and hearts through a comprehensive approach tapping into morals, traditions, religions, systems, laws, and policies. 




## Cardinal Human Rights

**Article 5: Condition**

These human rights are not available to the inhumane which will have the non-human rights instead.


**Article 6: Unity and Society** 

All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights within a society, predisposed to unity.

The existence of human society is a manifestation of this predisposition. These unified human rights, therefore, can only exist within a structure of a society. 


**Article 7: Ego and Human Limitation**

The ego, as the feeling of the self, causes disunity and all the problems in society. It hampers fellow-feeling and the development of virtue. 

Related to the ego are human sensory limitations. These lead to variations in culture, language, religion, ideologies, and mentalities. <!--  or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.  -->

<!-- No distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty. -->


**Article 8: No Slavery or Arbitrary Detention**

The ego leads to the slavery and arbitrary arrest, detention or exile of others. Thus, we guarantee that every human has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 

<!-- Slavery is prohibited, whether in physical or mental spheres.

No one shall be subjected to . -->


Article 7

All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. 

All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.


Article 8

Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.


Article 10

Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.


Article 11

Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.

No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the penal offence was committed.


Article 12

No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. 

Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
