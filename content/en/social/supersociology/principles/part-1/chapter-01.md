<!-- A society needs 3 entties. The third entity becomes the arbiter. Without the third entity, then the relationship is a partnership which is arbitrary.  -->

Modern Sociology defines a society as "a group of people who live in a defined geographic area, who interact with one another, and who
share a common culture."

Our definition looks at society from a metaphysics-first perspective. We define a society as a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society either implicitly or explicitly.

- Implicit agreement is by convenience. 
- Explicit agreement is by choice. 

Since science views minds as coming from the physical brain, we instead use the word 'soul' or 'aethereal mind' to refer to a society. In this way, a society can refer to:
- the soul of society, or
  - This the source of its culture in the abstract
- the physical society
  - This the source of its culture in the physical sense


English | Superphysics | Sanskrit
--- | --- | ---
Soul | Aethereal Mind | Jivatman
Mind | Physical Mind (Aethereal Mind connected to body) | Jivatman
Consciousness | Experiencer | Atman



By referring to a society as a soul, we:
- free it from physical limitations
- give it flexible qualities that are similar to sound and music
  - These flexible qualities resemble waves, which is the medium to transmit feeling-information. 

For example, a tune can change either gradually or immediately from melodic to rhythmic, just as a mind can choose to switch from eating American food to Chinese food gradually or immediately.

> *A society is three or more entities working towards a common goal or interest. A partnership is a bit different as it needs to two entities as a minimum. Thus, a childless husband and wife is a partnership. It becomes a society after having a child. A family is a common example of a society. A basketball team is a society, different from tennis-doubles players that form a partnership. Since a team is a society, it also is subject to social cycles which manifest as winning and losing streaks.



{{< quote ava="hume" >}}
The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations. No one can be actuated by any affection which others are not susceptible to. In wound-up strings, the motion of one string communicates itself to the rest. So all the affections readily pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in every human creature.
<cite>The Simple Treatise Of Human Nature Section 1, Part 3, Book 3</cite>

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
Few people ever reflect that from the evil of other men, something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others becomes more and more difficult to repress
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 10</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


This flexibility lets souls send and receive invisible information via intuition. In our music analogy, the orchestra can get visual hints from the conductor to speed up the tempo or make the strings louder. 

This flexible quality also lets souls merge and agree, as proven by the phrase "the meeting of minds" or "being on the same page". This would be like an orchestra adding more instruments that jive with its style. 

Matter and physical objects, on the contrary, cannot occupy the same physical 'page' nor meet at a 'place' without losing their individual identity.

We then call this merging of the minds or souls as a society. For example:
- A family begins when a man's soul agrees to unite with a woman's soul which then adds another soul as their child. A divorce is a dissociation of the soul the family back into its component souls
- A company begins when the souls of the incorporators agree to be bound into a business organization
- A sports team begins when the souls of playes agree to play together

Human society began as families agreeing to work together for mutual benefit, which we call [the common interest](/social/supersociology/principles/common-interest). We can say that the common interest is the conscience of the soul of society, just as a person's own conscience represents his soul's best interest for himself. We refrain from doing a bad thing because our conscience will implant the feeling of guilt in our minds, as a natural warning about the resulting consequence or karma. 

Societies then agree and merge with other societies to form nations, which can merge to form confederations, which can finally form a global human society. Social Superphysics aims to form such a unified society by explaining the properties of the soul, as explained by Socrates, David Hume, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. 


Lateral Type | Metaphysical Organism | Physical Example | Parts | Explanation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Personal | Mind or Soul (Jivatman) | You or Self (Jiva) | Perception  Your perceptions mold your mind | 
Group | Soul of society | A basketball team | Individual minds | Society is molded by the minds inside it (A weak basketbal team is one with weak members) 
Species | Soul of species | Human species | Individual societies | Species evolve as one in order to live better 
Planetary | Soul of planet | Earthlings | Each species (cats, dogs, humans, potatoes) | All species evolve according to their planet's conditions | 
Stellar | Soul of the star system | system | Individual planets | All planets affect each other 
Galactic | Soul of galaxy | Milky way | Individual stars | Life begins from supernova which spread throughout its galaxy 
Universal | Soul of universe |  Physical Universe | Individual galaxies | The galaxies form the mind of the universe as a portion of Existence
Multiversal | Soul of Existence (Paramatman) | Multiverse (Brahma) | Individual Universes and Realities |  The physical and metaphysical parts of the universe form Brahma 


The entire human species is therefore one big society made up of all human minds. David Hume and Socrates use the analogy of citizens being the individual souls with their government as the oversoul. Quesnay uses the analogy of cells in a body. In Hinduism, this is similar to the atman (consciousness) making up the paramatman (universal collective consciousness).

If common interest naturally makes humans unite into societies, why do we see so much inequality, hate, and conflict?


## The Ego Separates the Union of Souls

The flexibility of the soul (or malleability of the mind) is the main quality that allows it to connect and merge with other souls, whether it be of animals, plants, or humans. The loss of this flexibility (as the rigidity of the mind) disconnects the soul from others and confines it to itself. 

This confinement builds ego, which is the feeling for the self. When left unchecked, this ego leads to disagreements, disunity, and eventual conflict. The more democratic the society, the more difficult it is to maintain unity:

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
Rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small democracies. Those factions have so frequently divided their people and disturbed the peace of their democratic governments. 
<cite>The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 5, Chapter 3</cite>

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
Are you not aware that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable? ..But reason will not allow us to believe this. It will not let us believe that the soul, in its truest nature, is full of variety, difference, and dissimilarity. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 10</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
When the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division, the several parts are just. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 9</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself' because the master is also the servant and the servant is the master since the same person is denoted. It really means that in the human soul there is a better and a worse principle. When the better has the worse under control, then a man the master of himself. When due to evil education or association, the better principle is overwhelmed by the worse principle, then the man is blamed and is called "unprincipled" or the slave of the self. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 4</cite>

## The Solution: Harness the Common Interest via Social Networkism 

<!-- Dialectical Social Networkism -->

It would be easier to prevent the growth of ego by pointing out that no one is perfect:

- A beautiful woman will have most of her attention on her physical looks, making her deficient in intellect
- An intelligent man will have most of his attention on abstract ideas, making him deficient in bodily strength or looks

> Here, the common interest is overall personal well-being:

- A popular politician will spend most of his time interacting with the masses, instead of spending time for policy research
- A bright researcher will have many good policy-ideas, but will not have the popularity or connections to have them implemented

> Here, the common interest is implementing the right policies


- A skilled app developer can create a superior app, but might not have the skill to market it 
- An active marketer can make any app go viral, but might not know how to make an app in the first place

> Here, the common interest spreading useful apps 

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
Then in our city, the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other. <!-- When anyone is well or ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is ill.' --> They will have their pleasures and pains in common. They will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own'. Having this common interest, they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain. The is because the guardians will have a community of women and children. We called this unity of feeling as the greatest good.
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 5, Chapter 2</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

Thus, the key to common interest is to group everyone according to ideas that would interest them. This would let them gravitate to it and hopefully lower their egos in order to explore that idea further. 

For example, we sometimes go to Meetups about the food, technology, artists, and sports that we like. Nowadays, the internet, social networks, and messaging apps like Whatsapp, Zalo, and Viber help us to access such interests virtually. 


<!--  manage such variety and disparity of minds if they were grouped by their inherent qualities, manifesting as their personal interests. Adam likes to catch fish, Barbara likes to sing, Charlie likes to write software, Dan likes to play instruments. We can group Barbara and Dan together since their interests are similar. Barbara would probably be happier with Dan than with Charlie who likes quiet concentration. 

This personal interest then forms what Socrates calls the 'true nature' and what the Hindus call the 'svadharma'. But how would someone know his true personal interest? 

Socrates called this process of knowing as 'dialectics'.

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
The power of dialectic lets the reason attain that other sort of knowledge using the hypotheses as steps into a world which is above hypotheses, so that she may soar beyond them into the original principle. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 6</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

Unlike epistemology that is based on logic alone, dialects is based on feelings. Dialectics is a method that forces the individual to look beyond the self, into something higher, so that his mind will see any issue from a higher level. This is different from debate which preserves the ego and is competitive in nature. Dialectics goes beyond competition or argument in order to arrive at a solution instead of a victory, by probing the issue and doing trial and error. A regulator then implements this system to ensure that society stays as a cohesive unit.

## Facebook is a Personal Network, Not a Social Network

Unfortunately, some social apps group people not to build the common interest, but merely funnel advertisements more effectively. An example is Facebook which lets its users add other users that they like, creating a **personal network** instead of a proper social network.  

Those users can then post whatever is in their personal interest which then creates a personal bubble or echo chamber that might go against other bubbles. If left unchecked, it can lead to online conflict, followed by real physical conflict or harm.

<!-- traps its users in an echo chamber that can help it serve ads that strike our personal or group interest. 

In addition, Facebook has no active regulator to keep its users united or prevent conflict. This creates disharmony which increases into radicalism since the interactions are often left unchecked* in the name of freedom. -->

<!-- Because Facebook has no regulator, anyone can add users according to their whim. Therefore, it is really a personal network instead of a real social network since personal interest, and not common interest, dominates. This creates a  -->

> In order to earn more from ads, some social networks focus on user quantity instead of user quality. Our system is different because it earns primarily from a tax, as [Pointtax](https://pantrypoints.com/docs/pantrynomics/pointtax), and only secondarily from advertising.

A true social network therefore is one that encourages personal interest as long as it is within the common interest. This necessitates a regulator, just as an early society has a chieftain and a modern society has a President or Prime Minister. The key qualification of this regulator is his understanding of the common interest as to keep the society unified and whole. His whole moral authority depends on this. 

Socrates' version of the regulators are the guardians who are morally upright:

{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
The guardians will be delivered from all these evils. Their life will be more blessed than the life of Olympic victors. The Olympic victor is happy to receive a part only of the blessedness secured to our citizens. The citizens' victory is the salvation of the State at the public cost. The crown with which they and their children have is the fulness of all that life needs.
{{< /quote >}}


<!-- 
 therefore not based on arbitrary friend-additions, but on real social contracts or promises, as desribed by David Hume. This is why our proposed economic system is based on social contracts, as a tool to realize the common interest. Thus we define dialectical social networkism as a paradigm that uses Dialectics to implement a system of social contracts, under a moral authority, in order to generate sustainable happiness for the self through its society and beyond.

In future posts, we will explain how this moral authority can be implemented by machine learning in order to create what Socrates calls guardians.
 -->

 
We implement his guardians as [ISAIAH](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah) which is the machine learning that will regulate our proposed social pantrynomic network which implements our concept of social networkism desribed here. Thus, social networkism is made up of the following ideas:

- The soul of society being made up of individual souls that merge and dissociate flexibly
- A common interest that unifies such souls together into a society 
- A moral leader or regulator to protect and grow that common interest
