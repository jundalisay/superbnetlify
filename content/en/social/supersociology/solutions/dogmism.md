Islamic terrorism became known worldwide because of the 9/11 attacks, which overshadowed previous attacks from the 1970’s. Since then, terrorism has been unfortunately and unfairly connected to Islam.

This connection is easily brought back up to mind and conversation whenever a terrorist attack occurs, whether it was rooted in Islam or not. Whenever a terrorist attack occurs, the common expectation nowadays is for it to be caused by a disgruntled Muslim. Whenever it is proven to be caused by a Muslim, then anti-Islam sentiments rise and Muslims take a defensive stance. Proper Muslims expectedly denounce the attack and say that it was un-Islamic. But by then, the connection between Islam and terrorism would have really formed in the public’s mind. 

This in turn causes the public to be anti-Islamic which then creates more disgruntled Muslims who can get easily radicalized, creating more terrorists. The cycle is created and strengthened. We can call this 'the cycle of extremism'.



## The Cause: Connecting ideas to other ideas, which are just remotely connected

Since it is obvious that terrorist attacks are un-Islamic and anti-society, referring to such terrorists as ‘Islamic’ terrorists is a misnomer. It ultimately would be a fallacy since even terrorist groups are mini-societies themselves. It would be like calling a bacteria that killed other bacteria as an 'anti-bacteria bacteria'. Instead, we call it as an 'antibiotic'. 

Terrorist attacks are based on a blind belief propagated by the founders of those terrorist societies. For example, Osama Bin Laden propounded a wrong and blind belief that terrorist attacks would drive Americans out of the Middle East. But in reality, it caused the Americans to flock into Iraq and Afghanistan as soldiers from 2003. It even caused his own death in 2011 through a US Navy Seal attack. 

In the end, Bin Laden’s belief left everyone — himself, his friends and foes, Muslims and Americans alike — worse off.  Clearly, if Bin Laden knew his own interest and could either look deeply into the root causes of his anger or have foresight of its consequences, then his mind would’ve never created such a belief in the first place. If he could connect his idea of smashing airplanes onto tall buildings with the idea of US revenge that would hurt both himself and Islam, then he would not have done what he did. 

David Hume knew that most humans have a weak ability to connect effect with ultimate causes and causes with their long-term effects.

{{< q a="hume" >}}
Shallow thinkers tend to decry even those of solid understanding, abstruse thinkers, metaphysicians, and refiners. They call anything that is beyond their own weak conceptions as unjust.
<cite>Essay 2: Commerce, Simplified Essays by David Hume</cite>

**Thus, those who blame terrorism on Islam is suffering from the same weakness that caused the terrorist to do his attack in the first place.** They do not see that jihad was meant to keep Muslims within Islam and never to terrorize others:


{{< q >}}
Jihad is ordained for you though you dislike it. They will turn you back from [Islam]. Whoever turns back from [Islam] will [go to hell]
<cite>The Prophet Mohammad</cite>
{{< /q >}}


This is a self-defense measure to keep Islam intact amidst all the rival philosophies going around. The best solution is not to attack Islam and to let Muslims get the good and bad consequences of their beliefs.

## The Solution: A New Term Called ‘Dogmism’

The cycle of extermism can be broken by separating the idea of terrorism from the idea of Islam. The former arises from extreme shallow feelings caused by a heightened ego. The latter is its opposite, trying to make such strong egos submit to a unifying idea called Allah. 

We separate terrorism from Islam by using the term 'dogmism' as a container for shallow-minded extremist beliefs. For example, we can refer to Al-Qaeda attacks as part of **Bin Laden’s Dogmism**, which is similar to but different from that of ISIS which we can call **Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi’s Dogmism**. Notice that in both dogmisms, the word ‘Islam’ or ‘Muslim’ is never encountered. 

Another example is Hitler’s final solution of killing all Jews in Europe, which we can call **Hitler’s Dogmism**. This avoids reference to 'Socialism' which is part of the Nazi name. In this way, the root cause can be easily traced to the originators of the blind belief, such as Bin Laden, Baghdadi, and Hitler, isolating them from Muslims, Arabs, and Germans respectively.

<!-- Since human minds are commonly ‘vulgar’ or shallow and unphilosophical, then the best solution to terrorism is to isolate the conflict to the parties involved and leave everyone else out of it. Humans naturally get angry and some humans might lose control like animals if they do not have the proper moral, philosophical or social education or training. Rather than name such blind-belief-based-conflicts as ‘Islamic’ terrorism, it would be more proper to call it under the blanket term as ‘Dogmism’ which refers to conflicts or problems based on blind, irrational, or vulgar beliefs. Each family or genus of Dogmism will then have its own specific species. -->

The public will then connect the terrorist attacks to the person/s or originator/s himself/themselves instead of to a whole religion, race, country, etc., sparing that religion, race, or country. Once the whole world, and even the originator, knows about the specific flavor of that dogma and its originator-person, then the world can simply find solutions against that person and the causes behind such flavor of dogmism.

For example, Trump's policy, of blaming election loss as cheating by the opposition, as **Trump's Dogmism**. This separates it from the Republican party. The word 'dogmism' adds a negative connotation so that 'Trump's Dogmism' is negative, but 'Trumpism' might be neutral of positive. 

<!-- The science behind this solution is in metaphysics, specifically in the theory that ideas have the same dynamics as viruses. Viruses are everywhere, but they only infect those with frail bodies and weak natural immune systems. Likewise, bad ideas are everywhere, but normally, people have strong or rational minds and have good educational systems to make them immune. However, in some cases minds become weakened or damaged and education becomes perverted, making it easy for bad ideas to take root in the mind, such as during the spread of Communist ideas in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia 50 years ago when those areas were battered by World War II and the Cold War. -->
