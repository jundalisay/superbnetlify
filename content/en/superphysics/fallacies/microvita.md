In the paper "Space, Time, and Contigency", Dr. Rudolph quotes Indian philosopher PR Sarkar:

{{< q >}}
there cannot be steady movement. There must be acceleration – either constant acceleration or accelerated acceleration, or retardation – either constant retardation or retarding retardation. Along with these are galloping jumps. And before and after these jumps, there are biological changes, historical changes, agricultural changes and human psychic changes.”
{{< /q >}}


The authors ask: what causes those jumps?

Through self-delusion, they answer themselves:  These jumps are brought about by <!-- positive and negative --> Microvita going back in time through "transformations from one space-time into another, i.e. from an imaginary future to the real present."

They base their reasoning in the ability of enyzmes to make biochemical reactions in living organisms (past to present). They then extend this to Microvita which can affect changes from the future onto the present:   

{{< q >}}
enzymes are able to control biochemical reactions forwards-in-time (from real past to present), Microvita are able to do so backwards-in-time, i.e. <i>from an imaginary future to our present conditions of life</i>
{{< /q >}}

To which we say:

### WHAT THE FLYING F...?!?!

![WTF!](/graphics/wtf.png)



For some reason, the authors adopt the Aristotlean and Einsteinian way of thinking to allow time to go backwards. They then impose it on PR Sarkar's Microvita theory. To them, this then answers the question by saying that Microvita from the future causes the predictable changes in the present by going back in time to impose those changes. 

This can be logically refuted by saying that Microvita from the past could also gallop forward to cancel those future changes. This then would cause no galloping changes or even accelerated changes. 

Their main flaw is to blindly accept Aristotlean and Eisteinian limited-thinking and impose them onto PR Sarkar's universal-thinking. 


### The Correct Solution

We answer that galloping changes are caused by Microvita from the same space and timeline (not from the past or the future). 

These Microvita travel the universe in waves, just like the ocean waves hit a rock in a predictable manner. We never say that those waves came from a future-ocean that came to hit the present-rocks.

PR Sarkar likely foresaw in March 1990 that a Negative Microvita wave, as Covid-19, would arrive soon. It did arrive in December 2019 and it *IS* causing a galloping change to the whole history of the human species.

With this reasoning, there is no need to create complex 4x4 spacetime matrices to explain the current galloping change. Instead, the change is caused by regular waves of Positive and Negative Microvita hitting the Earth regularly in the normal Galilean spacetime. 

The origin of Covid or Negative Microvita is then the star (which we call [the Covid star](/medical/physical/solutions/covid-flu-star)) which emits the energy to support its wave. This is similar to the sun emitting energies to support us here on earth.

Ideally, the forces of Positive Microvita should have been building up from March 1990 to counteract the current wave of Negative Covid Microvita. Unforunately, the positive force got dogmatized and static. And so there is nothing to stop the Negative force from ravaging the planet. Rudolph and Vimalananda got seduced by the false intellect of Aristotle and Einstein and so were rendered useless by the same Negative force that powers Covid. 

<!-- Microvita is supposed to solve Covid. 

It is unable to do so, simply because the people who were supposed to do it () reverted to materialist Aristotlean limitation. 

Enzymes as microvita control the present in order to convert an organism into a different future-organism (impose a change). They then connect that idea of change into the galloping changes in society, mentioned in the quote of PR Sarkar. Thus, their logic goes:

1. Enzymes cause changes
Microvita are enzymes
Changes can gallop
Microvita causes the galloping
