In the previous chapter, we divided Existence into 2 domains:

1. Metaphysical: This creates metaphysical reality
2. Physical: This creates physical reality

This has practical uses. 

For instance, we sometimes perceive something totally new. When Covid first struck in December 2019 in Wuhan, doctors had **no metaphysical idea of it**, even if they could see the physical disease. 

In this case: 
- the physical disease started to exist through the senses of the Wuhan doctors
- the metaphysical idea existed in Nature, but not in human minds. It only existed in minds after the scientists established it as a new idea called Novel Coronavirus Disease, later renamed as **Covid-19**


{{< img src="/photos/med/covid.jpg" alt="Covid in water" cap="The idea of Covid is started to exist in the physical domain when the physical perception of the new virus began. Its evolution from 'Novel Coronavirus Disease' to 'Covid-19' is an example the 'aether drag'" >}}



## The Superiority of the Metaphysical Over the Physical

This strengthens the fact that:
- physical things are tangible and perceivable through our five senses
- metaphysical things are perceivable through our intellect and feelings (the 6th sense).

{{< img src="/photos/objects/mugecon.jpg" alt="Mug Economics">}}

The mug only existed after the maker of mugs had the idea of a mug, as to be able to create a physical mug. It follows that Covid-19 existed after Nature had the idea for it, and that its solution already exists in Nature*.

*This is why our proposed solution to end Covid is to end the war against the Amazon rainforest, just as the Spanish flu ended after the peace of World War I. Vaccines are just a workaround that is supposed to buy time to implement that real solution. Unfortunately, science thinks that vaccines are the solution. The error in this is proven by the rise in the recent Covid hospitalizations in Europe despite their high vaccination rates.

Thus:
- every physical thing or perception has a corresponding metaphysical idea or feeling
- every idea or feeling exists before its physical version does.

For example, before a novel about a cat is written in a physical form, the idea for the novel must exist first. 

All philosophical debates on ultimate causes can thus be categorized as 'chicken-versus-egg' as:
- pro-metaphysicality as ideas, spirit, and Plato's forms (this is the chicken)
  - In Hindu philosophy this manifests as Vedanta and Buddhism
  - In Chinese philosophy, this manifests as Taoism 
  - In Islamic philosophy, this manifests as Sufism
- pro-physicality as matter, evidence, and Aristotle's material substance (this is the egg)
  - In Hindu philosophy, this manifests as sects of Shaivism and Kali (idol-worship)
  - In Chinese philosophy, this manifests as Confucianism, saving face, and showing how prosperous you are as a physical proof of your happiness
  - In Islamic philosophy, this manifests as the Sunni policies such as Sharia (e.g. the Quran has geocentric physics inherited from Aristotle)  


_ | Philosophy | Science
--- | --- | --- 
Emphasis | Spirit and ideas | Sensory proofs and material evidence
Consciousness is.. | ..the metaphysical soul | ..the physical brain 

Superphysics is in between both abstract philosophy and material science.
- It is grounded on the metaphysical, but can quickly extend down to sensory evidence and practicality. 
- It sees the physical brain and its hormones as the effect of the metaphysical soul and its feelings. 
- It does not go into final causes, since the final cause is always the Supreme Entity which is the scope of Metaphysics, not Superphysics


{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics" >}}
People do all things for the useful end that they want. This is why people look for the final causes of phenomena.

Unlike science which manipulates the brain and hopes that it changes the soul or mind, Superphysics works directly on the soul in order to resolve its physical issues with the brain.


<!-- ## Tap into your feelings, the deeper the better -->

## Ideas are Static, Feelings are Dynamic

The author of the novel about a cat starts to write it down by tapping into his feelings and ideas. These keep on changing dynamically as a flow which allow the cat's story to take a metaphysical shape. 

Will it flow to a happy ending? 

Will it be cute and funny? 

Or will it be sad and lonely?    

<!-- The changing flow of ideas and feelings of the author about the cat then lead to actual changes to the physical written novel.  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/flipbook.gif" alt="Flipbook about a cat" >}}


The reader of that novel will then experience **the wave of the author's feelings** about the cat through the movement of the characters and events in the novel. The reader will think that those events are single events, and that each character is a single character. 

In reality, each of those events and characters are made up of many slices of quantized-events and quantized-characters*.

> *Here we use the word 'quantize' instead of 'quantum' to emphasize the action of the mind that isolates the smallest perception that it can make.


For example, a cat character in a novel 100 pages is actually made up of 100-cat entities which are stitched together artificially by the mind into one consistent cat-entity.

Likewise, our reality is made up of independent "pages" or planes of reality that flow, or are connected by our minds with other contiguous planes, to create one consistent reality. This is the same mechanism that our minds use to connect the metaphysical domain with physical domain in order to create the current reality*.


> *Science and quantum mechanics can never reach into this because they do not allow a metaphysical domain.

<!-- a website must be coded first before it actually exists as a physical website, deployed by its developer. But before the web developer codes the website, he must first have the idea for it. The flow of his changing ideas and feelings about the website then influence the changes to the code which then changes the actual website.  -->


### We are Inside the Mind of the Creator, Everything is Its Idea

We can then make an analogy that the Creator of the universe began writing Its ideas onto the physical domain as the 'Big Bang'* as the first page of the novel of reality. The changes in the universe then arose from the Creator's changing ideas and feelings, just as the novel changes through time.

> *Our version is a metaphysical Big Bootup. Going to the beginning of space and time will merely extend or push the beginning of space and time. This is like chasing the wind or running in circles. 


Unlike Physics that only has physical time, Superphysics has both physical and metaphysical time:

{{< q >}}
The Creator rejoiced when He saw his creation moving and living..The nature of the creation's Idea-being was everlasting. But it is impossible to make creation everlasting. So He resolved to have a moving image of eternity. When He set the order of the heaven, He made this image eternal but moving according to number, while eternity itself rests in unity. 
<br><br>
This image is what we call time.

### Ideas are Particles, Feelings are Waves

These ideas and feelings from the Creator, thus, flow onto the physical domain in order to create reality in real-time:

- We define ideas as metaphysical particles
- We define feelings as metaphysical waves

This is similar to:

- how waves of electricity flow to our TVs to give us particles of pixels on the screen
- how radiowaves flow to our phones to give us particles of data that we see as websites and web pages 

These ideas and feelings are all made up of the positive and negative aspects. This is similar to:

- data being made up of 1's and 0's
- electricity arising from positive and negative charges

<!-- -  and all novels have text and blank spaces.  -->

<!-- The Big Bang is therefore the universe booting up to create real things that are ultimately based on metaphysical ideas.  -->

The Hindus call this Virtual Reality or Existence as **Brahma** and the Taoists call Its flow as the **Tao**. The ‘on’ or 'published' state is called **Saguna Brahma** and the ‘off’ or 'draft' state is called **Nirguna Brahma**. 


## Do You Have a Problem? The Solution Already Exists!

All the data served by the internet pre-exists, so it means that all possibilities already pre-exist. If you have a problem, then it means its solution pre-exists and you just have to find it. If the solution does not pre-exist, then it means your problem is not really a problem.

<!-- > *The evolution from problem to solution as still part of the aether drag. Without this drag, all problems would be solved instantly. Cavemen take a longer time to solve problems than modern humans and so we say they have more drag.  -->


For example, no one has ever imagined that humans should have three or four legs, and that having only two legs was a problem. Thus, there has never been a search for its solution. 

On the contrary, people have imagined that our inability to fly was a problem and so the solution manifested itself as powered flight. The metaphysical solution often arrives much faster than the actual physical solution, though in rare cases they can come together by coincidence.
