Adam Smith and David Hume are considered as 'enlightened' writers from a period called the Scottish Enlightenment. Latter writers are not enlightened Samuelson

Hume countered Locke and Spinoza, while Smith countered Mun and Mandeville. However, it seemed no one was able to carry on the Enlightenment to counter the erroneous beliefs popping up during the 19th century, such as

For example, instead of countering Say's utility, Mill supports it and uses it as a basis for his utilitarianism philosophy which then becomes a fundamental idea in modern economics.


<!-- The word 'science' replaced natural philosophy in the mid 19th century with . Smith has already asserted, after studying the history of the systems of learning, that all learning can be grouped into three, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, and Logic.

The ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches:

Physics or natural philosophy
Ethics or moral philosophy
Logic

“This general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.”

Is this still correct today? Can we reign in and simplify today's complicated and ultra-specialized systems of learning to match Smith's organization? Firstly, we answer this by using Hume's method of breaking compound ideas down to basic ones, we get the basic ideas from each branch:

Physics or natural philosophy (The external objective world)
Ethics or moral philosophy (The internal subjective world)
Logic (The tools connecting and making sense of the internal and external world)



The limitations of modern physics and the unsustainability of economics can be attributed to the fact both are unenlightened sciences, or that they focus on the effect instead of the cause.




In fact, the endeavor to create a new economic system necessarily creates two enlightenment-level sciences to serve as its ideological or philosophical foundation: Socioeconomics and Metaphysics.




We define enlightenment as the state of having:

penetrated the deception inherent in existence (according to Western Philosophy)
included in this is the realization of the nature of existence (effect) and the mind that perceives it (cause)
overcome Maya or the illusion of duality (according to Eastern Philosophy)
included in this is the realization of the cause of Maya, which is the non-dualistic, unqualified (nirguna) Absolute or Supreme Being

Both definitions ultimately end up with a Supreme Being as the cause and the universe, anything in it,  as the effect. -->



In Treatise, Hume explained that government and justice are artificial inventions to create peace and security. However, government and justice system nowadays are used not for peace and security, but for pleasure.


Darkness:
Say removed morality

Mill advocated utility

Marginalists based economics on Math and Profit Maximization

Fischer Further Developed Monetary and Finance

Crash and World War 2

Keynes Put Government Spending Overturning Smith Leading to Budget Deficits

Samuelson Set All These In Stone

Sustainability = Morality
