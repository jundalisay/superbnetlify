The interaction between ideas and the dharma of those ideas create a reaction which arises when ideas are brought near, made to interact, or are added or introduced to each other. 

This reaction manifests as:
- 'movement' from the perspective of space
- 'change' or 'evolution' from the perspective of time

The dynamics of this movement or change is explained by our **Elastic Theory** in Chapter 5. 
- In Material Superphysics, this is applied on physical movement
- In Medical and Social Superphysics, this is applied to:
  - The evolution of a person from health to disease, happiness to sadness
  - The metaphysical movement of a society from peace to war, or from prosperity to poverty  

This evolution is divided into the perceptions of cause and effect, just as movement is divided into starting location and ending location. 


## Cause and Effect

Chapter 3 explained how the action of bringing ideas near, introducing, or adding to others leads to reaction.
- The former is called "cause".
- The latter is called "effect".


The Sanskrit word *karma* implies a complete loop from cause and effect. 

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/karma.png" alt="Karma" cap="Science only has action and reaction. Superphysics has action, reaction, and samskara or the pending reaction which is withheld by the time factor" >}}
<!-- ![Karma]() -->

Existence is thus made up of unending loops of cause and effect, as idea and experience:
- An idea leads to action
- An action leads to an experience
- An experience leads to an idea 


The difference between Physics and Superphysics is that the latter has the Sanskrit concept of *samskara* which has has its own properties and dynamics. 

Science is aware of physical action and physical reaction. However, there are often many cases wherein such action and reaction are made up of a long chain of intervening-actions and intervening-reactions that might escape the immediate observation of the mind.

For example, the floodings from global warming is made up of a long chain of cause and effect*:
1. The burning of fossil fuels adds carbon dioxide in the air -- This is the action
2. The carbon dioxide traps the heat from the sun - This is an intermediate reaction which also becomes an action
3. The trapped heat causes warmer temperatures 
4. The warmer temperatures cause more evaporation of ocean water
5. The increased evaporation causes more water in the air
6. The increased water in the air falls down as severe floods -- This is the final reaction

> *This is an example of a Table by Francis Bacon

This chain has 6 points, connected by 5 'jumps' or chain-links of logic.
- We call the burning of fossil fuels as karma or action, that leads to severe floods, as *karma* or reaction.
- We call the formation of carbon dioxide and water in the air as *samskara* or pending reaction to the final effect of flooding. 

Treating humans as individuals, we can say that:
- samskara exists in the metaphysical domain since the intervening actions-reactions are outside of the scope of our perception
- karma exists in the physical domain since our actions and resulting experiences are physical 


<!-- This is similar to 'force' being a physical action that leads to a known reaction as movement. 

In the case of karma, an action, such as a policy to allow gun ownership, creates a known reaction such as a mass shooting.  -->

The knowledge of the principles of samskara will allow people to:
- lessen the coming 'bad' karma, usually manifesting as 'bad luck', by reducing or 'burning' the bad samskara 
- increase the coming 'good' karma ('good luck'), by accumulating the good samskara 

It can also allow a prediction of when such reactions are likely to occur so that they can be avoided or prevented.
- This is how scientists predict sea-level rise and the increase of natural disasters from the increase use of fossil fuels
- This is how we were able to [predict the global stagflation of 2022](/social/supersociology/precrisis-years) from the quantitative easing done from 2009.

This is also why Superphysics is against liberalism, libertarianism, or any belief that advocates the freedom to do anything or say anything that you want, even if it is within the law. This is because:
- humans have a natural limited cognition of samskara
- the law itself is made by humans who have limited cognition of samskara

These limitations prevent the 'actioner' from knowing the results of his action. 

For example, the United States allows people to say whatever they want even if it is hurtful to others. 
- This leads to a samskara of negative feelings within the population
- The negative feelings accumulate in the hearts and minds of the people  
- This explodes into the karma of hate and violence that manifests as mass shootings, race riots, local terrorism, etc. 

And so the best policy to end mass shootings is to restrain people from saying whatever they want. East Asians have such control and so mass shootings are rare in Japan, Korea, and China.

The next post will explain how we notate the chain of cause and effect, as Qualimath. 


<!-- ## Moral Consequentialism

Our proposed moral system, derived from Adam Smith, David Hume, and Socrates, is based on a clear definition of morality as happiness for the most entities possible for the longest time possible.

The "most entities possible" encompasses moral space, while "for the longest time possible" encompasses moral time. The end goal of maximizing moral space and time, by specifying "most" and "longest", is the attainment of the state of peace. This ultimate state then answers the purpose of creation and closes the loop of existence. In eastern philosophy, this state is attained in an experience called samadhi, which cancels out both the ego and mind in order to remove the illusion imposed by Nature.

With the goal defined, the next step is to explain the mechanism that our moral system uses to attain that goal. Since we want an effect of maximum long term happiness for all, then we can apply dialectics to trace the different root causes of such happiness, and even the causes of unhappiness in order to avoid them. We follow the advice of Socrates to start with the big picture, then drill down to the individual implementations or cases. We will logically find that all suffering and unhappiness is caused by excessive ego or the feeling of the self:

The holocaust was caused by Nazi ego, not feeling for the Jews
The Mongol conquest and the resulting Black Death was caused by the ego of the Mongols
World War I was caused by German ego
The conquest by Japan in World War II was caused by the ego of the Japanese imperial government -->
