Chapter 2 explained that we are inside the Mind of the Supreme Entity, as Its thoughts in Existence. 

We call a mind that is taken out of physicality as a 'Soul'. 

Therefore, our Universe which is a part of this Existence, is a thought-projection of the Universal Mind or Soul.

The ancients classified the universe into five elements which we match to the four fundamental forces of Physics. 


Rank | Name | Greek-Hindu | Chinese | Physics Force 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | Metaphysical | Metaphysics | ? | Pseudo-science  
1 | Aethereal | Aether, Akasha | 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science (as of the 20th century) 
2 | Spatial | Air, Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Gravity  
3 | Radiant | Fire, Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism  
4 | Transformative | Water, Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Weak  
5 | Material | Earth, Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Strong 


The nature of this Mind then forms the subdivisions of Superphysics:

Science | Purpose
--- | ---
Material Superphysics | Studies the nature of the Mind of the physical universe
Bio Superphysics | Studies the nature of the Mind of a living being
Social Superphysics | Studies the nature of the Mind of society as a collection of living beings
