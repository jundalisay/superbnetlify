Chapter 2 explained that we are inside the Mind of the Supreme Entity, as its thoughts in Existence. 

Therefore, our Universe which is a part of this Existence, is part of Its Mind.

The ancients classified the universe into five elements which we match to the four fundamental forces of Physics. 


Rank | Name | Greek-Hindu | Chinese | Physics Force 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | Metaphysical | Metaphysics | ? | Pseudo-science  
1 | Aethereal | Aether, Akasha | 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science  
2 | Spatial | Air, Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Gravity  
3 | Radiant | Fire, Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism  
4 | Transformative | Water, Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Weak  
5 | Material | Earth, Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Strong 


The nature of this Mind then forms the subdivisions of Superphysics:

1. Material Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of the physical universe
2. Bio Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of a living being
3. Social Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of society
