The previous chapter explained that The Experiencer has 2 parts:

1. Mind
2. Consciousness 

The Mind is the matrix or arena where Existence happens. This is similar to a virtual reality that runs inside a computer. The difference is that the Mind is metaphysical.   

<!-- ](/superphysics/principles/god), we explained that there are only 2 things in Existence:

1. Experience
2. Experiencer

Experience is Latin for `ex` (outwards) `+ periri` (try or undergo). We split it up into:

1. Ideas
2. Feelings

Feelings are powered by 2 Forces:

1. The Positive Force which focuses on unity, peace, precision, subtleness, and knowledge
2. The Negative Force which focuses on separation, activity, raw power, crudity, and creation -->

<!-- 1. The impersonal part of Existence as the Matrix (or Brahma, Tao, Sunya, the Whole)
2. The personal part of Existence as the Supreme Entity (or God, Allah, Yahweh, Kali, Ganesh, etc. which are really created by the positive feelings of the experiencer)  -->


But what is consciousness?

"Conscious" is Latin for 'with knowing' from `con + scire`. The problem is that knowing is the last phase of the process of experience, as the closed loop menionted in Chapter 4.


## The Perceiver

Knowledge is experience in its final form. To denote experience in its basic or non-final form, we use the word **'perceiver'** instead of consciousness.
- Perceive is Latin for 'by the taking' which is similar to 'receive' and 'conceive' (i.e. we receive and conceive of experiences)   

The journey from the conceptualization of an idea to its actual experience is powered by feelings which itself is powered by 2 forces*:
1. The Positive Force (Yang or Shiva)
2. The Negative Force (Yin or Shakti) 

<!-- These 2 forces cause anything and everythig to have 3 states:
1. 
2. 
3.  -->

The mind is an arena or container for experiences for the perceiver or consciousness. 

- A perceiver with an active mind is a living thing, due to the energy from the Positive Force
- A perceiver with an inactive mind is a non-living thing, due to the confinement of the Negative Force

![Audience](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/audience.jpg)

A living mind is like a theater that has activity, allowing actors and props to enter, perform, and exit. A non-living mind is a theater that is locked or closed.   

<!-- Here we add that the Experiencer itself is called Consciousness which resides in the arena of the mind. Thus, consciousness and mind go together. An active mind always has consciousness, but a consciousness does not always have an active mind. Similarly, a live theater always has an audience (even as empty seats), but an audience does not always have a theater. -->

<!-- David Hume defined mind as an arena or theater where perceptions play out. Consciousness therefore is the perceiver of those perceptions.  -->

The performance of the actors with the props and sounds are like the mind's thinking action. The backstage is like the memories waiting to go back onto the stage when called on. 

This processing turns ideas into thoughts and makes the difference* between 'ideation' and 'thinking'.  

<!-- The combination of the consciousness and its mind then leads to the thinking or ideating action, just as a live theater creates a spectating action in the audience as whispers, cheers, boos, laughter, etc. This turns the mind from an arena into a processing unit of existence. 
- The thinking is done by the mind, leading to thought*
- The experiencer (consciousness) then experiences the thought -->

> *We can say that 'idea' is the cause, while 'thought' is the effect



## The Perceiver is the State of Perception 
<!-- of Existence -->

While mind can be either active or inactive, the perceiver can only be 'on' or 'off' just as something can exist or not exist. 

This means that consciousness is not a thing or substance, but is merely **a state of an identity that determines whether it perceives or not.**

This state has two kinds:
1. On or Perceiving
2. Off or Not Perceiving


### All Things Can Perceive

The dynamics of the 2 forces implies that **everything is conscious, having the ability to perceive**. 

It is the **inability** of some identities to express those perceptions, due to the influence of the Negative Force, that makes things not seem to have any perception-ability (not be aware). But the fact that they can **react to actions** done onto them is proof that they are aware or can perceive.

For example, ice thaws when heated. This reaction is proof that the ice atoms were able to perceive the heat and reacted accordingly. 

**There is nothing that does not react to actions done on it.**  This is proof that the universe is aware and conscious even if their reactive potential is very limited. 

The perception-ability or consciousness in a piece of paper is proven when it:
- falls to the ground (reacts to gravity)
- is lifted by the air (reacts to aerodynamics)
- burns from a flame (reacts to thermodynamics)
- is cut by scissors (reacts to contact forces)
- and so on

A piece of paper that does not react to gravity, air, scissors, fire, etc has no perception-ability. But such a paper has never been observed and therefore does not exist.

This removes any mystical connotation on what consciousness or the perceiver is. Instead, the mystery is with:
- the nature of the mind that houses it, and
- what its perceptions are (i.e. how does a piece of paper feel about being cut, burned, or written on?)


<!-- This means that consciousness is the effect of existence and cannot possibly exist without the idea of existence. -->


## Desire Causes Existence

Since consciousness, perception, and existence go hand in hand, does this mean that the pereception-ability or consciousness is the cause of existence?

We experience the existence of a new day after we wake up and regain our ability to perceive. Therefore, consciousness causes existence, right?

This is not entirely correct because behind the waking up is the *desire* to wake up. Thus, **desire is the real cause of existence.** 

For example, if my entity (as my ego*) wants to experience the existence of a pink elephant, then:
- my desire will direct my mind to create a pink elephant, from my memories of an elephant and the color pink,
- that pink elephant will then be experienced by my perceiver (my consciousness), fulfilling my ego's requirement.


> *Ego is the feeling of the self. 'Feeling' itself is a wave and the base material of 'desire'.


In this case, the existence of the pink elephant in my mind needed 4 ingredients*:

1. A desire to experience a pink elephant 
2. A memory of the color pink and an elephant
3. A mind where those are combined to create the metaphysical pink elephant
4. A consciousness or perceiver to perceive it

> *Most of our volunteers are software developers so it's normal for us to painstakingly catch and list all the steps in any process


Thus:
- existence is the effect
- desire is the cause

In Hinduism, the Original Desire that created Existence, as Brahma, is called *Parashakti, Mahashakti,* or *Cittishakti*.

Technically, the idea-particle that took the form of a pink elephant was caused by the desire-wave for it.

A lot of metaphysical doctrines and moral philosophies emphasize consciousness and mind, **but do not look into the nature of desire and feelings of the mind**. In fact, we found only 3 authors so far who have explained feelings:

1. Spinoza
2. David Hume, as moral feelings
3. Ibn Khaldun, as group feelings



## Mentality Creates Reality

<!-- As you can see, desire is so powerful and essential to existence that it even leads to the existence of different ideas of Supreme Entities such as God, Yahweh, Allah, etc.  -->

The pattern of desires then form the mentality of a person, technically as the 'shape' of a person's mind. 

- The mentality of a Christian is formed by Christian desires
- The mentality of a Muslim is formed by Islamic desires
- The mentality of a scientist is formed by the desires for science
- The mentality of a KPOP fan is formed by the desires for KPOP

A person's mentality then leads to his actions in the physical dimension. Thus, by having desire as the root, it is easier to understand why and how 'mentality creates reality':

{{< quote ava="hume" >}}
It is an established maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence, or in other words, nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible.
<cite>A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 2, Section 2</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

A variation of this is 'If you want to experience a certain reality, then you first have to want it.'

- some people go through life without knowing what they want
- other people claim that they know exactly what they want 

Both of these are extremes which will reduce the probability of them experiencing their desired reality.

- the people who don't know what they want will have too little desire-power to particalize their waves*. This will cause them to fail in achieving any reality that they might desire. An analogy is the undercooking of a dish, which makes it not edible or far from ideal.
- the people who specify exactly what they want will have too much desire leading to a premature and rigid particalization. This explains why sheer grit and determination do not always lead to success. An analogy is the overcooking of a dish, which makes it useless

<!-- You want to have it just right. This precision is called being within the Dharma or the Tao or the flow of the universe, since the universe itself is a dynamic, moving, wave.  -->

<!-- > *Having too little desire makes the waves very weak. Having too much desire  -->

<!-- This however, would be purely philosophical and impractical  have nothing to do with our social cycles  because . It would also be impractical because we cannot create things instantaneously by merely thinking of them (rather, it could take a lot of time before they physically exist). -->

<!-- But wait! Wouldn’t having two opposing definitions for the same thing be absurd (i.e. paradoxical) since one definition would instantly destroy the other? Yes. To remove the paradox, we take our 'existence-creates-consciousness' idea first and then flip that into 'consciousness-creates-existence' idea afterwards. 

This flip is the same as a rescuer securing himself before securing others. The first step is very small and insignificant relative to the second step. 

![](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/childmask.jpg) -->


<!-- We have so far dissected the Experiencer into three:

1. Desire
2. Consciousness
3. Mind -->

Desire activates or 'turns on' consciousness or the perceiver which then activates or creates mind. 

<!-- Nirguna Brahma --> 

The Absolute Entity (as Pre-existence) wanted to exist and so It became <!-- Saguna Brahma --> the Supreme Entity (Existence). Why It wanted to exist is outside the scope of Superphysics and falls within metaphysics or religion (dogmatic metaphysics). 

The perceiver or consciousness thus has only one task: to experience existence.  

In addition, the perceiver is only binary, as either on or off:
- A perceiver that is off is unconscious and not perceiving. This implies that desire has left it just as electricity has left a light bulb as to turn it off
- A perceiver that is on is conscious and perceiving. This implies that it has desire in it just as a glowing light bulb means it has electricity in it

![Automated Intelligence](/photos/physics/ai.jpg)


**This means that everything that exists exists because the Supreme Entity wanted it to exist, as its idea.** The real question is why did the Supreme Entity desire that thing? 

<!-- any entity that is naturally alive has some desire in it to experience something.** The real metaphysical question is: What does that entity want to experience or is supposed to experience? -->

From the human perspective, this is embodied in the question: What do you want to do with your life? Or why do you exist? 


<!-- Either consciousness experiences or does not and is unconscious. When a person says that society's consciousness isn't evolved yet, it really means that society's mind* is not evolved yet, or has not enlarged. 

> *Remember that a mind is like a theater which has a size and many other features, whereas consciousness has only one feature which is to be either on or off, experiencing or not-experiencing. 

Its additional tasks of logic and thinking arises when **desire** is added onto it. This desire brings consciousness onto different physical or metaphysical experiences in a sequential manner, all of which are stored in its mind. This sequence leads to the concept of logic, while the storage leads to memory.

Thus, **desire is the ultimate cause and is the source of all mystery**. Why do you desire what you desire? What desire led to the criminal to do the crime? Why did the dinosaurs desire to fly and evolve into birds? Why did the universe desire to have four (or five) fundamental forces instead of three? What desire led the British to drive on the left and not on the right side of the road?

It is this solving of desire that solves mysteries by revealing the true nature, tao, or dharma of the desiring entity.

This simplification of what the human mind is trying to do in various cycles helps us get a clearer idea of what consciousness is, which we can now define as a processing unit of existence.
Consciousness = processing unit of existence
This means that consciousness is the effect of existence and cannot possibly exist without the idea of existence.
But wait! Won’t that definition make us materialistic because it makes consciousness subordinate to existence? Yes, because as physical beings, we open our eyes to see existence that is beyond our control. However, we can negate this definition if we could use our consciousness to create existence — I am conscious of a pink elephant and so a pink elephant exists in my mind. This would be a God point of view, and not a human point of view.
So from a God point of view we can say that consciousness is the cause of existence. This however, would be purely philosophical and have nothing to do with our social cycles. It would also be impractical because we cannot create things instantaneously by merely thinking of them (rather, it could take a lot of time before they physically exist).
But wait! Wouldn’t having two opposing definitions for the same thing be absurd (i.e. paradoxical) since one definition would instantly destroy the other? Yes. To remove the paradox, we assign a new word ‘mind’ for active consciousness or when it is used as the cause of existence, so that we have a draft definition:
Mind = processing unit of existence that also acts on existence
This would then make our earlier sentence more accurate and remove the paradox:
“My mind conceived an idea of a pink elephant and so a pink elephant existed in my mind.”
Mind would be a lot more difficult to define because it also requires a deep knowledge of existence. So we shall leave that for another post.
 -->


Superphysics is a bit different in that it views everything as an idea of the Supreme Entity and our existence being inside Its mind. Thus, the proper question is:


### Why is the Supreme Entity thinking of me?

Unlike the question "Why do I exist?" which enshrines the ego, this question puts the ego secondary or below that of the Supreme Entity. This will put the ego's desire in line with desire the Creator of Existence. This, in turn, will increase the chances of achieving whatever that existential goal or plan may be.

In our earlier analogy, this prevents 'undercooking' or 'overcooking' of goals. The desire of the Supreme will guide the human desire in real-time in order to get the goal achieved just right. 

Getting it just right requires a specific sequence or flow of steps. The Taoists call this flow as the Tao, while Hindus call it the dharma.



<!-- Religions often talk about the Creator such as God or Allah, but do not explain Their motives for creating the universe. Thus, it is difficult for them to answer questions about the universe. 

This is where Superphysics is different. It views feelings as waves and ideas as particles which support each other to create and maintain existence. 

The different versions of the Supreme Entity as God, Yahweh, Allah, Brahma, etc are then representations of the different desires of the human minds that defined those Entities:

- The Jews desired a Supreme Entity that would lead them to a better land and so they invented Yahweh
- The Romans desired a Supreme Entity that was imperial but merciful and so they invented God from the Yahweh base-idea 
- The Prophet Mohammad desired a Supreme Entity that would force the Arabs into submission and so he invented Allah, also from the Yahweh base-idea
- The Hindus desired a Supreme Entity that explained everything and so they invented Brahma -->



<!-- Consciousness and the social cycles
Jul 21, 2019 · 3 min read

I have often wondered why the Hindus classified all humans and societies under four varnas or classes of shudra (worker), ksattriya (warrior), brahmin (intellectual), and vaesya (merchant). Why not have five or ten classes instead of four?
I got my answer when I read Hume’s explanation on the nature of merchants:
The infallible consequence of all industrious professions is to beget frugality, and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure. Among lawyers and physicians [intellectuals], there are many more who live within their income, than who exceed it, or even live up to it. But lawyers and physicians beget no industry. They even acquire their riches at the expence of others. Merchants, on the contrary, beget industry by serving as canals to convey it through every corner of the state
So the key difference between the intellectual class and the merchant class is physical work. We can say that the change from the intellectual class to the merchant class is the mind of society switching from the abstract metaphysical world, mastered by intellectuals, into the concrete physical world, mastered by workers. The merchant class is the transitory stage between 100% metaphysics and 100% physics, so that:

Likewise, a warrior is a worker that gives importance to metaphysics — planning, strategy, tactics, foresight, etc. That’s why the ideal warrior or leader is the philosopher-king (50% metaphysics, 50% physics). From a philosopher-king he turns into an intellectual (100% metaphysics). From an intellectual, he then turns into merchant (50% metaphysics, 50% physics) and then into a worker (100% physics).
With this, we can see that social cycles are merely groups of human minds switching between physicality and metaphysicality in order to maintain its individual existence in physical reality. A tough physical problem can only be solved by a metaphysical idea, while a questionable metaphysical probability can only be proven in the physical world through real experiments.
You could also say that physicality is one leg while metaphysicality is another leg. Physical existence ‘moves forward’ when both legs work together, focusing one each leg at a time. In contrast, rocks just have physicality and cannot really have any progress, and a good idea is just an idea unless it is implemented in the real world (this is a common issue with inventors and tech startups).

## The Limitations of Materialism

Idea controls mind and mind controls reality. Some people ascribe to materialist ideas and so their reality consequently becomes something that they can't control. 

Nonmaterialists (metaphysicians) do not ascribe to materialist ideas and so they can control their reality. The technical term for this are siddhis (occult powers). There are schools in India and China for this just as there are science universities to teach materialist ideas. 

The governing rules for metaphysics are called dharma. This limits the occult powers to a known range just as a propulsion technology is limited to known Mach speeds. 

Metaphysical experiments work just as well as physical experiments do. In fact, we use metaphysics for agriculture to grow high yield crops at low cost. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3336746/ 

Materialists embrace the easy and obvious. But as a consequence, they miss out on so many other parts of existence that we regard as spiritual or pseudoscience.

This principle is universal and infallible. 

To test it, just absorb the idea that a man-eating monster is outside your door, as to truly believe it. This will then create the reality of you being stuck in your room.
