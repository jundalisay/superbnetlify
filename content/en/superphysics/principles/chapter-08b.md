The Five Elements or Layers of Reality is always useful since it describes how Reality works or is maintained.   

It can be immedately used as a proper goal-setting framework that aligns with the Nature of things. At the moment, the most popular framework is SMART:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable or Achievable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

Under our Five Layers Model, SMART overly emphasizes the Material Layer, and therefore materialist thinking. The problem is that success is really achieved by alignment with the Aethereal layer as the cause, of which the Material layer is just an effect.  

Giving too much emphasis on specifics, measurements, and attainability neuters the mind too much and disconnects it from the infinite possibilities granted by the higher layers. 

 <!-- which I equate to the Five Elements: Akasha(水), Vayu(木), Tejas(火), Jala(土), Pritvi(金). Science only knows 4 of the 5 as strong force, weak force, electromagnetism, and gravitation.  -->

Our solution is the **DSCFD model** which aligns with all of the Five Layers:

Name | Description
--- | ---
Dharmic | is the goal in line with dharma or the Nature of Things?
Start-end | the goal should be encapsulated as an endeavor or project (This is from project management)
Comparable | the progress towards the goal should be comparable to a control or benchmark
Flexible | the goal should have a Plan A, Plan B, etc as many roads can lead to that goal. This also means that the goal itself can be shifted or tweaked a bit
Definable | the goalposts and results should be defined as to be comparable 


Under this system, a genocide or the use of nukes is not a goal because it fails the dharma test, something that SMART does not have. Thus, the DSCFD system has morality baked in.

SMART also does not allow tweaking of the goal itself to match the changing reality. Instead, goals are discarded and new ones are created.  SMART is built for a static universe. DSCFD is built for a dynamic, ever-changing one. 

DSCFD uses general defintions instead of specifics. For example, true love can be a goal if you can generally define what true love is, and this generality is in line with flexibility. 

Under SMART, the goal must be very specific, making the goal fail immediately. For example, a woman might have a goal to find prince charming which she defines specifically under SMART as:

1. Rich
2. Handsome
3. Tall
4. Caring
5. Loyal

But under DSCFD, this manifests as 5 different persons and so looking for these in 1 person might be useless!

DSCFD is an example of using the knowledge of the 5 Elements of Reality to achieve success within that Reality.

After completing the bucket list of things to achieve in Existence, then the person doesn't have to go back to Reality after death (i.e. a soul no longer has any leftover desires or unfinished business, and so can literally and really Rest In Peace RIP).

In this sense, life itself is one big project with a start and end to achieve the purpose or dharma of each living entity. If you fail your purpose, then you go simply back and reincarnate into the Matrix of Existence until you succeed.
