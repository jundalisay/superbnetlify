"Then," you ask, "do you mean to tell us that THE ALL is LIFE and MIND?" 
<br/>
Yes! and No! is our answer.

<cite>The Kybalion</cite>
{{< /q >}}



We said that ideas and feelings are subdivisions of experience:

- experiencer
- experience
  - feelings 
  - ideas

Experiences are powered by 2 Forces:
- The Negative Force leads to experiences
- The Positive leads to the understanding of those experiences

But what about the experiencer or the mind that experiences those ideas and feelings? 

<!-- So far, the matrix of existence has two aspects:
- metaphysical
- physical

The contents of this matrix are only:
- experiencer
- experience (as ideas and feelings) -->

For the experiencer to actually experience the infinite combination of ideas and feelings, it needs a container for them. This metaphysical container or arena is called a mind which is designed to hold and process its own ideas and feelings, which are collectively called 'perceptions'.

Thus, an experiencer has 2 parts:
- mind as the container for experiences
- consciousness as the perceiver of that container

<!-- Instead of using conscio -->

## Metaphysical Mind, Physical Mind

Our system splits reality into a metaphysical domain and a physical domain. This leads to every mind having 2 parts in terms of structure:

1. A metaphysical mind

This is the mind that occupies the metaphysical domain, and is called the soul. Philosophers call this the higher mind, spiritual mind, or subjective mind.

2. A physical mind 

This is the mind that occupies the physical domain. This is what scientists believe in. Philosophers call this the lower mind, crude mind, or objective mind.


{{< q a="Benham" >}}
Recent experiments by scientists have demonstrated that the human being is possessed of a double consciousness or mind. One part operates in our material existence.. The other part operates on the plane of our spiritual existence
<cite>William Benham</cite>

## Living Mind, Non-Living Mind

In terms of activity, physical minds are then classified into two:

- A physical mind that can do its own actions or expressions is called a 'living thing' by humans
- A physical mind that cannot express nor act is called a 'non-living thing'

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/mind.png" alt="Living and non-living mind" cap="A living thing has a mind that can accept external feelings and ideas and likewise express them. A non-living thing cannot, due to the confinement by the Negative Force" >}}


'Life' therefore is an expressive mind that inhabits a physical body. <!-- A 'soul', then, is such a mind that exists independent of a body.  -->

A 'virus' is in-between a non-living idea and a living or expressive mind, that manifests as DNA or RNA. It has to use living things to spread itself as its means of expression or action.

From the viewpoint of the Creator:
- the DNA of viruses and bacteria are simple ideas
- the souls of humans and cats are complex ideas.

But from the viewpoint of viruses and bacteria, they themselves are minds, just as cats and dogs are see themselves as minds (cause) and not as ideas (effect). 

Likewise, we see ourselves as the cause of our own actions instead of being the effect of the Creator (working through us).


## Dharma, Tao, or The True Nature

The independence of the minds of bacteria, cats, dogs, and humans from each other then implies that they have their own innate and unique expressions and experiences different from those of others. Otherwise, they would just be one entity and not separate entities. 

{{< quote ava="aris" >}}
Of which individual then will this be the substance?  Either of all or of none. But it cannot be the substance of all. If it is to be the substance of one, this one will be the others also.
<cite>The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 7, Part 13</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


This innate uniqeness to experience and express Existence is an identity's dharma or tao. Socrates calls this <!-- innate need and design --> as a thing's 'True Nature'* and has been explained in our Law of Conservation of Idea. 

> *The English word 'Nature' is ambiguous and so we use 'Dharma' instead to specify the True Nature passively, and Tao to specify It actively  


{{< q a="soc" >}}
Absolute greatness, health, strength, and the true nature of everything. These cannot be perceived by our bodily organs. The closest we can get to knowing their several natures is through our intellectual vision. This will give us the most exact conception of the  essence of each thing.
<cite>Phaedo by Plato Simplified, Chapter 2</cite>
{{< /q >}}

Lao Tzu calls acting within one's True Nature as being with the Tao. 



## A Dynamic Existence

Since each mind is unique, and since everything is a mind, then all minds must move to keep its uniqueness and separation from others. <!-- with each mind being an idea from the viewpoint of the Creator, then we establish this principle of uniqueness as **The Law of Conservation of Idea**.
- The need to be unique causes the separation between minds and objects.
- This creation of separation then creates change and movement.    --> **Under this paradigm, movement is originally caused by internal differences and not by external forces.** 

Even the external forces from heat really come from the internal nature of hotness that easily affects or moves objects that are internally predisposed to be affected by heat. 

Movement arises from the differences in internal natures. This explains why:
- some objects are easily moveable, while others are difficult to move
- some people are easy to convince, others are very difficult to convince
- some animals are easy to train, others are not easy to train
- some societies advance rapidly, others stay backward

Is there anything in Existence that is not moveable or changeable?


## The One is Not Affected

The only entity that does not move is the entity that created the ideas, minds, and feelings in the Universe.
- The Ancient Greeks call it The One
- Hindus call it Nirguna Brahma
- Buddhists call it Sunya or Void

{{< q a="aris" >}}
The believers of The One [The Pythagoreans] say that The One is the cause of substance. 
<cite>The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Part 8</cite>
{{< /q >}}


Having explained the nature of the mind, we next explain the nature of consciouness which is 'inside' the mind. 

<!-- In the next post, we will explain the difference between The One, as The Absolute, and The Creator, as The Supreme Entity. -->


<!--  Morality is Always Relative -->

<!-- Good and evil then is how this need is protected or destroyed. Thus, morality, or the perception of good and bad, depends on two things:

- the nature of object
- the nature of the experiencers of the object 

This is why morality is always relative and changing. One society might feel that it is moral to be liberal, while another will feel that liberality is immoral and that conservatism is moral.  -->




<!-- In Tantra Yoga, the Supreme Entity merely exists alone, without space nor time. Since a thing exists only if it is perceived, then as an absolute entity, the Supreme Entity technically did not exist and did not have value because It was alone.

To solve this problem, It made perceivers of Itself from Itself (since there was nothing else). In other words, It split Itself into infinite entities, both conscious and unconscious.

The original substance of these entities is called Shiva and the force that splits it up is called Shakti. The original form is called Nirguna Brahma and the resultant form is called Saguna Brahma or the entire observable universe and multiverses.

Since existence was created for the Creator and not the ‘createes’ then by default all existing entities feel an urge to know the Creator. The deepest and most lasting happiness is achieved when it is related to the Creator. This is generally called spirituality. The process for achieving this happiness is called yoga, which aims to unify the createe (soul) with the Creator (pure consciousness). The exact state of union is called samadhi. -->

<!-- Since everything in existence is from the ideas of the Creator of existence, then dharma and morals can be properly attributed to It. -->


<!-- Ideas are static metaphysical objects carved out of the infinity of possible objects. Instead of mass, ideas use probability and all ideas have an equal probability. Even consciousness is an idea. It is its starting point in the physical dimension that makes the difference. For example, if Covid started in Antartica then it would be an insignificant idea. If a galaxy started in an energy-less part of the universe, then it would be insignificant as well. So the idea that supports Covid is its RNA, just as the idea supporting a galaxy is its supermassive black hole and there is no need for dark matter and that's why they will never find it no matter how many MIT or Berkley geniuses they throw at it. -->


<!-- Our solution to differences in moral standards is to get as many feelings as possible and then get the lowest-common-denominator-feeling that can serve as the base of a universal moral system.
