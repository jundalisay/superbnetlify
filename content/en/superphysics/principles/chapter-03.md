The previous chapter explained how everything in Existence begins as either an idea or feeling in the metaphysical domain which then crosses over onto the physical domain as physical reality. 

Everything in the physical domain has a metaphysical counterpart as its origin. We can say that the physical is the effect of the metaphysical. This is also why the metaphysical is superior to the physical. 

All of Physics is dominated by the Law of Conservation of Mass and the Law of Conservation of Energy. This states that:
- mass and energy cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- all processes are transformations of mass and energy.  

<!-- Antoine Lavoisier 1789.  -->

Likewise, all of Superphysics is dominated by what we call **The Law of Conservation of Idea**. This states that all ideas:
- already pre-exist
- cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- are unique.

This uniqueness means that **each idea has its own properties** as imbued by its Creator.
- These inherent properties are called its *dharma* or true nature. <!-- Unlike nature which si -->
- The inherent property of a unique idea or object is called **svadharma**


## Uniqueness Leads to All Movement in Existence

This property of uniqueness creates all of the dynamism in both physical and metaphysical domains. This dynamism is what we call change, movement, and evolution.

For example, suppose you have a tray that can only hold 10 apples. 

{{< img src="/photos/objects/apples.jpg" alt="Apples" >}}


Adding more apples will either:
- make those additional apples fall off if the tray is strong, or
- make the apples in the tray burst out if the tray is weak. 

Either way, the mere addition of apples causes movement, as a reaction to those new additions.

The tray represents the mind of the universe which holds its ideas. The addition of new ideas creates reactions from the already-existing ideas. This leads to movement for those new and old ideas inside the universe-container. 

This movement affects all ideas just as the addition of the apple affects all apples already in the tray -- the more ideas, the more the dynamism and energy.

 <!-- dynamism that is far more energetic than the original addition-action.   -->

From here it follows that:
- the universe is inherently dynamic
- there is an inherent potential dynamism in each object 
- that dynamism can be tapped by letting it interact with the proper objects other than itself
- the dynamism of objects depend on their relations with each other

This is the foundation of our **Theory of Dynamism**. 

This theory aims to know the causes and effects of all movements, whether physical or metaphysical. This is to harness such movement and dynamism in order to reach our goals, such as to solve problems that are unsolved by Physics and Science.  

In the metaphysical domain, these movements take the form of reflection (as the 'bouncing back' mentioned in the previous chapter),  deflection, dissipation, merging, etc. **These are the dynamics of waves.** Thus, we say that **the metaphysical domain has a wave-like nature**.   


## All Ideas are Static, All Movement Comes from Minds

<!-- Aethereal Relativity is concerned with the movement of ideas* as qoas (quantum of aether), such as how the idea of a horse-carriage moved and evolved into an automobile and then into an electric car, and then into a flying electric car in the future.   -->

A Creator is above, or superior to, its creations. 

Since Existence is only made up of ideas and feelings, then it follows that the Creator is above its ideas and feelings, even the idea of space and time. 

This means that all possible ideas have already been created (time is finished) and that the dynamism has already worn-off, since there is no more addition-action. To the Creator, all ideas have settled into perfection and are therefore static. 

However, this is opposite of our assertion that the Universe is dynamic, as we can plainly see. Even our ideas change, so how can ideas be static? 

This is because the staticity of ideas are from the viewpoint of the Absolute, before or after it takes the role of a Creator. This Absolute is in its own domain which we call 'Pre-Existence'.

As it this domain is above Existence, it does not exist. Rather it is entirely probabilistic or theoretical. 

It is a concept created to explain how Existence is generated arbitrarily or probabilistically by desire. This is why **the control of desire** is:
- one of the central tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism, and
- an important part of Islam which is imposed through fasting, charity, and modesty.  

Since ideas are static, it follows that it is the mind and its consciousness that moves from idea to idea in order to create compound ideas and experiences. This creates action and reaction, which are explained in the next chapter.





<!-- The Greeks of 500 BC got their ideas from the Hindus which had those ideas since 2000 BC. 

Timaeus got his four elements from the five elements of the Hindus, just as Socrates got his reincarnation and whorls from the reincarnation and chakras of the Hindus, just as Parmenides got his The One from Brahma idea. 

Even Stoicism from Zeno of 300 BC came from Buddhism of 500 BC. 

The difference is that those original ideas were in Sanskrit and not English. Rather the English version came from the Greek version which came from the Sanskrit version. But your mind is biased and so it stops at the Greek version and does not stretch to the original Indian version because that would mean that Indians were once intellectuallly superior to the warlike Europeans.

<!--  are static and non-moving, and it is the created minds that move from one idea to another. However, our perspective as humans is from the created minds. And so, for the purposes of explanation, we will take the opposite view and see our minds as stationary and ideas as moving. -->



<!-- Movement, Cause and Effect
The law of conservation of mass and energy is:

Matter and Energy cannot be created nor destroyed 


We extend this to the aethereal layer of ideas and feelings:

Ideas and Feelings cannot be created nor destroyed
