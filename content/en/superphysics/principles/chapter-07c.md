The previous chapters explained that:
- Existence is in the mind for the purpose of being experienced by the perceiver or consciousness
- A mind can only be active or inactive, just as consciousness can only be be `on` or `off`
- Desire, as a type of feeling and effect of the Two Forces, is the engine for the creation of anything in existence 
- All Existence is then made up of ideas and feelings molded by the Two Forces
  - Ideas are sensed by the mind's intellect 
  - Feelings are sensed by the mind's heart 


We also said that the mind is like an arena or theater where ideas and feelings are perceived. With this analogy, we can group the different abilities or operations of the mind into 4: 

1. Thinking: This is similar to the manipulating the actors and props

2. Remembering: This is similar to props being stored and retrieved backstage 

3. Learning: This is similar to the improvement of the theater in the way it manipulates (thinks) and stores and retrieves its props (remembers) 

4. Expanding or Contracting: This is similar to the expansion of a theater in order to have better shows



## Thinking

The main job of the intellectual mind is to think about its ideas.
- The act of thinking is the perception and connection of ideas  

The main job of the emotional mind is to discern its feelings.
- The act of feeling is the perception and immersion of feelings

We then group this thinking operation into 2 categories:

<!-- From here, we can say that all of the activities or operations of the mind's intellect can be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Adding or Combinative
2. Subtracting or Separative

We also group this feeling operation into 2 categories:
<!-- The activities or operations mind's heart can also be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Attraction
2. Repulsion

Attraction has a combinative net effect just as repulsion has a separative one. 

Therefore the active mind, which thinks and feels, has 2 kinds of operations:
- Combination
  - This comes from the Positive Force
- Separation
  - This comes from the Negative Force

<!-- Note that memory is a quality of the mind, and not an operation. Remembering is part of the operations of consciousness, just as perception is.  -->

## The Operations of Thinking 
<!-- the Intellect -->

"Adding" or "combination" is the integration of one identity to another to create a new third identity. This is an effect of the Positive Force (Yang or Shiva)

For example, we:
- add `1 + 1` to make `2` 
- put more rice grains in a bag to make it reach 1 kilogram for purchase
- step in an empty bus so it can get passengers and start its journey


"Subtracting" or "separation" is the removal of one part of an identity in order to create a new identity. This is an effect of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti or Prakrti)

For example, we:
- subtract `3 - 1` to make `2`
- remove things from our luggage so that it will meet the limit of 15 kilograms 
- step out of an overloaded bus so that it can run safely


Related operations of thinking spring from these 2 broad operations:

Combination Category:
- Multiplication
- Exponents
- Memory or Remembering
- etc

Separation Category:
- Division and Fractions
- Square roots
- Ignorance or Forgetting
- etc
<!-- - Factorials and Multiples -->



## The Operations of Feeling
<!-- the Heart -->

Attraction is the tendency to move towards an object. 

Its related oprations are:
- Love
- Friendship
- Cooperation
- Society
- Buying
- Arriving
- Marriage or Being a couple
- etc


Repulsion is the tendency to move away an object. 

- Hate
- Animosity
- War
- Isolation
- Selling
- Leaving
- Divorce or Breaking up
- etc


### Usefulness of Combinative and Separative

All the operations of thinking and feeling<!-- mind, through the intellect and feelings, --> thus fall into those 2 categories. This categorization is very useful for understanding the root cause of mental problems. 

For example, Modern psychology detaches the intellect from the heart when dealing with memory problems such as dementia or Alzheimer's. This makes its cause unknown. 

However, with our combined model, we point out that intellectual memory loss is separative action of the mind, as forgetting. The solution is to counteract this intellectual separative action with a combinative feeling action (since feelings are superior to intellect).

This manifests as people having better social bonds. This is why positive social interaction is essential to avoid Alzheimer's and other mental diseases.     

This categorization system also works for Physics as artificial intelligence or AI. 

For example, Physicists are unable to create real AI because they neglect the feeling aspect. We solve this by adding social interaction data as part of the training data for our proposed Artificial Sentience system called ISAIAH.

<!-- The separation of memory from remembering is useful in:
- Bio Superphysics for memory problems, dementia, and
- Material Superphysics for the creation of artificial sentience. -->

<!-- For example, the interplay of desire, mind-memory, and consciousness explains why  -->


## Remembering, Learning, and Expanding

The other abilities of the mind can be explained in Bio Superphysics. 

The next chapter will explain the layers of the mind, as the layers of the universe.
