Chapter 4a explained that reality is made up of long perception-chains of cause and effects, called by the Hindus as ''karma-samskara-karma'. 

A long series of chains gains the dynamics of a wave. This wave we can split into 3 states:

1. Karma-Action State 1
2. Samskara-Pending State 2
3. Karma-Reaction State 3 

We can extend this wave to have more states.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/wave.jpg" alt="Wave" cap="A wave is made up of many different states which reveal a hidden focus or dharma which we call a 'gravitational signature' to make it sound scientific" >}}

We can know why State 7 is the way it is if we look at all its states from 1 to 6. We can then use this knowledge to predict its future states. We can write this as:

```elixir
State 1 : State 3 : State 5 :: State 7
```


We do not notate States `2`, `4`, and `6` since they are pending reactions to States `1`, `3`, and `5`, respectively and have no objective manifestation in reality.

The colon means 'relative to' or 'compared to', and is a fundamental part of our proposed 'Qualimath'. 

This is different from normal math which uses 'deltas'.
- Those deltas compare the object with itself at different states.
- This is because math focuses on the object itself, and not on the totality of the reality where that object is in.

For example, a basic math equation is `1 + 1 = 2`. This can be visualized by:

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/line.jpg" alt="Line" cap="Addition of distance leads to a new location" >}} 

Notice how this is overly simplistic and does not expand on cause and effect. We turn this into qualimath by adding the necessary parts:

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/linequali.jpg" alt="Line" cap="We qualimath a line" >}}

Here, we expose that the focus of the equation or line is itself. The qualimath equation is `State 1 :: State 2` which we deconstruct as:

```elixir
(1 + 1) :: 2
```

This leads to the same output as the `1 + 1 = 2` of normal math, while imposing the following mental changes:

- `1 + 1` is a rigid ratio of `2`, not an equality. This makes it flexible and anti-dogma. This is useful when it comes to constants
- Both sides have the same importance
- A straight-line equation would imply that the focus is on the line itself. 

The concept of a *focus* is super important as it is the basis of:
- gravitational signatures
- the hierarchy of the universe
- Descartes' [First and Third Rules of Movement](/material/principles/intro/chapter-03) 


## A More Complex Example

Let's say we want to convert `17 * 19 = 323` to Qualimath. This will create 3 states in our sandbox:

- State 1 for `17`
- State 2 for `19`
- State 3 for the `answer`

We notate this as `State 1 :: State 3`, deconstructed as `(17 * 19) :: answer` 

We use Egyptian Math, as Al-Khwarizmis algorithms, to deconstruct `17` (State 1) into its doubles as a ratio of the doubles of `19` (State 2).

{{< youtube wciL_yCmZe8 >}}


State 1: 17 | State 2: 19 
--- | ---
**1** | **19**
2 | 38
4 | 76
8 | 152
**16** | **304**


We use State 1 as the focus and add the corresponding values in State 2 to get State 3 as `323`*. 


> *`323` = `304` [as 5th row of State 2 or `16`] + `19` [as 1st row of State 1 or `1` to get `17`]
<!-- We can add to this equation such as multiplying `323` by `2` to get `646`. -->

Here, the smaller number is put before the larger. In case of multiple multipliers, the first 2 are combined then rearranged, then multiplied with the latter multipliers. 
<!-- This smaller-to-higher arrangement is similar to  -->


This use of states, foci, and arrangements greatly simplifies math instead of making it boring and burdensome.

### Decon Notation: Solving the Measurement Problem

We can further simplify math by assigning qualities to our deconstructed equations since waves are more qualitative than quantitative in nature.   

<!-- To get around this shortage, we will use *the qualitative aspects of waves* that combines its qualities such as amplitude, oscillation, vector, wavelength, etc.  -->

For example, in `Wave 1 + Wave 2 = Wave 3`, we assign qualities instead of numbers and processes so we can arrive at the general outcome faster. 

The `+` and `=` represent the natural operations of the human mind. The minds of less advanced species, such as penguins, might be capable of `+` and `-`, but are not capable of `*` or `/`. Likewise, human minds are limited to `=` and do not dwell so much on `:` which reqresents the hidden connection between things. 

<!-- Since it deals with qualities instead of quantities, we can call it **Decon Notation** and its underlying system as **Quali-math**.  -->

This solves measurement problems by allowing anyone to create a *subjective* measure. For example, assuming a predefined intuitive range of qualitative* values which *focus* on looks:


``` elixir
abominable, hideous, very ugly, ugly, unattractive, soso, pretty, beautiful, very beautiful, gorgeous, drop-dead gorgeous
```


> *Qualities are subjective



Then we can create equations:

``` elixir
pretty + pretty = beautiful
beautiful + 2(ugly) = ugly
hideous + beautiful = ugly
```

This can then be “translated” into any language*:

``` elixir
maganda + maganda = sobrang ganda
kaakit-akit + kadiri = napaka-pangit
dep + dep = rat dep
```


> *This is important because Superphysics uses many non-English words like aether, monad, jiva, atman, bhuta, guna, chi, wu-xing, etc. In fact, we propose an overhaul of English, as Lish, to make it more intuitive. For example, add 's' to pluralize nouns so that oxs, datas, childs would be correct. But that is a totally different topic.


<!-- In a future post, we will expand this into chemical compounds computation, and in linear algebra to produce general qualitative outcomes instead of exact quantitative answers.  -->

A sample implementation is our use of ["male and female" charges](/material/electrons-are-positive) for particles instead of the "positive and negative" used by Benjamin Franklin. In theory, this would lead to new chemical compounds that are unthinkable in Physics, since it is more intuitive to combine different kinds of males with different kinds of females. 

This quali-math will make the most sense when you think of a spaceship using quantum teleportation that not only will use 2D space as in a car on Earth or a 3D space like an aircraft, but a space with four or five dimensions as time-multiverses and alternative universes, where normal math breaks down.

For example, `1 + 1 = 2` might be true for this universe, but it might not be true for a different universe where `1 + 1 = 1` or where the conception of two ideas automatically merges them into one idea. In such a universe, it is the mind that splits itself into different perception-units in order to create the idea of numbers. This is the opposite in our universe, where the perceiving entity is one, and the it is the observed entities that are multiples and discrete. 


## The Double Colon 

To account for this mind-splitting behavior, <!--  make ratios and relativity permanent, --> we propose a new notation using flexible colons instead of the rigid equals sign. The former represents the flexible nature of the universe as opposed to its strict rigidity as the latter.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/math.jpg" alt="Mathematics" >}}


We can think of the double colon as a rigid equals sign, while the single colon as a flexible ratio. This ratio represents our theory of  "universal relativity*" which is represented in reality by [gravitational relativity](/material/universal-relativity), among others.


> *All philosophers say that everything is connected, even the sophistical pseudo-philosopher John Stuart Mill. The ratio sign signifies this connection. In this way, we can say that the universe is an unending chain of multiple layered ratios, as a matrix, where a change in one part causes a change in the whole universe as a chain-effect. The lower dimensions like ours has more rigid ratios that lead to discrete and 'hardened' identities, while higher dimensions have more flexible ratios that lead to more malleable ones.


{{< me date="March 10, 2022" >}}
An example of the "hardness" of this dimension is the hardness of will of Russia in invading Ukraine and in Ukraine stubbornly not giving up, not caring about the chain-reaction that it causes to other nations and the planet. 

In a better universe (with qualimath as the norm), Russia, Ukraine, and NATO will "soften" their minds and egos (less strong force, more gravitational force) as to harmonize with each other, being more sensible how their actions affect the planet.

In this universe, such a softening can be encouraged by emphasizing the abstract, flexible aether, over rigid and hard solid matter.

## The State Limiter

In `1 + 1 = 2`, the mind sweeps from the left to the right. But in `(1 + 1) :: 2`, the mind splits itself into the left and the right. It becomes an impartial spectator* of both sides or states.

> *This idea was developed by Adam Smith who criticized the sophistical math of the mercantile system. Such sophistry now manifests as the strict demand for GDP growth by Economics which is currently causing mass exctinction and conflicts.


In this way, the formula of economist John Maynard Keynes for money supply `M` as being affected by liquidity preference `L` and interest rate `r` 

```elixir
M = Lr
```
#
becomes:


```elixir
M :: (L : r)
```
#

when deconstructed:

```elixir
money_supply :: (liquidity_preference : interest-rate)
```
#

Likewise, Newton's gravity changes from 

```elixir
F = (Gm1m2)/r^2
```
# 

into


```elixir
`F :: (G (m1/r^2 : m2/r^2))`
```


Notice how this isolates Newton's `G` away from the two masses being compared. In price equations, this will allow us to more easily remove the influence of interest rates (of the financial system) and taxes (of the government)  in order to reveal the natural price ratios from their own perspective. The gravity, interest rates, and taxes enter their own abstraction called a *limiter*. Moreover, this system does not require PEMDAS.

We then deconstruct it further:

<!-- `gravity between objects :: Gravitational_limiter (Mass1 / distance_between_them ^ 2 : Mass2 / distance_between_them ^ 2)` -->
<!-- material-layer-gravitational-signature -->

```elixir
gravity_between :: (material_layer_limiter (matter_amount_in_identity1 / distance_between^2 : matter_amount_in_identity2 / distance_between^2)
```

## Math with a Practical and Moral Purpose Inspired by Al-Khwarizmi and Descartes


The above decontstructed equation gives us two benefits:

1. Practical: It helps us *code* the equation more easily into procedures and algorithms
2. Moral: It makes us think of `Mass1` and `Mass2` independently, and separate from its limiter

Quali-math is inspired by **Al-Khwarizmi** who invented algebra from his work on "Calculation by Completion and Balancing". 

The practical purpose leads to algorithms, the invention of which has likewise been attributed to Al-Khwarizmi*. This is important because [automated intelligence](/superphysics/ai-is-autonomous) is one of the goals of Superphysics.


{{< img cap="Automated intelligence is best used in space-time-ships, just as it is best applied currently in Tesla's self-driving cars" src="/photos/physics/phoenix.jpg" >}}




> *The original purpose of Algebra (Al-Jebra or 'the repair or healing') was to divide an estate and compute the inheritance due to each heir. <!-- The Europeans seemed to have used it for warmaking --> This matches the problem-solving nature of Superphysics. This is opposite of Einstein's math as sophistical tensors coming from his wild imagination which creates more problems. It is also different from Newton's Calculus which originated from plotting curvilinear motion. Superphysics allows teleportation which totally negates curvilinear motion.   


An AI-driven* ship in our universe that teleports into another universe with different physics rules can transpose its logic and definitions more easily to match that universe. This is because it uses quality instead of quantity. 

> *The mind-splitting behavior in quali-math can be implemented with computers with multiple independent cores. In humans, this is naturally done in families and societies. The family mind is split between the father, mother and children. The society's mind is split between the different classes represented by political parties and special-interest groups.  


A qualitative definition in one’s mind retains itself even if its mind moves into another universe. *This is because that defintion is always anchored in the ego (feeling of the self) of that mind.* This was implied by Adam Smith:

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
I can only fairly compare those big objects and the small objects near me by transporting myself in fancy, to a place from where I can survey both at equal distances, and judge their real proportions.
<cite>Theory of Moral Sentiments</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


Because of this, quali-math also creates moral effects. It conditions minds to respect the identity and natures of all sides (other egos), instead of bulldozing over them with arbitrary notations and movement towards one side or result as what Westerners tend to do. 

While the practical aspect is based on [Al-Khwarizmi](/research/musa/algebra/chapter-01), this moral aspect is based on Rene Descartes who invented exponents and the Cartesian plane, among others, from his realizations on how the mind works*, as well as David Hume from whom Adam Smith got his ideas.


<!-- This is in line with the Hindus inventing zero to represent the existence of nothingness. Rather, zero implies that space is empty *but is actually meant by Nature to be filled* (since Nature abhors a vacuum). The Romans and the ancient Chinese did not have such an advanced metaphysical concept. Aristotle had, but did not seem to deploy it into reality.

Qualimath also bridges modern math, which 'prefers' single integers or the small picture or 'micro', with ancient Egyptian math, which 'prefers' the large view or 'macro'. Thus, it harmonizes the different ways of looking at existence, making it more flexible and dynamic:

- Modern math from the micro going macro
- Ancient Egyptian math from the macro going micro
- Hindu (Vedic) math grouping and scaling identities via zero
