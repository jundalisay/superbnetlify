Chapter 3 explained how the Law of Conservation of Idea creates dharma, as well as movement and dynamism. 

Chapter 4c explained the concept of gravitational signatures as notations of svadharma. 

Chapter 5 explained how the Two Forces create attraction and repulsion as examples of such movement. 

Combining these gives us the Elastic Theory of Gravity which is applicable in many areas such as:
- Economics as price movements
- Sociology as international relations and cultural interaction
- Relationships as marriage and divorce 
- Physics as gravitation and magnetism
- Medicine as disease and wellness


which is the cause of all movement and change in the universe.

All of this movement is caused by the creation or existence of other ideas, which manifest as entities in the physical domain. The rule on uniqueness makes those entities move away from each other. This leads to our Theory of Dynamism. 



Here we explain 'The Elastic Theory' or the Theory of Elastic Gravitational Bands which is a consolidation of the theories from:

- Socrates, as the relativity of the motions in the heavens
- Kepler, as the links of kinship between planetary bodies
- Descartes, as the aether powering all movement
