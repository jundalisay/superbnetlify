plotting a course

form a broad general goal 

move towards that goal

choose avenues 

if avenue prevents you then take a step back and find a nother avenue

if avenue is good then choose a subavenues from it. Do not be afraid to take a step back, since not all decisions are correct the first time 

get experience from . choose future possibilities thatyou want

experience will let you gain a hang of patterns or how the Aether moves. So you can just move forward faster using more and more of intuitin and less of intellect.
