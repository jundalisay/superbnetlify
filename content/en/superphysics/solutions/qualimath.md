Our proposed revival of Descartes' Physics has its own math called Qualimath which focuses on state-change instead of the linear processing of discrete quantities.  

For example, in 1 + 1 = 2, the mind takes identity 1 and combines it with another identity 1 to create a new identity 2, removing the previous identities.  

Qualimath on the other hand, writes it as (1 + 1) :: 2.  

The identity 1 is combined with identity 1 in State A.  This then leads to a new State B where the former identities are replaced with a new identity 2.  

Unlike math which destroys the 1 + 1, Qualimath preserves the both sides, and does not 'refactor' nor delete any side.   

This is because math is designed to work on the material layer, where matter's identity can get mixed up.   

For example, if you put 1 liter of milk to 1 liter of tea, then you get 2 liters of milktea.  

On the other hand, Qualimath is designed to work on the aethereal layer, the aether being the material of ideas, feelings, and the mind that has those ideas and feelings.   

For example, if you double your happiness now (State 1), then you get double-happiness (State 2).  

But today's double-happiness will be different from that of tomorrow (State 3).   

So Qualimath focuses on state and state change, whereas math focuses on the contents of those states.   

Math never questions why in 1 + 1, it had to add 1 and 1 in the first place.   

In the West, the aether was described by the Greeks. In the East, it was described by the Hindus, as akasha.   

The Greeks got it from the Egyptians who had a math that also focused on states.   

Here we translate the math operation 17 x 19 = 323 into its Qualimath version as (17 x 19) :: 323.   

We then use Egyptian math which doubles an identity successively until it matches the identity of the first state.   

Then the identity of the second state is successively doubled until it matches the successive identities in the first state.   

Combining the two states leads to the final state as the answer.  

States are essential to Descartes' (Cartesian) Physics because his 1st Rule defines inertia as state-continuity, and movmement as state-change.  

Moreover, Cartesian Physics is based on the aether which moves instantly and not in a sequential manner.  

This is why calculus is irrelevant to it, but is so important to Newtonian Physics which is based on sequential material movement, instead of aethereal state-change.  

With Qualimath, we can now provide aethereal empirical evidence of Cartesian Physics to augment the material evidence of Newtonian Physics in order to complete the explanation of Reality and how it is generated in real-time as a never ending chain of state-change.
